{"/":{"title":"Add Lightness","content":"# what is lightness\n\nIn the context of design and engineering, \"lightness\" refers to the reduction of weight or mass in a product or structure without compromising its strength, stability, or performance. Lightness is often sought after because it can result in greater efficiency, improved performance, and reduced resource consumption, while still maintaining or improving the quality and durability of the product.\n\nFor example, in the automotive industry, \"adding lightness\" has been a guiding principle for many high-performance sports cars, with automakers using lightweight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase speed and handling. In the aerospace industry, reducing the weight of aircraft and spacecraft is critical for efficiency and safety.\n\nIn design, lightness can also refer to the appearance or perception of lightness, even if the actual weight or mass of the object has not been reduced. For example, a product with a minimalist or streamlined design might appear \"light\" and unobtrusive, even if it is physically heavy.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:03:35.62690828Z","tags":null}}
