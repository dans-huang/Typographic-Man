You have to allow things to go bad or die, so it can also possibly go well and thrive.\n\nA story with only good ending already loses its magic. If one is destined to be a hero, then it takes away half of the STRIVING already. Alan Watts: \"The future you can predict is already the past.\"\n\nOur good comes from God, as its the potential seeded in us, however we're not designed to always be good but free instead, so the potential have all its different ways to manifest, which makes the striving toward God that much more valuable rather than predestined. A plant has its potential to become a giant tree but you need it to happen in the wild where no protection or pre-designed environment can save it from being stroke by a lightning and where everything can go wrong and it might die at any given time, that's how the real potential will shine through the harsh nature and let it grow so large that will humble we mere mortals. It humbles us because its a manifestation of God's good that is stored in every living thing as potential, and the vision of this giant tree truly \"calls out\" to our inner potential for the highest good.\n\nPotential can only be fully fulfilled by freedom, and that's why freedom and individual sovereignty are the most fundamental values for a human society.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research/.stversions//%E6%96%AF%E9%87%8C%E8%98%AD%E5%8D%A1%E5%9B%A0ESG%E7%A0%B4%E7%94%A2~20230118-235258":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: \n[各國衝刺ESG，卻讓饑荒風險增高？斯里蘭卡破產，給全球的啟示](https://www.businessweekly.com.tw/carbon-reduction/blog/3010231)\n[破產的斯里蘭卡，ESG評級幾乎是完美？商周錯了](https://professorlin.com/2022/07/23/%E7%A0%B4%E7%94%A2%E7%9A%84%E6%96%AF%E9%87%8C%E8%98%AD%E5%8D%A1%EF%BC%8Cesg%E8%A9%95%E7%B4%9A%E5%B9%BE%E4%B9%8E%E6%98%AF%E5%AE%8C%E7%BE%8E%EF%BC%9F%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E9%8C%AF%E4%BA%86/)\n\n---\n- 根據[World Economics數據](https://worldeconomics.com/Country-Data/Sri%20Lanka.aspx)，斯里蘭卡在總分100分的ESG評級中，Environment（環境保護）幾乎是完美的98.1分，海地 99 分，美國58 分。\n- 逃到新加坡的斯里蘭卡總統拉賈帕克薩（Gotabaya Rajapaksa）在2019年競選時就承諾要在10年內將該國改造成世界第一個全面有機的國家。他的政府在2020年3月開始逐步禁止化學肥料進口，然後在隔年4月26日更立法禁止所有化學肥料、除草劑、殺蟲劑等化學物質的使用。在禁令實施後的六個月內，該國三分之一的農地休耕，而原本非常充足的稻米產量下降了 20%，不得不進口 4.5 億美元的稻米來滿足國內需求，米價更上漲了近 50%。政府為了要彌補農作的損失，除了向全國農民支付 2 億美元之外，還向遭受損失的稻農支付 1.49 億美元的價格補貼。但背負巨債的農民說這樣的補償根本就不夠。 據估計，僅茶葉產業——斯里蘭卡的主要出口和外匯來源——就損失了 4.25 億美元。請看[Sri Lanka’s Organic Experiment Went Very, Very Wrong](https://modernfarmer.com/2022/03/sri-lanka-organic-experiment/)（斯里蘭卡的有機實驗大錯特錯）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq01p02ayf82xvpkp5v29adk))\n- 目前地球最大石油生產國並不是沙烏地阿拉伯，而是美國，可從未聽到任何人就美國對維持全球石油供應，以及豐富的石油維持國際穩定的重要性發表任何類似的聲明。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq01ehepzp054b84kxxj02q8))\n- 受新冠疫情大流行、俄烏戰爭、OPEC（石油輸出國組織）減產，以及歐洲日益嚴重的能源危機，主要就是由於長期供應不足的國際原油市場，但另一個關鍵原因就是美國是世界排名第一的供應國，但與 2018 和 2019 年最高水準相比，美國石油工業仍比每天約 100 萬桶石油少。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq01ekdp2a6ngx21wxmmzxfz))\n- 目前全球有 3.45 億人因飢餓掙扎在死亡邊緣，相比年初 2.76 億增加 24%，並為 2020 年新冠疫情大爆發前 1.35 億的兩倍，主要就是因為能源不足和糧食飆漲影響，而且預估未來幾個月還會攀升得更高，甚至有 45 國 5 千萬人離飢荒僅一步之遙。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq01fan2ar3mnqtdwvn6s7nb))\n- 糧食短缺是由於政府將實現氣候和 ESG 目標，置於比糧食生產更優先排序的結果，斯里蘭卡政府垮台的一個原因，正是因為當局 2021 年 4 月要求農民從化肥轉向有機肥，導致作物大幅降低產量，儘管斯里蘭卡政府意識到嚴重性，並試圖於 2021 年 11 月扭轉局面，但為時已晚。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq01fh627w1z4ezy41khxkw3))\n- 荷蘭政府的 ESG 評級為 90.7，雖然在歐洲國家中排名倒數第三，但上個月荷蘭宣布大幅削減氮和氨排放的計劃，可能迫使許多農業關閉，因為對 ESG 的偏好高於糧食生產，並引發規模龐大的抗議活動，讓人想起今年初在加拿大發生的卡車司機抗議活動。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq01fsxryq0jbr70x2wxqy4v))\n- 世界各地政府都以實現氣候和 ESG 為主，犧牲養活人口、使公民冬季保持家園溫暖的代價，奇怪的是，當這些決定及損害導致社會動盪時，這些政治領導人似乎真的感到驚訝 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq01gk8cftwm6n5x9y367dhz))\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research/.stversions//Analyzing-Dads-Fundamental-Viewpoints~20230125-022032":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌱 \nlinks: [[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[Meditations on Moloch]]\n[[Alex Epstein -

makes us pursue things, build things, create things, makes us want new things that we don't currently already have, and so it has a lot of dimensions to it. \nbut rather than think about dopamine as a signal for reward - like a dopamine hit we classically think and talk about - it's more accurate to think about dopamine as driving motivation and craving to go seek rewards** \n**and  it's a way of tabulating where we are in our life**  are we doing well or are we doing poorly and that  happens on very short time scales like you wake up  feeling good or do you wake up feeling kind of low  \nor on long time scales if you're halfway through  a long degree or you're halfway through your life  how are you doing how do you gauge that well it  has everything to do with how much dopamine you  were releasing in the previous days and weeks and  years \nso you're always comparing and all of this  is subconscious \nbut what's cool is that **once you  make these processes conscious once you understand  a little bit about how dopamine is released and  how it changes our perspective and our behavior  then you can actually work with it** and \nso  we go back to this example the person that's  not motivated that can't get off the couch  that doesn't want to do anything well this  is the problem \nthey are effectively the rat  with no dopamine but they can still achieve  some sense of pleasure by consuming excess  calories by consuming social media and \nlook i'm  not judging i do this stuff too right scrolling  social media \nif you've ever scrolled social media  and you're like i don't even know why i'm  doing this it doesn't really feel that good  \nand i can remember a time where you'd  see something it was just so cool or you  see something online i remember this when ted  talks first came out i was like this is amazing  these are some at least some of them are really  smart people sharing really cool insights  and then now that they're like a gazillion ted  talks \ni remember spending a winter in my office at  when i was a junior professor cleaning my office  finally and binging ted talks in the background  thinking this is a good use of my time pretty soon  they all sucked to me i was like this isn't good \nso what you need to do is stop watching Ted talks for a while, wait and then they become interesting  again and that's this pain pleasure balance\nand  \nso for people that aren't feeling motivated, the problem is they're not motivated. but they're getting just enough or excess sustenance, so they're getting the little mild hits of opioid - it becomes an opioid system. \nif you think  about the opioid drugs as opposed to dopamine / dopaminergic drugs,\ndopaminergic drugs make people rabid for everything: drugs of abuse like cocaine, amphetamine make people incredibly outward directed, or they hardly notice anything except what they want more of - one more, more. it's  very bad because those drugs trigger so much  dopamine release that they become the reward - it's  very circular. the only the drug can give that  much dopamine, nothing they could pursue would  give them as much dopamine as the drug itself. so  there's that. \n\nand then there's the kind of opioid like effects of constantly indulging oneself with social media or with video games or with with food or with anything to the point where it no longer evokes the motivation and craving.\n\nand **this is really the new evolution of the understanding of dopamine in neuro in neuroscience, which is that dopamine itself is not the reward, it's the build up to the reward. and the reward has more of a kind of opioid bliss-like property which itself is not bad if it's endogenous released from within. \nbut when we can just sit there - like the rat with no dopamine - gorging ourselves with pleasures, so to speak, what you end up with is somebody that feels really unmotivated and those pleasures no longer work to tickle those feel good circuits and so there's no reason for them to go out and pursue anything.**\n**the problem is not pleasures, the problem is that pleasure experienced without prior requirement for pursuit is terrible for us.**\nit's terrible  for us as individuals, it's terrible for us as as  groups, and i have great confidence in the human  species to work this out \n\nbut **we are finding  now and we are going to increasingly find, that those who will be successful - young or old - are going to be those people who can create their  own internal buffers.** \n**they're going to be able to  control their relationship to pleasures because  the proximity to pleasures and the availability  is the problem.** \n\nif you look at the increase in use of drug abuse or prescription medication, which at least at the first pass deliver pleasure / pain relief. the whole issue with the opioid crisis and dopaminergic drugs like ritalin adderall - sometimes there's a clinical need - is that tons of people are taking those recreationally  now or to study huge dopamine increases are what  those cause \nthat is a problem that's a serious  problem because it creates a cycle where you you  need more of that specific thing \ni always say  **addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure**\ni don't  like to comment too much on enlightenment because  you know i don't really know what that is as a  neurobiologist but \n**a good life - we could say - is a progressive expansion of the things that bring  you pleasure and even better is a good life is a  progressive expansion of the things that bring you  pleasure and includes pleasure through motivation  and hard work** \n**and understanding this pain-pleasure  balance, whereby if you experience pain and you can  continue to be in that friction and exert effort, the rewards are that much greater when they arrive**  \nand so i think that if you look at any drug  of abuse or any situation where somebody  isn't motivated or thinks that now they may  have clinically diagnosed attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder \nbut a lot of what people  think is adhd it turns out is people just over  consuming dopamine from various sources and then  and also the context within a tick-tock feed is  the context switch is insane \nthe brain has never  seen first of all there's the first time in human  evolution that we wrote with our thumbs but that's  a pretty benign shift \nand that the other shift is  normally you walk from one room to another or from  a field into the trees or from a hut into or a  house or whatever it is \nbut now you can get 10 000  context switches in that 30 minutes of scrolling  on instagram or to talk \nand **so it's all about  self-regulation - we are going to select for the  people that can self-regulate** \nand so then people  say well how do you self-regulate how do kids  self-regulate well this is my hope \nand one of the  reasons i've gotten excited about public education  and teaching neuroscience is that \nthis is a place  where knowledge of knowledge actually can allow  oneself to intervene \nwhen you think i'm feeling  low i don't feel good nothing really feels like  am i depressed maybe \nbut maybe you're just you've  saturated the dopamine circuits you're now in the  pain part of things \nwhat do you do well you have  to stop you need you need to replenish dopamine  you need to stop engaging with this behavior  and then your pleasure for it will come back  but you have to constantly control the hinge \nit's  not just about being back and forth on the seesaw  you have to make sure the hinge doesn't get stuck  in pain or in pleasure \nunderstanding that pain  and pleasure in this really dynamic balance  can also help us which in the following way  \nany pain that you feel the longer day the less  sleep the the kind of agony that things aren't  working that power outlet doesn't work  or the internet is slow whatever it is  \n**the amount of pleasure that you will eventually  experience is directly relation related  to how much pain you experience** \nso we know this  from actually what nowadays would be considered  quite barbaric and unethical experiments  where they would give people electrical shocks  and they would measure their response and then  they'd say we're going to increase it we're  going to increase it \neventually they get to the  point where a slight shock that was previously  very painful actually evokes a sense of pleasure  now you couldn't do these experiments anymore  these are not the experiments i do in my lab and  these are older experiments \nbut for instance i  and this has been discussed in scientific research  papers uh giving somebody a like a ten minute ice  bath for instance or even a three-minute ice bath  or a one-minute ice bath it's quite painful \nbut  there was a study from the university of prague  uh european journal **physiology showed that  after a painful ice bath stimulus the amount of  dopamine release goes up for two and a half hours  to 250 percent above baseline \nand that's not  because the ice bath itself evokes dopamine  release** - a lot of people think oh cold water of ox  dopamine release no - \n**pain evokes dopamine release  after the pain is over** \n\njust understanding **the more  friction and pain that you experience the greater  the dopamine reward you will get later and that  serves as its own amplifier of the whole process  of pursuing more dopamine** \n\n**so the keys are to  pursue rewards but understand that the pursuit is actually the reward if you want to have repeated wins.\n\n**then what you realize is your capacity to tap into dopamine as a motivator not  just seeking dopamine rewards that is infinite**\n\n養大了一整個世代沒有暴露在風險之下、沒有能力駕馭這些事情的孩子，在社會層面上是個尤其悲劇的事。 - [[Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World]]\n\n讓我們從 耶穌意思的反面 開始。 許多人認為\"十字架\"是他們生活中必須 背負 的 重擔： 一段緊張的關係，一份吃力不討好的工作，一種身體上的疾病。 因著自憐的驕傲，他們說，\"那是我必須背負的十字架。\"這樣的解釋並不是耶穌所說的\" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我\"。  \n  \n當耶穌 背 著他的十字架 到各各他被釘死十架時， 沒有人想到十字架是 所背負重擔 的象徵。 對於一個 一 世紀的人來說，十字架意味著一件事 且只有一件事： 人類 可以發明的 最痛苦和最丟人的 死亡方式 。  \n  \n兩千年後，基督徒將十字架視為贖罪、 饒恕 、恩典和愛的象徵。 但在耶穌的 時代 裡，十字架代表的 只有 痛苦的死亡。 因為羅馬人 強制 被定罪的罪犯將自己的十字架 背 到受難地，背十字架意味著他們 背著自己的刑具同時要面對死亡道路上的嘲笑。  \n  \n因此，\" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我\"意味著 為了 跟隨耶穌願意 去 死 。 這叫做\" 向自己死 \"。 這是對絕對 順服的呼召 。 耶穌囑咐 背起十架之後， 他說 ： \"因為凡要救自己生命的 ， 必喪掉生命 ； 凡為我喪掉生命的 ， 必救了生命。人若賺得全世界 ， 卻喪了自己 ， 賠上自己 ， 有什麼益處呢？ \" ( 路加福音 9:24-25; 馬太福音 16:26; 馬可福音 8:35-36) 。 儘管這 個呼召 很困難，但 回報 卻是無與倫比的。  \n  \n無論耶穌去哪裡，他都吸引眾人。 儘管這些人常常 將他 作為彌賽亞 來 跟隨他， 但是 他們對彌賽亞真正的看法——他將會做什麼 —— 被 扭曲了。 他們認為基督 會開闢復興的國度。 他們 認為 他會把他們從羅馬占領者的壓迫 中 解放出來。 甚至基督自己門徒的內部圈子也認為這個王國即將來臨 ( 路加福音 19:11) 。 當耶穌開始教導他將死於猶太領袖和非猶太人 的君主 ( 路加福音9:22) 時，他的聲望就下降了。 許多被震驚的 跟 隨者都拒絕了他。 的確，他們不能 消滅 自己的想法、計劃和願望 ， 而用耶穌的來代替。  \n  \n當生活順利的時候，跟隨耶穌是很容易的 ； 我們對他的真正承諾是在 試煉 過程中顯露出來的。 耶穌向我們 明確，試煉 將會臨到他的 跟 隨者 ( 約翰福音 16:33) 。 門徒需要犧牲， 並且 耶穌從來沒有隱瞞過 這一代價 。  \n  \n在路加福音 9:57-62 ，有三個人似乎願意跟隨耶穌。 當耶穌進一步追問他們時，他們的承諾充其量只是半心半意。 他們沒能計算出 跟隨他的代價 。 沒有人願意 背起 他的十字架，把自己的利益釘在十字架上。  \n  \n因此，耶穌似乎勸阻了他們。 這是多麼 不同於典型的福音 傳道！ 有多少人會對一個叫做\" 來 跟隨耶穌，你可能會 面臨 失去朋友 、 家人 、 名聲、 事業，甚至是你的生命\" 這樣 的 獻祭 做出回應呢？ 虛假轉變之人 的數量可能會減少。 這就是耶穌所說的\" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我。\"  \n  \n如果你想知道你是否準備好 背起 你的十字架，考慮以下問題 :  \n\"如果 它意味著 你 會 失去一些最親密的朋友，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著疏遠你的家 人 ，你願意 跟 隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著你的名譽受損，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著你 將 失去工作，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著失去你的生命 ， 你願意 跟 隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n  \n在世界的某些地方，這些後果是 事實 。 但請注意這些問題的措辭，\"你願意嗎？ \"跟隨耶穌並不一定意味著所有這些事情都會發生在你身上，但是你願意 背起 你的十字架嗎？ 如果在你的生活中，你 將 面臨著一個選擇——耶穌或 今生 的舒適——你會選擇哪一個？  \n  \n對基督承諾意味著每天 背起 你的十字架，放棄你的希望 、 夢想 、 財產，為了基督的緣故如果需要的話 ， 甚至是你的生命。 只有當你願意 背起 你的十字架時，你才可以 稱為 他的門徒 ( 路加福音 14:27) 。 回報值得 這一代價 。 耶穌 緊跟他向自己死的呼召 ( \" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我\" ) 之後 ， 是 在基督裡 獲得 生命 ： \"凡 要 救自己生命的，必喪掉生命 ； 凡為我喪掉生命的，必 得著 生命\" ( 馬太福音 16:25) 。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E4%BA%8C%E9%9A%8E%E6%95%88%E7%94%A82nd-order-effect":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌱 \nlinks: [[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[Daniel Schmachtenberger Bend not Break Maximum Power \u0026 Hyper Agents  The Great Simplification]]\n[[Technology Is Not Values Neutral Ending the Reign of Nihilistic Design]]\n\n---\n在衡量一項措施或決策時，比較好的方式是要跨越最表層的一階效用（first order effect），思考二階、甚至三階效用。意思是說，我們不僅要考慮當前決定的後果，還要考慮到這些後果的後果。面對其他人做的決策，我們也應該設想他人在做出這些決策時可能蘊含了二階、三階思維，並企圖理解它。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E4%BA%BA%E6%80%A7%E7%9A%84%E5%96%84%E8%88%87%E6%83%A1":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[人性]]、[[政治]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\n[[個人德性的意義與責任]]\n[[個人德性受脈絡所定]]\n\n---\n人類作為理性的動物，我們既能向善、亦可為惡。沒有一個小孩不會欣喜振奮於自己能憑藉雙手去實現的良善和積極性；即便只是幫父母擺碗筷或學會綁自己的鞋帶，那都是微小但無庸置疑的「德行」。但人類也有能力鑄下遠遠沒有任何動物能夠複製的邪惡，無論是源自先天組成、心理創傷、意識形態，或是偶像崇拜、群眾心理、部落主義，都足以導致各種不堪入目的個人或集體的極端邪惡 [1][2][3]。\n\n縱然我們活在安逸舒適的二十一世紀，也不代表我們理當自命清高地滑著手機、把過去一百年的眾多苦難看成我們可以遠遠拋在後頭的歷史軼事、彷彿那些殘酷邪惡盡是一些本質上跟你我截然不同的次等人類所造成的。事實上正巧相反，我們有好理由相信自己和那些巨大邪惡之間相距不遠 [4][5]：你會以為自己是個「好人」，比較有可能是因為你沒有剛好落入那些能輕易使你作惡的情境裡，而不是因為你比那些「壞蛋」高人一等。畢竟，要在你我自己身上找到貪嗔癡慢疑的證據，想必不會太難才對。\n\n無論納粹或共產主義，二十世紀都已經留給我們一個沉痛的歷史教訓：當人類受到盲目熱情、偶像崇拜、部落主義、意識形態所驅使時，我們便可能為其他人類帶來巨大的苦難、實現令人驚懼的惡。這些駭人聽聞的邪惡，都在在提醒著我們永遠不該對人性抱持浪漫的無知，低估任何人——包含你我自己——為惡的可能性，甚至忽略群眾心理和情境條件等足以將好人輕易變成劊子手的非理性因素。凡是為人，都可能在某些不幸的處境下棄善行惡。\n\n但這是否代表我們可以斷然為人類的存在做下結論，相信人類是輕易受到環境制約、被群眾心理支配、樂於追隨熱情而摒棄理性、僅僅是比較聰明卻也製造無數禍害的靈長類呢？我不認為，因為正如Viktor Frankl在《活出意義來》中說的：\n\n\u003e（在納粹集中營裡）光知道一個人究竟是警衛或俘虜，顯然不能據以瞭解此人的性格。人類的同情心，在任何一群人當中皆可發現……善惡的分界線，竟劃過了天下眾生、直抵人性的最深層；即連在集中營中所揭露的深淵底層，亦如此清晰可辨，寧不令人慨歎嗎？\n\n人類在無數劫難中不斷前進、建立更加穩固而安康的社會，我們能走到二十一世紀的今天，本身已是個了不起的成就。今天的人類世界，享有過往的人們遠遠難以想像的安康、富裕、便利、還有生活的可能性，就連此時此刻世界上最貧困的國家，都已經遠離幾百年前人類世界中最糟糕的處境。即便跟許多人受到新聞和社群媒體毒害的世界觀相互抵觸，但其實有大量證據告訴我們這個世界正在變得更好 [6][7][8]。\n\n雖然此刻的人類的確握有前所未有的強大力量、足以帶著整個世界共赴滅亡，更面臨著前所未有的科技、人文、政治、心理的嶄新挑戰，但那並不代表我們該對二十一世紀抱持著悲觀的末日觀點。相反地，當我們深刻地瞭解人類作為一種動物，你我內心深處能夠累積多麼龐大的憤怒、憎恨、傷害他人的意圖；認識到人性的黑暗能引領我們為這個世界創造多少的苦難；並從人類剛在過去一百年內鑄下的種種邪惡去深省……\n\n如果你瞭解自己身而為人能夠承載多大的邪惡，你該接著發現的是，我們睜眼所見的世界卻是充斥了如此多的良善。這簡直就是奇蹟。\n\n當你看見自己此刻身處的世界竟能用如此有效、互信、甚至充滿善意的方式流暢運作，當你每一天醒來這個社會都跟昨天一樣國泰民安、老百姓們一樣為生活踏實努力著，你該明白原來這一切如此得來不易、你該感謝人類整體費了多大的努力才走到今天、你該慶幸自己生在如此幸運的時代，並且謹記歷史的教訓。\n\n人性的潛在之惡，只更凸顯了人心向善的趨力——當這個世界、社會、人與人之間能以和平共榮的方式運作時，幾乎沒有人會拒絕以同樣良善、互惠、有尊嚴的方式投身其中。\n\n更重要的是，我們應該看見自己在這一切當中，如何承擔了同樣舉足輕重的責任。\n\n\n---\n\n註\n\n1.

It humbles us because its a manifestation of God's good that is stored in every living thing as potential, and the vision of this giant tree truly \"calls out\" to our inner potential for the highest good.\n\nPotential can only be fully fulfilled by freedom, and that's why freedom and individual sovereignty are the most fundamental values for a human society.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E4%BD%BF%E7%8A%A7%E7%89%B2%E6%88%90%E7%82%BA%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[社會]]、[[科技]]、[[貨幣]]、[[金融]]、[[政治]]、[[道德]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[關心「跨期」的道德實踐]]\n[[科技是形塑人類歷史的無形力量]]\n[[個人德性受脈絡所定]]\n\n---\n在之前的文章中，我引用過羅徹斯特大學腦與神經科學部門的助理教授Celeste Kidd所做的「棉花糖實驗」。\n\n\u003e她把一組孩子放在「可靠的」情境下，另一組則置於「不可靠的」情境下。在棉花糖實驗正式登場之前，不可靠的情境下那組孩子會遇到一個不守信用的成人。舉例來說，在上美術課時，成人向孩子保證如果乖乖等一下，他就會拿新的美術用品給她，替換她現有的那盒不堪用的蠟筆。過了幾分鐘，他空手而回。另一方面，可靠組的孩子會遇到信守諾言帶來新蠟筆的成人。\n\n\u003e 可靠情境的孩子表現得和先前棉花糖研究中的孩子差不多，僅有少數幾個孩子很快向誘惑投降，約三分之二的孩子願意等待。不可靠情境的孩子就不一樣了。成人離開以後，有半數的孩子在一分鐘之內就吃掉棉花糖，只有一個孩子撐得夠久而領到第二顆棉花糖。\n\nKidd的發現顯示了，孩子在擁有信任感、相信成人會信守諾言的情境裡，展現較低的「時間偏好 (Time Preference)」、願意推遲眼前甜頭、更具備耐心的德性。\n\n（「時間偏好」意指人們對於短期及長期利益的計算衡量，亦即「及時行樂」與「延遲享樂」間的拔河：時間偏好高，代表人比較短視近利、今朝有酒今朝醉、樂意消費當下可得的好處；時間偏好低，代表人比較思慮長遠、著重未來的收成、能夠推遲眼前的利益。）\n\n同理適用更廣的社會層面上：唯有當人們對於犧牲行為具備信念、相信自己身處在「可靠的」大環境下，才可能降低時間偏好，能思慮未來、關心群體、體現美德。相反地，當維繫這份信念的固有機制（可能是價值觀、科技產品、社會制度等）遭到新發明或觀念的破壞、走向崩壞，人們便可能不再對犧牲行為抱持信念，讓一整代人都更短視更自私，進一步削弱群體中的信任。\n\n於是我們應該認知到，**特定科技或社會機制的發明，能夠大大地促進人們為群體福祉進行跨期的思考**——亦即成為更有遠見與德性的個人——無論作法是刺激人的理性和良知、或者單純讓人們發現這是賽局中的較佳策略。\n\n以下是一些我們清晰可見的實例：\n\n- 貨幣：一種跨越時間空間、以「信任」為核心的價值載體。人們將投入生產或服務的能量（勞力、技術、能源等），透過交易「轉存」進貨幣中，並信任貨幣裡「存取」的能量/價值在另一個時間空間中仍能幾乎等值地兌現成其他產品或服務。\n  \n  當人們信任手上的錢在不同時空中能保持其價值，相信延遲享樂、犧牲當下利益可以換取未來的更好報酬，儲蓄才可能成為合理的理財途徑，刺激人們為長遠、群體的利益思考，企業亦有更高動機去創新、解決未來問題。反之，當人們預期金錢價值在未來可能不增反減，等同變相鼓勵人們趁能花掉時先花掉，形成以消費、借貸、債務為核心的經濟模式（預支未來以成全當下享受，可謂「犧牲」的對立概念），企業也因此被鼓勵提供最能滿足人們當前胃口的淺碟產品與服務。[1]\n\n- 金融：即是人與人的「跨期承諾」，是今天跟未來的價值交換。無論古今，人都會面臨天災人禍的威脅，所以會有透過跟他人做跨期交換的避險需求。一旦涉及跨期承諾，信任就是核心，否則當違約賴帳的機率太高，就不會再有人願意參與跨期價值交換。貨幣是人類最早、最基本、最普遍的金融品項，但借貸、股票、保險、債券等其他方案也都要求著同等抑或更高的信任，方能使「投資」成為可能。[2]\n\n- 法治：談到跨期承諾的兌現，就必須探討如何解決違約賴帳的問題。法律是人類文明賴以維護權益、約定義務的規則體系，使人們對於彼此之間可以和不可以做什麼事情保有清晰的理解，並信任同一套規則也被其他人所採納，違法犯紀的人則會受到相應的懲戒。法治社會為人們帶來一視同仁的約束、使人類行為能有公正的可預期性、進而為人與人之間的跨期承諾帶來保障、也就讓各種犧牲行為有了兌現的可能。金融與法治的相輔相成，讓禮俗宗教等過去被社會長期採用的遊戲規則得以退居次位。\n\n由更廣的層面看，你我生活中許多帶有「犧牲」意含的活動，也都是立基在科技及社會機制所成就的安穩生活條件上。舉例來說，我們投入運動保健的努力，是以當下努力換取未來的長遠安康、或至少降低不必要的風險；我們將教育視為對自己的投資，相信投注時間心力去研習某些專業知識，對於未來發展會有幫助；在道德上，我們大多相信、或多少都用行動驗證了當個正直誠實的「好人」是個好策略，就算有時會不太方便，長期來說也通常對自己、對別人都有比較好的結果。\n\n值得一提的是，在政治學理論中，人們對未來的規劃越長遠，就越會參與政治與支持民主([Mill, 1861](http://www.constitution.org/jsm/rep_gov.htm); [Fowler and Kam, 2006](http://fowler.ucsd.edu/patience_and_turnout.pdf))，因為參與政治的付出是立即的，但是經過長久協商、妥協後的政策產出往往很久以後才會發生，可是也惟有長久的協商創造出的公共領域可以有效的反映民意、監督政府而防止濫權，也因此**耐心**被視為是一種政治德性 (political virtue)，有益民主政治。[3]\n\n由此可見，特定發明所帶來的生活條件，賦予了我們能夠進行跨期道德思考、使「犧牲」成為可能的環境，而人們在這樣的基礎上持續創新、改良、提升生活品質、擴大關心的範圍、推進文明的發展——**科技發展和社會機制對於人們的時間偏好有著直接的影響。**\n\n理解這點，就能理解為什麼國勢衰微會使禮樂崩壞，經濟委靡會讓人民懷念起威權政治，通膨破表會令年輕人失去未來展望。\n\n---\n註：\n1.

But these are all inadequate, because the infinite abyss can only be filled by an infinite and immutable Object, that is to say, only by God Himself.\n\n最近十年來，全球政治的空前紛亂、部落主義的推陳出新、社群媒體的火上加油，都在在顯示了現代人在疏離傳統與宗教後，迫切地需要一個全新的生命託付。帶給人們生活意義的核心事物，從過去的道德、責任、家庭、社群，演變成今日的娛樂、政治、社運、投資、以及其他五花八門的東西。\n\n當然，現代的生命託付絕非只是膚淺和無益的，我也不是主張人們的託付只能是傳統或宗教。然而值得我們謹記的是，當一個人擁有、享受、經歷得再多，內心深處卻仍未獲平靜時，那往往便是缺乏「信仰」的警訊。縱然現代人盡享當代社會的美好安逸，但生命終究是充滿缺憾與不如意的，若我們任由自己停留在「意義真空」中、缺乏對任何核心價值的信仰，我們將難以消受種種生命的考驗。\n\n事實是，人生中能賦予我們最豐富的意義和正面情緒的活動（或之一），便是我們為自己立下一個值得追尋的志向、一步步地朝著標的邁進。許多時候，有沒有抵達終點根本沒有這麼重要。這裡我說的「志向」，不僅僅是一個人在現實層面想要的成就或想望，更多是他內心深處的「心志所向」：他期許如何評價他自己、期許在重要他人眼中成為什麼樣貌的自己、期許自己能做得到或能為社會做到什麼。\n\n而這些深刻的自我追尋，都必須由一個人信仰的核心價值所驅使，足見「信仰」作為生命的基本態度，是通往一個具備絕對意義的人生的起點。\n\n\u003e人活著不能沒有信仰。我們這一代以及後代的關鍵問題在於：這個信仰究竟會成為對領袖、機械、成功的非理性信仰，或者是基於我們自身創造性活動所產生的理性信仰。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E5%BE%B7%E6%80%A7%E5%8F%97%E8%84%88%E7%B5%A1%E6%89%80%E5%AE%9A":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \naliases: 棉花糖實驗、本質主義\nlinks: [[道德]]、[[信任]]、[[倫理學]]、[[時間偏好]]、[[人性]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref:\n\n---\n談到延遲享樂，大概讓許多人想起知名的「[棉花糖實驗](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A3%89%E8%8A%B1%E7%B3%96%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C)」、以及它如何證明了自制力和個人成就的關連性。但不同於多數人的理解，自制力作為個人特質，其實與一個人身處的情境或脈絡息息相關。換句話說，自制力——一如其他的個人特質與德性——在你我身上絕非只是訴諸命定、「有或沒有」的是非題。\n\n無論是否有意識到這點，多數人都傾向相信性格和道德是與生俱來、難以改變的。當鄰居小孩被逮到順手牽羊偷了便利商店的糖果，我們會直覺地認定他的道德有瑕疵，並從此對他產生戒心、相信他還會再偷別的東西。同樣的觀點讓我們把非常高、甚至不符現實的道德標準套用在名人或政治人物身上，相信如果一個人在私生活的特定面向上不正直，他就肯定是個全盤道德淪喪的人，不容許模糊地帶。更不用說「可是我的個性就是這樣」就是個許多人為了逃避改變和現實、善於灌輸自己的自我限制信念 (Self-Limiting Belief)。\n\n將個人特質和德性視為非黑即白的是非題，即是所謂「本質主義」的人性觀。\n\n本質主義在人性詮釋上的錯誤，在於它沒把一個人所處的情境和脈絡列入考量。一九二零年代，一個針對八千名學童個性的大規模調查[1]，指出多數人在道德上都展現了極低的一致性：有個女生在改自己的考卷時動了手腳，可是在負責派對遊戲的記分工作時卻很公正；有個男生考試時作弊，偷抄另一個同學的答案，可是他在改自己的考卷時卻沒使詐；有個孩子在家偷錢，在學校卻不偷。\n\n這顯示了像正直、仁愛、合作、拘謹、固執等個性，往往都是一個人在特定情境下的固定習性，但非普遍特質。在不同情境下，一個人展現的品格與德性仍可能是截然不同的，而這也對於一個「好人」為什麼可能成為惡魔[2]——比如納粹集中營裡向人施暴的獄卒——提供了完善的解釋。\n\n自制力也是相同的故事。在棉花糖實驗點出了「願意等十五分鐘得到第二顆棉花糖的孩子，未來的現實成就普遍較高」這個本質主義式的關鍵論點後，便有神經科學家著手研究大腦中與自制力相關的結構及如何影響它、兒童心理學家開發課程讓家長用以增進兒女的自制力、教育專家熱切地提出能激發自制力的品格教育方案、社會大眾則危言聳聽著彼此的孩子可能正承擔失敗人生的風險。\n\n然而，現任羅徹斯特大學腦與神經科學部門的助理教授Celeste Kidd，在進行了她自己的棉花糖實驗後，得到了與本質主義論點徹底相反的結果：\n\n\u003e 她把一組孩子放在「可靠的」情境下，另一組則置於「不可靠的」情境下。在棉花糖實驗正式登場之前，不可靠的情境下那組孩子會遇到一個不守信用的成人。舉例來說，在上美術課時，成人向孩子保證如果乖乖等一下，他就會拿新的美術用品給她，替換她現有的那盒不堪用的蠟筆。過了幾分鐘，他空手而回。另一方面，可靠組的孩子會遇到信守諾言帶來新蠟筆的成人。\n\n\u003e 可靠情境的孩子表現得和先前棉花糖研究中的孩子差不多，僅有少數幾個孩子很快向誘惑投降，約三分之二的孩子願意等待。不可靠情境的孩子就不一樣了。成人離開以後，有半數的孩子在一分鐘之內就吃掉棉花糖，只有一個孩子撐得夠久而領到第二顆棉花糖。[3]\n\n實驗顯示了，在擁有信任感的環境裡，孩子會顯露出比無法信任他人的孩子更高的自制力。Kidd的結論是，自制力雖然看似個人的基本特質，但其實仍受脈絡所定。\n\n事實上，假如我們關心相關的數據，會發現類似的例子在我們日常生活中隨處可見：在排隊買咖啡時打手機簡訊，會讓你不小心點了熱量比較高的摩卡奶昔；一整天沒吸菸的癮君子，狂吃冰淇淋的機率卻大增；光是「考慮」捐錢給慈善機構，就會提高人們上街購物犒賞自己的欲望[4]——這些例證，都在在顯示了我們的「自制力」幾乎總是被情境和脈絡所牽制，許多時候我們根本無法「靠自己」做出正確的抉擇。\n\n---\n註\n\n1.

如果你的次序與他人的次序無法對齊，便會產生衝突、嫌隙、焦慮、自我懷疑；當你的次序與他人的次序相似或一致，便能夠為他人創造價值、為自己創造意義，並**在混沌中建立秩序**。人類是社會的動物、總是尋求與他人的連結，故根本不存在所謂的「不被任何人理解也沒關係」的生命意義——那應該要叫生命意義的失落。\n\n所以，**承認道德的重要，就是承認人需要一套可以倚賴的言行準則，就是承認秩序之於生命意義的必要性，更是承認存在著某種值得人努力達到、而且每個人都有能力一步步靠近的生命理想。** \n\n當你能夠謙卑地、日復一日地努力省思並修正自己的言行，你必將看見自己龐大的道德潛能，甚至在某些時刻逼近自己理想中的自我。當你每天努力彌補自己的道德缺陷、盡力為身邊他人帶來更多的安康（或至少不要帶來不必要的苦難），你就不可能認為人類是這個星球上的寄生蟲、將社會問題一股腦地歸咎於權力結構、認為唯有政府有所作為才能讓事情變得更好。\n\n相反地，你會發現只要秉持品格，即便過著極其平凡的生活也能深具意義。你更將相信人類確實有潛力成為真正善良、同理、勇敢、有智慧的物種。你會承擔起讓世界變得更好的責任，並透過為你周遭的人們成為最好的自己，來盡自己的一份力。\n\n**一個人對自己生命的道德意義及責任的態度，將根本性地決定他對全人類的態度。**","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC%E9%9A%8E%E7%B4%9A":{"title":"","content":"tags:

(Value Hierarchy)」——在每一個當下，判斷哪些事物優先於其他。\n\n\n如果將時間軸拉遠，人類作為一種「目的性的存在」更是不證自明：人會想要讓自己的價值被看見、會想要相信自己是被需要的、會想要知道自己活著的意義為何。也因此，當一個人遭逢意外（比方說感情破裂、工作失利、肢體損傷等），導致長期信奉的信念受到質疑、或生存目的遭到剝奪時，他自然會出現「認同危機 (Identity

Price of Energy\n- We never pay the price for energy, since our adoption of the classical/neo-classical economy theory (in which we price everything somewhere between its use value and manufacturing value).\n- In our current capitalist economic system, we are taxed according to our income, which has to do with our labor and skill. That, in turn, puts the emphasis on each person's ability, skill, and 'marketable' traits.\n- A better system that encourage and make easy people's virtue, which by definition will need to lower people's time preference, will be taxing people not by their income, but their consumption. The consumption of the goods that take more energy to produce, will be taxed more heavily to reflect the diminishing natural resource. \n- By taxing according to energy consumption, essentially encourages lower energy consumption and more moderate way of living. Human desires will not be eliminated because we will always have desires, but people will be encouraged to put their emphasis on things that come free in life, such as family, friendship, love.\n- Combining this with the fixed-quantity sound money, we'll have a much smaller economy that does not enslave people for infinite consumption and economic growth, but one that is driven by human passion, virtue, and innovation.\n  Ref: [[PBD Podcast  EP 128  Patron Saint of Bitcoin Michael Saylor]]\n  \n- **However, I'll still have to ponder on whether this 'resource-constrained' economy (unlike the current 'demand-driven' model) will end up being just like the soviet union, where no actual innovation happens, or will it become a better world for people where we're no longer enslaved by the capitalist hamster wheel and instead focus on the real worth-while things in life and see innovations that actually make people's lives better (not just pure entertainment).**\n  \n\n# Fossil Fuel\n\n- **Fossil fuel is the ultimate 'free lunch'** human will likely ever get.\n  **Fossil fuel** is the most '**pro-human**' energy - it's cheap, reliable, and uniquely superior at raising billions of people out of poverty.\n- Environmental activists are essentially supporting the policy to save the future generation by leaving billions of people today suffer.

People exaggerate its danger, and refuse to see why 'responsibly containing the waste of our own electricity production' is a fair and proper act.

Free market can slant toward rivalry thinking and push people into war. Once a country owns weapon, everyone will be forced to catch up. Once one person is cheating and exploiting the environment to get ahead, it’s no longer ethical to quit the game but to join it in order to maybe in a very scarce hope fix it. Limited resources still leads to zero sum game. One’s short-term benefit can be damaging to the collective’s long-term benefit. \n\nA new social and technological reinvention might be needed to get our hardware and software work together to achieve a more peaceful and thriving world.\n\nHardware: Ebay, Uber, Airbnb, Agoda...Encourage and reward the honesty, trust and good behaviors in people. It also make resources more sharable and not owned by any particular being. Digital technology also makes these things possible and greatly increase the capacity of every bit of resource. This leads to a more honest, trusting, abundant realm of reality that people can thrive in. This will eventually decentralize power from the governmener and force the governments to focus on providing basic services and protecting the country, instead of buying their way to power by waiving benefits at people.\n\nSoftware: A basic level of trust, earnestness, and empathy has to be instilled in the individuals in order for the system to work. Buddhism and some similar social technologies (Confucionism) succeed in augmenting people’s sence of empathy and allow them to expand their circle of good will over the 150 people tribe.

Notes:\n\n儒家的個人神聖性：「人能弘道，非道弘人」、「人性向善」。政治上對個人道德的著重，一切使於個人道德的提升。盡善己身，以善天下；個人道德是政治參與的起點。\n\nWhere it goes

墮胎問題在臺灣與美國的對比）。法律無須作為人的行為底線，因情感、公理更先於法。\n\n援引道家：\n道家可謂最早的自由意志主義者，主張小政府、無為而治、降低干預，使自然、社會、人民、市場，接能自主調節、平衡、由下而上地產生秩序。\n\n---\n\n儒家之最高為政境界為「無為而治」，而非全面干預（中國共產黨式的父母官思維，或兩蔣時代的遺風）。\n\n\t（《論語衛靈公》，無為而治，其舜也與。\n\t\n\t道、無、有。無，又名始；母，又名母。據此，“無”字就被賦予雙重意義，一是帶有根本性即尊循發展機制、法則和規律的意義，二是不干涉人民的自由，讓其充分發揮所能作用的意義。\n\t\n\t在老子這裡，無為之意是具有兩重意思的。老子勸說在上層的治人治事者要無為，就是說只做根本性和基礎性的工作，讓人民擁有充分發揮其有為作用的條件和空間。生態世界是發展和治理最成功的典範，在上層的治人治事者若想取得成功，應道法自然顯而易見，無為而治需要治者無我，利他，“上善若水，水善利萬物而不爭，處眾人之所惡。）\n\n君主制之所以可能比代議民主更為可行，原因有二：時間偏好，及動機問題。\n四年一次的選舉，致使現代民主僅著眼當前、四年內之成績，而未能為更長遠未來規劃。\n相對地，運行穩定的君主制，應以德性及小政府為核心運作，並因為君主世襲，其時間偏好能與人民一致，做更長遠考量。\n儒者之政治的最高境界為「無為而治」之所以能「為無為」，正如孫子兵法所述，是因其透過「德政」建立「勢」。以仁德治國，可謂一種低時間偏好的政治形式，亦與世襲的君主制相呼應。\n*儒家以德治國＞天下歸順=低時間偏好的迂迴投資／勢之建立＞能為未來世代思慮之君主制＞以德性為核心的小政府「無為而治」*\n\n\n德性＝為當下＆跨期之個人＆群體考慮，盡力創造安康\n德政＝為人民建立更易於培養德性之條件／環境＝激發人性向善之趨力（不是強迫眾人為善）＝非以力服人\u0026追求短期成效的政治＝君主不藉「力」，而藉低時間偏好的仁政，以建立「勢」\n＝如戰國時代所示，德政乃是政治中的「迂迴投資」＝德政所產生的「勢」，能使天下歸順，君主方能倚賴民意得以傳位，而非以「力」保住權勢\n＝此「勢」得使仁君「無為而治」、達到儒家參政至最高點＆道家精神之核心\n因此在現代社會中：德性＝迂迴＝勢／道＝為無為（亦可解釋為善惡因果之運作）\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%84%92%E5%AE%B6%E8%AB%96%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E9%81%93%E5%BE%B7%E6%BD%9B%E8%83%BD":{"title":"","content":"tags:

今人乍見孺子將入於井，皆有怵惕惻隱之心。非所以內交於孺子之父母也，非所以要譽於鄉黨朋友也，非惡其聲而然也。由是觀之，無惻隱之心，非人也；無羞惡之心，非人也；無辭讓之心，非人也；無是非之心，非人也。\n\n\u003e 惻隱之心，仁之端也；羞惡之心，義之端也；辭讓之心，禮之端也；是非之心，智之端也。人之有是四端也，猶其有四體也。有是四端而自謂不能者，自賊者也；謂其君不能者，賊其君者也。凡有四端於我者，知皆擴而充之矣，若火之始然，泉之始達。\n\n看見一個小孩要跌進井裡去，任何人都會有驚駭同情的心情，孟子稱之為「惻隱之心」。此心震動，並非基於任何利益考慮（例如希望攀結那小孩的父母、博取鄉里朋友的讚譽，或因為討厭那小孩的哭聲），而是真心不忍他人無故受苦。孟子於是舉出「惻隱之心」等四端，說明人性之中本來就具備無條件關懷他人的道德潛能及傾向，也是其「性善論」的基礎。\n\n---\n或許有人會說，即使人有道德的潛能，也不意味我們就有責任要發揮它，何況人格的理想是幾乎不可能被達成的。雖然我認為這只是個悖於常理的詭辯，但讓我們從正反兩面討論人在道德實踐上的這份責任。\n\n從反面切入，我們可以參考孟子的說法：「人之所以異於禽獸者，幾希，庶民去之，君子存之。」這是說人與禽獸之間的差異就這麼一點點——這一點點正是我們具備的道德之心。若我們背離了道德追求、放棄了道德潛能的實踐，我們就稱不上是人，而與禽獸無異了。對儒家而言，堅守這條人類自我形象的底線，是不證自明的公理。\n\n從正面思考，我會重申這點：在我們企望著意義的生命中，不容忽視的是你我所秉持的理想、以及我們為達至理想所採取的行動。講白話點，如果你心中沒有一個值得前進的理想——理想的自我、或者身處在理想的人生風景中的自己（亦即另一種形式的理想自我）——並且為之付出像樣的努力，那麼要看見自己活著的意義，肯定會是個難題。\n\n正因為你我生來都帶著這份道德潛能、而德性作為理想卻是幾乎不可能被迄及的，這個在「潛能」與「理想」間的遙遠距離，反而更凸顯了追求德性的崇高與深刻，以及人類在這條漫長路途上的無限可能。就跟長跑——[這個專屬人類的運動方式](https://www.natgeomedia.com/environment/article/content-1823.html)——一樣，人類從沒有達到一個特定里程而從此開心佇足不再前進，反倒鍥而不捨地探索更遠的距離、更艱困的路途、更看似不可能的目標，而長跑的意義也正是由此彰顯。同樣地，既然人人皆有道德的潛能與傾向，那麼在道德上的追求和實踐就必定是為你我生命帶來豐富意義的重要旅程，無論我們此生能否看見終點。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%85%88%E6%B1%82%E5%AE%88%E6%88%90%E5%86%8D%E6%B1%82%E6%94%B9%E9%80%B2":{"title":"","content":"tags:

檢討秩序的起點\n\n**價值階級，就是辨認某些事物比其他事物更重要。一個社會要能建立秩序，需要大部分的成員都同意一套共同的價值階級，讓人們能夠為他們同樣重視的東西共同努力、避開不夠重要的活動、甚至懲罰那些有違公同價值的行為。**\n\n然而歷史告訴我們，社會的尺規並非總是理想美好的東西，許多時候它更是個不得不將人類靈魂削足適履的生硬規範。我們都知道秩序有可能替暴君背書、長久傳承的價值也可能迫害個人。\n\n因此，當我們相信當前的社會隱含某種系統性的問題，應該考慮以下幾種情形：\n\n第一，這個價值階級裡視為優先的東西有部分是錯的、或不合時宜的，需要汰換成新的、更符合當代生活與群體共識的項目。\n\n第二，這個價值階級有可能流於理想、缺乏現實條件支持，所以無法在當前社會的現實條件下有效運作、或即使運作了也無法帶來它宣稱的成果，僅能讓人們過著差強人意的生活。\n\n第三，這個價值階級的宣稱不乏實用性和實際成果，但因為時代演進，人們未能看清其價值、持續遵循、樂於將當前穩定視為理所當然，所以在引領群體的效用上漸顯乏力，這是價值階級在運行上出現了瑕疵，但並不代表價值階級本身是錯的。\n\n當我們嘗試檢討社會的秩序時，應當留心自己真正的動機、辨明自己的主張是哪一種，而不該囫圇吞棗地認定社會的問題是上述三者加總、草率做出「當前的社會秩序有其危害、故值得摒棄」的結論，甚至沒能夠提出繼續引領群體的替代方案。\n\n許多前衛開放的理想份子經常犯下的錯，正是一股腦地反動、想要揚棄傳統與秩序，卻沒看到自己腳下踩著的正是文化長河走過千百年所積累出的深厚土壤；如果真的將社會共同遵循的價值與秩序拋出腦後，你我生活中的一切「已知」都勢必將墮入混沌。流於意識形態、缺乏真知灼見的革命，更多只有啟動混亂的效用，而無法為社會注入新的、更有效引領群體前進的秩序。\n\n任何形式的革命都不是廉價的、讓大家喊起來自我感覺良好的東西，它背負著某種對現況的深度檢討與沉痛省思、最終仍不得不為的領悟，更得肩負著扛下一切後果的責任感。它不會、也不該只是某些人企圖卸除加諸在自己身上的制約或責任、所以提出要其他人有所改變的要求。\n\n一個人的道德實踐，不但是個人生命意義的來源，也是社會秩序的基石。在我們批判社會秩序如何壓迫個人、值得鄙棄之前，都該先問問自己是否行得正、坐得直，或者只是想透過批判「社會」這個看不見的敵人來博取免費的道德點數。\n\n在這個認知之上，我們便可以回過頭檢視社會秩序如何失調、對個人造成傷害。\n\n一間公司有可能在規模變大後出現腐敗的文化，人們開始玩政治、酬庸、搞小手段來晉升。在這種時候，有些人顯然不再秉持著跟公司本身相同的價值、秩序不再正確地運作、群體沒有以同一套價值階級去合作。微小的貪腐行徑若未被他人及時指出糾正，便會帶著公司一點一滴走向衰敗。全球500大企業名單大多無法在榜上連續待超過三十年、大部分成功的家族企業也很難生存超過三個世代，顯示了要維繫一個組織長期的有效合作、穩定運作是如此地艱難，更遑論要它與時俱進、進步創新。（更多精闢的分析在福山的《信任》多有著墨。）\n\n企業可能因文化腐敗而聘僱或晉升錯誤的人選、家庭可能因缺乏自省而以傳統價值去傷害個人自由、你我亦可能一時盲目而錯把另有所圖的人當成盟友，但這些都沒有消減秩序之於人類群體的重要性。相反地，這顯示了為什麼我們不僅必須充分認知到秩序的運作、時時審視著當下身處的組織是圍繞著什麼價值而生，更要慎重地面對關於人的各種決定、積極地捍衛價值的矗立、並適時做出調整與更正。所以我們在商管領域總能聽到關於企業文化的討論，也是為什麼當家裡長輩相繼過世時，我們能從後輩們接下來的互動中清楚觀察到家庭價值的彰顯或失落。\n\n---\n**唯有當我們釐清秩序、傳統、規範背後的原則，才能對之進行像樣的檢討。**

僅僅因為我們搞清楚某個措施的一項功能，並不意味著我們已經搞清楚它的所有功能。\n\n柵欄不會從地底長出來，也不會是人們吃飽撐著跑去蓋的；它必定是有人基於特定原因建造的，就算是不合邏輯或無關緊要的原因，也仍然是原因。企圖移除柵欄的改革者，便有責任搞清楚建造這些柵欄的原因是什麽，否則任何自以為是的唐突改變都有可能讓事情變得更糟。\n\n許多現代人好於質疑任何形式的既有秩序、嚷著社會是個大牢籠、抗議長輩的要求和信念都只是家父長制的迂腐陋習；他們草率地推翻那些過去運作良好的事物，只為了支持新的、但沒有證據顯示能長久矗立的措施。這種批評更多是想替自己貼上知識份子標籤的表面功夫、誤把犬儒主義當成了事物的合理解釋。然而如果他們全面性地思考打破秩序後的社會應該如何運行，他們會發現自己並沒有像樣的替代品。\n\n更進一步來說，切斯特頓的柵欄告誡我們，當我們企圖干預他人建立起的系統或措施時，最好假設前人考慮了某些我們尚未了解的事情、或者有我們無法理解的經歷，所以我們不應躁進地尋求快速解法，因為這可能反讓情況變糟。\n\n切斯特頓的柵欄不是要勸退任何企圖改善現況的人，但它是一個重要的呼籲：在干預現狀前，先理解背後的思維。我們並不總是比那些在我們之前做出決定的人更清楚狀況；唯有深刻地同理前人的經歷及其面對的挑戰，我們才會更洞悉全局、看清當前措施的細微之處。除非我們知道為什麽有人做出這樣的決定，否則我們無法安全地改善它、或斷定他們做錯了。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%88%A5%E4%BD%8E%E4%BC%B0%E4%BD%A0%E4%BB%8A%E5%A4%A9%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%81%9A%E5%B0%8D%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n[[由自己組成的「跨期」社群]]\n[[關心「跨期」的道德實踐]]\n[[個人德性受脈絡所定]]\n\n---\n我們該思考「有意識地建立或參與能讓自身德性更可靠的情境」具體而言代表什麼。\n\n討論意志力的書籍經常建議我們要為自己打造一個容易養成良好習慣、能以最小阻力完成正確行動的環境：如果你想要瘦身，就把垃圾食物通通丟掉；如果你想戒掉手機成癮，就該買個Kitchen Safe當成你的「慾望控制箱」；如果你想要一大早就出門運動，或許可以考慮直接穿著運動套裝上床睡覺……諸如此類。\n\n這個道理在人生更深廣的各個面向也同樣值得信奉：你之所以該規律運動、健康生活，是為了讓你有更充沛的活力和意志去照顧你的家人，當他們越虛弱的時候你就越得強壯起來；你之所以從一開始就該跟那個有意與你調情的同事保持距離，是為了避免一步步踏入有一天你將難以抗拒偷情的險境；你之所以應該儘早養成儲蓄習慣、學習投資，是因為當你在財富上擁有越多主動權，你才會有餘裕去選擇你想讓家人過的生活，也才有能力去回應周遭他人的需求或致意。\n\n所以下一步，是羅列出所有我們能採取的有價值行動。當我們重新檢視生活中的每一個環節、將一切都盡可能化約到最小的單位，我們幾乎總是可以找到自己還能做得更好的地方，為生活中仍一片混亂的部分重建條理，將事物導向更美麗、更實用、或更有意義的方向。\n\n你可以嘗試用電腦文件或紙筆將這些想法寫下，包含在各種情境下你的行事原則和應做的事，那或許是七點半早起運動、這個月的飲食開始避開碳水化合物、每天至少跟另一半講一句表達感激的話、不再當工作上的濫好人並開始練習拒絕、甚至只是把你的書桌整理乾淨。\n\n在這個過程中，我們勢必得誠實、甚至謙卑地面對眼前的世界、他人、以及自己。我們眼前總是散落著凌亂的待解問題、被我們踢進沙發底下假裝不存在的潛在危機、或者因為我們自恃過高而不屑一顧的必要行動——或許你真的該每天空出十分鐘跟另一半好好談心、或花點時間整理好你的書桌，而非繼續自滿於自己目標的宏大、沒時間低下頭做這種「沒效益」的事情。\n\n從最微小的事物著手，第一是這使得行動和改變毫不費力、不用要求強大意志或寬裕時間才能做到，降低了行動的門檻；第二是這也讓我們沒有更多藉口延遲推託。我們眼前幾乎總有我們可以立即採取、將事物導往更好方向的作為，但我們往往太習慣為自己解套、總能想到為什麼「現在不方便」，即便內心深知自己早該有所作為。\n\n突如其來的巨大意外往往是來自微小傷害的積累：長年不改的菸癮，導致了突然的肺癌診斷；每天下班後對伴侶的不聞不問，導致了某一天發現原來對方早已出軌多年；有錢就花的消費習慣，導致了家人突然重病時的經濟困境。當你在個人生活或人際關係中一再地漠視那些積累已久的微小惡習或問題，它們有一天就會變成你無法掌控的巨獸，屆時，你也早已不再信任自己有能力戰勝它們。\n\n在光譜的另一端道理亦然：足球巨星的一夕爆紅源自十年來每天默默地苦練；YouTuber的成功源自一個接著一個不斷地產出高品質影音；警衛翻身百萬富翁，源自上班存錢、投資績優股並耐心等待數十年[4]。每一天，你也只需要比昨天的自己進步一點點——1%也好、0.1%也好——只要你每天都把一件事情做好，幾年下來的指數成長就會讓你成為完全不一樣的人，做得到別人完全無法想像的事。唯一的缺點是你不會有東西可以跟別人炫耀。\n\n很顯然，我們往往沒有體認到「今天如何生活」是件多麼重要且神聖的事情，經常是因為我們不夠看重自己[真正的價值](https://vocus.cc/@Emperors_Wolf/6136497efd897800019b4ac7)，不但低估了自己今天選擇怠惰苟且的後果，也低估了自己今天選擇積極勤奮的價值。\n\n每一天，我們都可以選擇至少做好一件微小的事情：你可以早起為伴侶準備早餐、可以在進公司的路上露出更多笑容、可以在會議上更勇敢地表達自己的見解、可以多跟某個你看不順眼的那個同事寒暄兩句、可以少抽一根菸、可以花一個小時把你的臥室整理好、可以用多一點時間聆聽伴侶描述他的一天、可以打一通電話回去慰問父母、可以抽出半個小時看那本你說要看完的書、可以在洗澡前做十個伏地挺身、可以在睡前多留一點時間來照顧自己的心靈。\n\n你會發現，在每一天的日常生活裡，你能做對的事情其實有太多太多，而今天的你只需要挑一件做到就夠了，你更可能發現，你根本有能力做到不止一件。當你今天為了自己或你愛的人完成一件你相信是正確的事，你會踏實感覺到你比昨天的自己又成長了一點點、萌生了多一分對自己的尊敬，這也是你努力使未來的自己更加可靠的重要一小步。\n\n每一個人每一天醒來都可以選擇要為這世界帶來更多的安康、抑或更多不必要的苦難，因此，我們沒有理由放任自我成為對自己、對他人來說都更不可靠、不值得信任、甚至帶來更多麻煩的人——有意識地建立或參與能讓自身德性更可靠的情境，實是個你我都背負的道德責任。\n\n一個人用來壯大自身的努力，應該朝著讓自己更具行善為仁的能力為目標，才可能在倉促人生中捉住那稍縱即逝的存在意義。而這些正確行為的積累，無論是否可能替我們免除生命中的苦難，它本身就是為將來的種種困境做好準備的唯一方式。\n\n當然，這並不是說我們永遠不能鬆掉發條、享受此刻。人生是一連串賽局的集合，有時候我們需要抓緊良機、乘勝追擊，有時候我們必須斷尾求生、留得青山，有時候我們該允許自己享受當下美好、勿留遺憾。然而我很確定的是，將你今天可以做對的事情做對、讓自己比昨天還要更好一點點，絕對比繼續漫無目的地虛擲光陰、放任每一個小問題擱置待解要好得太多。\n\n紀律是風險和混沌的唯一解藥。伴隨著這份紀律，帶來的是使你更能享受、珍惜生命的踏實感和自由，或至少，它將在生命的風暴中給你更堅強的庇護。這麼做，對你、對你所愛的人、對你身處的社群無一不是好的。\n\n別低估你今天可以做對的事。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%88%A5%E6%8A%8A%E6%B2%92%E6%9C%89%E5%B0%8D%E6%96%B9%E4%B9%9F%E6%B4%BB%E5%BE%97%E4%B8%8B%E5%8E%BB%E7%95%B6%E6%88%90%E7%B6%93%E7%87%9F%E6%84%9F%E6%83%85%E7%9A%84%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC":{"title":"","content":"tags:

，情感或習俗 。在這個意義上，理性化是現代社會形成的中心環節，特別在西方世界，以資本主義市場為基礎，官僚主義和國家管理的理性化狀態; 只是現代科學和現代技術的擴展。哲學家哈貝馬斯批評純粹的工具理性主義。「科學主義」也可以用來形容科學思維將自身提升到意識形態的過程。對於理論家，如鮑曼來說猶太人大屠殺 ，作為現代性表現的理性化可能是與令人遺憾的猶太大屠殺密切相關。——詳見[理性化](\u003chttps://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%90%86%E6%80%A7%E5%8C%96_(%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E5%AD%A6)\u003e)\n\n哲學的中心化與去中心化，是一個在文明層次的拉扯，在個人層次就如Fromm所述的、顯現於個人對自由的追求和逃避，或者說是個人對於混沌和秩序的偏好及調節。宗教或科學都並非一定是屬於混沌或秩序的類別，端看個人如何秉持這些信念；一個宗教對某人是秩序、對另一人可能是混沌，而科學亦然。\n\n哲學的中心化與去中心化，也可以在道德絕對和道德相對主義間的張力看見。道德絕對主義較容易與宗教掛勾，道德相對主義則經常被熱衷科學的份子所秉持。然而秉持「科學主義」的「理性化」現代人，有可能為標榜自己對多元自由的支持而秉持相對主義論點，但在個人生活中卻失去了中心化的哲學和道德權威，或索性將科學或存在主義視為內在權威。\n\n這個現象足顯個人生命中，某種哲學或道德上的內在權威實屬必要的，正如我們的生命需要一定程度的秩序來引領自身前進，所有價值的相對主義化、去中心化只會帶來疑惑、困頓、及失落。事實上，多數人都不是真正的虛無主義和道德相對主義者，我們幾乎總是帶著近似彼此的道德直覺在社會中生活，或許這正符合柏拉圖的觀點。\n\n\u003e知識是與生俱來的，因此學習只是將原本埋藏在靈魂深層的理想發掘出來，這種發掘的過程也經常是由哲學家所引導。柏拉圖相信每個靈魂在出生時都帶有「至善的形式」以及對所有事物的完美知識，因此當他們學習時只是將這些知識「回想起來」。\n\n中心化與去中心化的哲學、倫理、經濟、科技等面向，都深深影響我們每個人的生活，而我們終究得辨明的並不是何者才是正確，而是如何達到天平兩端的平衡。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%9F%BA%E7%9D%A3%E5%AE%97%E6%95%99%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E7%A5%9E%E8%81%96%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n[[神聖個人概論]]\n[[罪論]]\n[[📝/基督教的核心]]\n\n---\n西方文明的起點是希伯來文明與希臘文明，即所謂的「兩希文明」。\n\n希伯來文明的中心耶路撒冷，彰顯了猶太基督教的宗教啟示：一個全善的神創造了一個有秩序的宇宙，並要求人類依祂頒佈的律法去建立道德完善的社會、方能活出幸福的人生。希臘文明的中心雅典，則代表著希臘哲學的重要價值：理性與邏輯，並由家喻戶曉的柏拉圖、亞里斯多德等聖哲所體現。\n\n西方社會強烈的個體主義——我會說它是廣義的「神聖個人」觀念——在兩希文化中更被基督宗教所凸顯，其最明確的根源之一，是聖經、創世記1章27節：\n\n上帝就照著自己的形像造人，乃是照著祂的形像造男造女。\n\n這段話開門見山地闡明了人與神的關係、以及人類在宇宙中獨一無二的重要地位。在信上帝的社會裡，就因如此、亦僅需如此，每一個人的生命就有了其不可剝奪的神聖價值、有了其不證自明的存在目的。它說明了每一個人都是盛裝神性的容器、擁有實踐德行與榮耀上帝的潛能，所以背負著使世界變得更好的道德義務。近代習以為常的「天賦人權」觀念可說就是起源自此。\n\n另一個基督宗教最根本性的觀點是「罪」。\n\n\n對聖經故事稍有聽聞的人應該都知道「原罪」的來源：亞當和夏娃背叛天主、偷嘗禁果，所以被逐出伊甸園、失去與天主共融的幸福，人類從此背負了必死的命運、原罪則一代接一代遺傳後世。\n\n這就如罪是從一人入了世界，死又是從罪來的；於是死就臨到眾人，因為眾人都犯了罪。——《羅馬書》第5章第12節\n\n正因為人一出生就背負了原罪，因此縱然每個人都具備不可剝奪的價值，仍得付出相當的努力才能獲得上帝赦免，比方說信神、贖罪、勤勉工作、做上帝所喜悅的事、過上帝所悅納的生活等等（至於其中的細節，那就是不同教派間意見分歧的部分了）。\n\n上帝創造了宇宙及其律法，人的犯罪便是行了任何違反上帝標準的言行思想。在希伯來語裡，罪的原意是「偏離目標」（Missing the mark），這個解讀很值得再三咀嚼，它說明了要避免「罪」，你必得有個「我應該如何為人」的目標，並專心一志地朝之前進，而不是輕易滿足於現狀或放過自己，否則任何行差踏錯都可能是犯罪。\n\n綜合以上，基督宗教為我們點明了「神聖個人」的深刻詮釋：每個人都具有神聖不可剝奪的價值，但一個人的價值並不存在於「他所是」的狀態、而是由「他所能夠成為」的人所彰顯。若套入基督教的語彙，那就是你不該安心接納自己作為原罪遺傳者的現狀，而是要努力過著親近上帝的生活、活出足以榮耀上帝的潛能。\n\n雖然近代西方世界逐漸疏離了自己文化底層的基督教根基，反以啟蒙主義的純粹理性來包裝這份對個人神聖性的重視，但難以爭辯的是，基督宗教的洞見仍是使西方個體主義兩千年來生長茁壯的土壤。這或許是現已高度資本化、世俗化的西方社會需要反思的文明課題。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%9F%BA%E7%9D%A3%E6%95%99%E7%9A%84%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83":{"title":"","content":"tags:

讓基督教與眾不同的，是這個非常奇異的宣稱：**神成為了我們的一份子、成為了一個「被造物」，但祂既沒有喪失作為上帝的身份、也沒有掩蓋被造物的完整性。**\n  \n  正如〈出埃及記〉中、摩西遭遇的「焚而不燬的荊棘」：\n  \n  \u003e 耶和華的使者在荊棘的火焰中向他顯現。摩西觀看，看哪，荊棘在火中焚燒，卻沒有燒燬。摩西說：「我要轉過去看這大異象，這荊棘為何沒有燒燬呢？」\n  \n  在這裡，神就是「燃燒」的動作本身，但特別的是，神的「燃燒」雖然散發著溫熱和火光，卻不燒燬任一枝葉——這說明了神的作動原則：祂越是接近我，就使我越發有光彩，卻絲毫不會減損我的存在。\n  \n  將這個概念提升到極致，即是我們所謂的「道成肉身」：**上帝之子作為受造物來到世上，以其極致的方式要使全人類變得美麗光彩**——此即基督教的支柱。\n  \n  隨之而來的，是對所有現實的救贖。所以不僅僅是人類的救贖，更是在成為受造物的過程中，上帝將整個世界神化了。所以希臘先哲說「**上帝成為人類，以使人類亦可能成為上帝**」——這對於基督教的核心觀點是個不錯的總結。\n  \n- 假如上帝變成人類，那就意味著人類存在一種根本上的尊嚴，且超越了任何人本主義者能用以證明人類尊嚴的任何宣稱。\n  \n

被奴役的能源\n\n人類歷史發展至今，第一個重要的文明轉捩點，是在約莫十萬年前、地球氣候變暖並穩定下來時，發生的第一次農業革命。當時，[轉向農耕和畜牧的人類部落，其生產力大大地超過了仍以狩獵採集為主的表親](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/was-agriculture-impossible-during-the-pleistocene-but-mandatory-during-the-holocene-a-climate-change-hypothesis/246B240BFFFBE904B1AC31296AD72949)。\n\n農耕帶來大量的生產力盈餘，[使早期人類向全球擴散](https://wwnorton.com/books/The-Social-Conquest-of-Earth/)，擴大了貿易範圍與科技發展。到了16世紀，[更複雜的社會組織和先進的航海技術](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Europe/The-emergence-of-modern-Europe-1500-1648)又開啟了人類歷史上另一個驚奇篇章。至此為止，[人類文明都是以生物能——人類和草食動物的肌肉——作為生產活動的動力來源](https://vaclavsmil.com/2021/03/05/grand-transitions-how-the-modern-world-was-made/)，增長幅度有所侷限。\n\n直到19世紀初，一切都改變了。\n\n人類發現如何提取及利用地殼表層下的化石能源——煤炭、石油、天然氣等——來驅動我們的生產活動。就地質學來說，人類無疑是發現了「**被封存在地底的太陽能**」。在新能源龐大的力量面前，人類和動物的勞動從此退居次位。這乃是史上頭一遭。\n\n結合了機器的力量，一加侖的汽油可以在幾分鐘內輸出與一個人勞動一整個月相同的工作量。雖然人類使用肌肉工作的能量效率和靈活度是非常優異的（可以想想，驅動一輛汽車的汽油有多少變成了廢熱散失），但在需要蠻力的任務上，再多的人類都無法完成化石能源的工作。\n\n工業化的故事，基本上就是以化石能源（加上機器）取代人類勞動力，創造更高的利潤、更高的工資、更便宜的產品。在過程中，我們的能源使用效率變得非常低，但經濟效益非常高。來到20世紀後半葉，當我們又成功將動力來源從煤炭升級為高品質的液態石油，人類經濟的平均增長率再次翻倍，現已是過去幾千年平均水平的30倍以上。\n\n在現今活著的79億人類中，排除兒童和退休人士，實際的人類勞動力是45至50億人。全世界每年使用354億桶石油，若把我們使用的所有煤炭和天然氣也換算進去，總數則是1000億桶石油。與全球人類的勞動力相比，由化石能源驅動的機器為我們增加了等同於5000億個工人的力量。\n\n化石能源的龐大力量， 使數十億人類得以出生，使數十億的人脫離貧窮，更創造了新的神話、制度、以及對未來的期待。無怪乎哲學家Buckminster Fuller將化石能源比喻作人類的「**能源奴隸**」。\n\n\n\n我們祖先的生活與地球的自然規律——太陽、雨水、土壤——緊密相連，但在近幾個世紀一飛衝天的經濟和科技趨勢中，人類與大自然的基本聯繫先是被忽視，然後被遺忘。 \n\n[現今經濟的主要驅動力](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067)大多是免費的。我們往往只需要支付它們的開採成本，卻不必擔心它們如何產生的、它們真正的價值為何、以及它們可能造成的污染。對我們的祖先來說，化石能源簡直就是從地底噴發出來的魔法。 \n\n然而，我們不但不知道要對這個一次性的天外橫財心存感恩，反而還捏造故事自欺，宣稱人類此刻擁有的財富和進步，皆是來自我們的聰明才智。 \n\n現代經濟理論認為，生產力（它是我們財富和物質進步的基礎）是勞動和資本的產物。在這個等式裡，能源只不過是**另一種投入**，其單位價格僅僅代表著**其對經濟產出的貢獻**。一桶石油代表了人類將近5年的勞動力，而我們只消支付其開採成本（目前在2022年約為50美元），卻不必考慮它被創造出來的數千萬年進程。\n\n我們對化石能源——這項人類經濟的主要投入——並沒有支付正確的價碼，現行的經濟學理論更是輕易忽略了這個事實。**我們已然對能源的真實價值和有限性徹底目盲。**\n\n\n---\n\n# 被篡偽的貨幣\n\n**從過去到未來，能量都扮演著生命的「貨幣」。**\n\n就這個理解，動植物就是能量的第一批投資者——獲取更多的「能量盈餘」，就能使動物在生存和[繁殖](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/152/%C2%A0)方面更具競爭優勢。換句話說，「能量盈餘」的作用正是物競天擇的核心驅動力，為大自然決定了什麼可能發生，什麼不可能[發生](https://www.jstor.org/stable/84174)。\n\n當然，人們很少用能量的角度去思考這些事。\n\n生活在化石能源為我們帶來的神奇魔法時代，幾百年來人類消耗這顆稱為「地球」的大電池的速度，是大自然日常光合作用的數百萬倍。化石能源為人類經濟可運用的剩餘[能源](\u003c[能源](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/188/)\u003e)帶來巨幅增加。\n\n但這個封存於地底的魔法可不是用之不竭的。\n\n高質量的礦石和能源礦藏已經是過去式了。現在雖仍存在著大量礦藏，但它們的質量較低、開採成本較高、對生態環境破壞性也較大。在自然界中，有無數例子表明了能源確實存在，但要提取它們的代價過於龐大，以致許多選項已不可能被考慮。**在我們的有生之年，人類社會將不得不把越來越多的能源盈餘轉用於獲取能源本身，留下更少我們負擔得起的能源來支持眼前的許多經濟活動。**\n\n就像獵豹付出同等的力氣去追逐一隻肥羚羊、一隻瘦羚羊或一隻兔子會得到完全不同的效益，我們在德克薩斯州的油井、在海底5英里處、或在阿爾伯塔省的沙漠裡榨取石油所得到的效益也大不相同。地球表面下確實存在數萬億桶石油——而且我們知道它們在哪裡——但要怎麼用經濟上（和生態上）有說服力的成本去取得它們，那完全就是另一個問題了。\n\n在這個前所未有的大量剩餘的時代，我們擅長將能源和原料組合成改善人類體驗的科技和發明。新科技可以讓我們更有效地使用資源，或者將自然的運行轉化成能源，但大多數科技都只是為人類創造了新的消費方式，並建立了未來對[能源](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00026/full)和[原料](https://read.realityblind.world/view/388478403/143/)的更高要求。即便像太陽能和風能的綠色能源，也往往只徒增了我們的總能源消耗量，更甚至沒有減少[全球的碳能源使用](https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-market-report-july-2021)。\n\n\n\n大多數人認為金錢是真正的財富。然而，我們花錢買到的一切，都需要能源來開採、創造、交付、運行、和維護。就這個角度來說，**金錢其實是人類對[能源和資源](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067#bib0680)的開價。**\n\n我們的經濟故事宣稱，有了更多的錢，我們就可以[創造更多的東西](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070)。 但事實是**自然資本——特別是能源——才是我們貨幣體系的真正基礎。當我們創造更多的貨幣時，我們並沒有創造更多的能源，我們只是在加速能源的透支。**\n\n隨著石油產量的增長達到達到了[最高點](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/gdp-growth-rate)，人類經濟有史以來最高的持續增長率在50年前達到了頂點。但我們並沒有就此滿足，反而投機取巧來延長經濟成長。\n\n**債務，可謂現代經濟的神奇魔術——它讓我們花費來自未來的資源、維持高消費水準，並稱之為[經濟成長](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067#bib0680)**。 大量舉債的現象在過去50年間變得如此普遍，我們早已習慣了「今天享受、明天付帳」的生活模式。\n\n**先進國家現在正利用[債務](https://blogs.imf.org/2021/12/15/global-debt-reaches-a-record-226-trillion/)來提領我們本來沒有能力提領的資源，用以生產我們本來沒有能力消費的商品。這種策略肯定有個截止日——因為有一天，這些新產生的錢都必須被花在真正需要能源的實際事物上。**\n\n\n\n**現代文明已將人類的生命經驗徹底金融化**。我們不僅把人類生活的豐富層次化約為單一的貨幣標記，還貼上了錯誤的價格——所謂錯誤，是以長遠、超越人類自身範疇來說。\n\n貨幣的價格是錯誤的，因為我們可以恣意按按鈕來增加貨幣供應，預支我們根本還沒有提取的天然資源。\n\n能源的價格是錯誤的，因為我們將之視為理所當然、無窮無盡的地底魔法，忽略了它們在任何人類的時間尺度上都是不可再生的。\n\n而現在，人類這個擁有近80億成員的社會性動物正集體追逐著「利潤」；以國內生產毛額計價的「成長」，儼然成為了社會穩定的必需品。人類文明將各項決策和計畫外包給龐大複雜的金融系統，市場對「成長」的上癮卻已取代了任何可能蘊含智慧和自律的替代方案。\n\n這個系統不再受到任何人的控制。人類——就這個定義上——已經成為一個盲目、永不滿足、貪求能量的[超個體](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B6%85%E4%B8%AA%E4%BD%93)。\n\n\n---\n# 被挾持的人腦\n\n人腦是演化的產物，[我們在工業社會裡每一天的所作所為背後，都埋藏著與祖先相同的演化趨力，驅動我們去追求同樣化學成分的大腦酬賞](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-98504-000)。想當然，這對我們的行為、經濟、以及未來都有深遠影響。\n\n[多巴胺這種神經傳導物質的角色，是為動物——包含人類——創造**動機和行動**](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110094415.htm#:~:text=The%20widespread%20belief%20that%20dopamine,something%20either%20positive%20or%20negative.)。人們多有誤解的是，產生多巴胺的不是獎賞本身，而是對獎賞的預期。我們[在追求某種東西——例如購物、商業交易——的過程中，多巴胺水準最高](http://youtube.com/watch?v=axrywDP9Ii0)，但在征服了目標之後，多巴胺水準就會消退。\n\n[在物質豐穰的現代社會裡，大眾已對消費太習以為常，以致我們對物質的「**渴望**」遠遠無法被真正「擁有」給滿足](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/66/)。身處在這個擅長把數十億桶石油轉化成多巴胺的經濟體中，我們慣性地搜刮著那些無法帶來長期滿足感的東西，並透過更多的消費來獲得同樣的感覺。\n\n\n\n人類作為社會性的動物，我們亦承襲了祖先強烈的部落性格、對社會性訊號非常敏銳。我們不但善於與他人比較，也時常尋求認同、接納、權力、及地位。\n\n[隨著物質和帳面財富逐漸成為主要的社會地位象徵，染上了消費主義之病的我們，往往不是著眼於我們真正需要的東西，而是想要能擁有和其他人一樣多——甚至更多——的表面資產](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905187/)。[越來越多的研究顯示，我們更關心自己收入／財富的所在「級距」，而不是實際數字](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610362671?journalCode=pssa)。在一個以消費（而不是社群、生態、仁慈、或創造力等）為中心的經濟體系中，我們的「絕對財富」和「相對財富」間存在著重要的差別。\n\n人類的部落性亦顯見於我們判斷他人「非敵即友」的傾向上。[現代人仍然會堅定地支持自己的內部群體、輕易排斥外部群體](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221616)——這個現象小至支持的球隊，大則擴及政治立場、種族或國籍。演化使我們非常擅長為自己不喜歡或不理解的狀況，去指責那些我們陌生但又不願瞭解其立場的人類。\n\n\n\n在充斥著物質財富、資訊爆炸、社群媒體橫行的當代文明中，人們已經無可救藥地深信這些觀點：金錢是真的、現代文明的進步要歸功於人類的聰明才智、經濟還可以繼續成長下去。又即便[當我們指望他人的觀點、企圖自己眼前的複雜世界時，我們往往比較在乎「誰說的」，而不是邏輯和證據](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2017/11/03/brain-science-heres-why-you-cant-resist-celebrity-endorsements/827171001/)。\n\n石器時代遺留至今的人類大腦，已無法和不斷挾持你我注意力的演算法匹敵。現代媒體的終極目標就是吸引人們的注意力、將點擊和分享轉換成消費、捕食我們的好奇心和部落心理。\n\n**[充斥各處、為營利而持續優化的演算法，正透過麻痺人們的自覺、加速成癮行為、激化對立、鼓勵對科學的冷漠及不信任，進以分裂我們的社會。](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/09/27/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/)**\n\n相較於氣候變遷、能源浩劫、經濟泡沫等危機，社會的對立激化似乎是個獨立的問題，然而**如果我們無法對「是非真偽」有一套共同的認知判準，就不可能針對人類的未來進行有意義的討論**。現階段來說，經濟成長還勉強可以被當成人類群體的共同目標，但隨著成長趨緩、破碎、甚至完全消失，「共同目標」將會是人類集體必須面對的重要挑戰之一。\n\n\n\n人類畢竟是壽命有限的動物，[在情感上，未來對我們來說並不重要](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/96/)，我們往往\n只關注近在眼前的時間向度：這週末的計劃、這季度的收益、這一期的選舉，以及下一串吸引目光的貼文。我們擅長承諾自己從「明天」開始會做出重大改變，然後明天變成後天、後天變成下禮拜，就這麼循環往復、繼續推遲著實際的作為。\n\n[心理學上這叫做「衝動」，經濟學上這叫做「雙曲折現」](http://theoildrum.com/node/7147)。這種時間偏好不但能解釋個人行為，也顯見於人類在能源方面的抉擇。\n\n[就跟其他動物一樣，人類好求收穫、厭惡損失](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/loss-aversion)，所以我們會尋找被低估的股票來投資、鎖定球鞋的促銷活動、或暢快享受Happy Hour的啤酒。[與其他動物不同的是，人類是個極為社會化的物種](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302252/)；我們會以家庭、小企業、公司、甚至民族和國家為單位進行協調，以最大化我們的虛擬盈餘——金錢——然後把它們花在真實的東西上。\n\n在生物學上，「最適攝食理論」告訴我們，在其他條件固定的情況下，動物如何最佳化他們的能量效益。就算我們能夠拋棄資本主義作為現代世界的組織模式，這種「以最少投入獲得最大收穫」的驅動力仍然會存在於我們的本能之中。\n\n這種本能也有其反效果——[我們對損失超級敏感](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/82/)。你的投資從10000元漲至11000元時的愉快，無法補足它從11000元跌到10000元時的沮喪，畢竟在我們祖先的時代，今天運氣好得到了額外食物確實不錯，但運氣不好失去食物時就可能會要人命。\n\n**我們在經濟和生態上的真正挑戰，來自於人類仍以狩獵採集者的原始大腦，在充滿競爭性的消費成長文化裡生活。[人類天性的錯置，驅策我們打造出這個已經不再真正關心自身（人類）福祉的超個體。](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067)**\n\n\n\n看看我們今天的生活方式，或許有人會聳聳肩說「人類就是這樣」——這是個誘人但廉價的觀點。現代社會，只是人類歷史長河裡成千上萬個繁榮文明的其中一個。[今天活著的人類並沒有「選擇」自身階級或文化的貪婪，相反地，我們大部分的人生選擇都受到自己出生的經濟體系所制約。](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/ultrasocial/FE883BB2158FE38C96DD8670E99CC730)\n\n說真的，人類並不是生來就有環境或能源問題，我們眼前的這些問題是不小心把地球上80億人的狩獵採集者大腦泡進消費成長文化這淌渾水的結果。這世界的現狀不是任何人的錯，但我們大多數人都是幫凶。瞭解到人類文明的「超個體」現實或許會令人非常沮喪，因為這顯示了沒有人可以真正做點什麼，但它不僅澄清了我們面對的現狀，也揭露了未來可能的道路。\n\n人類文明當前的高消費、貧富不均、科技迷戀、缺乏人際連結等現象，皆是地底能源魔法的直接產物。\n\n[雖然人類的大腦無法迅速改變，但在適當的條件下，行為和社會規範有可能閃電般地更迭](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1149491/)；我們在面對挑戰時具有難以置信的適應能力。\n\n我們可以安全地相信，人類近代的生活方式是種反常現象，只不過我們視之為理所當然，因為作為個體，這就是我們所認識的一切。\n\n邁向未來，一些適應了低能源使用的生活方式將重新連接我們的虛擬世界和物理世界，讓我們能重新建立對「是非真偽」的共同理解。立基於真實的人類需求（而非債務推動的消費主義和經濟成長），我們的生活將不必這麼全球化，但能享有更多的人際互動，以及與大自然的可貴連結。\n\n作為一個物種，這個貪婪短視的全球性超個體絕非我們的命運。人類之所以被帶到這個懸崖邊，是因為我們「所是」的本性；但這個時代真正的課題，將取決於我們——作為個人、也作為社會——「所能夠成為」的樣貌。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E6%89%BE%E5%88%B0%E7%A5%9E":{"title":"","content":"tags:

for a person is to interact with who you believe the person 'could be', not who the person 'is'\n\n\n\nFirstly, you never really get to know a person 100%, thus it's not okay to assume you know what 'reality' is. You don't fully know a person 100%, nor do you know the 'reality', so don't assume you've take it into account\n\nSecondly, the respect you pay a person is not based on who he/she is, but what you expect out of him/her. It's not to say you should based your interaction with people on who you expect them to be, even though it's quite often the case, be it negative or positive.\n\nA better way to put it is that, you don't interact with what the person is, but what the person could be. Even though it's gonna base on partially your expectation, but it can also be based on what the 'ideal self' that person can be.\n\nThink your interaction with a kid. Often times we don't necessarily interact with a kid in the way that we really see what he/she is, rather we interact with who we believe he/she can become. It's not possible to shy away from your own expectation of a kid, but at the same time, it's safe to assume that you know what's 'more than who he/she currently is', and so does everyone else around.\n\nWe interact with a kid in this way. We put a universal expectation and encouragement around the kid, so he/she continues to act 'more' and grow. We don't interfere with the interaction by seeing that he/she is not at a certain level that it's not enough for us to continue any communication.\n\nThis is quite precisely why teenagers often feel not respected by adults, because adults act in a way that tells them 'you're only what you are - a teenager' while they want to be viewed as 'more than who they currently are'. They know fully well that they're not yet adults, yet giving them such respect and the corresponding personal responsibility is one of the best way to cultivate their characters and forge them into real adults.\n\nWhen we see who a person 'really is', it's useful to ask yourself if you've lost 'faith' in this 'reality'. You need to understand that every 'better future' is emerged from a 'not-that-good-yet now', and every person's 'better/ideal self' is emerged from the person he/she is today. It's fairly easy to lose faith in humanity when you simply 'see reality as it is' yet don't fully understand that the current reality is precisely what gives birth to a better future. Same with any person, regardless whether you think so or not, because as stated, you don't fully know the person, nor his/her potential.\n\nDon't assume you know reality well enough that you can look down on it. Give each person - essentially a facet of the reality - his/her proper respect, by treating him/her as who they could be, not who they currently are.\n\nThe same goes with yourself. Instead of going with what others expect from you (which is very useful as well), you should also put the same self-respect and expectation-for-more onto yourself. Living up to others expectation is great, but living up to your own expectation for yourself and in turn alter what others expect from you, is often times more fulfilling.

\n[[後現代的價值真空]]\n[[科技是形塑人類歷史的無形力量]]\n\n---\n所以我們會問：為什麼現代人揚棄傳統、抗拒責任、蔑視美德，卻沒有更快樂、反而有前所未有的大量心理問題？為什麼現代人不再信仰個人生命的神聖意義，反而樂於向外討伐應該負責和值得怪罪的對象？為什麼「覺醒」的年輕一代，對社會體制秉持批判態度、樂於打倒舊時代偶像，卻將改善個人生活的責任歸咎於政府或大公司身上，自己反而不想努力了？\n\n在高度全球化的二十一世紀，這其實更多是全球經濟、國際情勢、以及當代科技的緣故：現代經濟由債務驅動，透過前所未有的貨幣流通量，預支未來能源來支出當年度GDP；全球供應鏈使將七大洲的民生存亡繫成一線，新冠肺炎輕而易舉地癱瘓了多數人的生活；政治角力背後終究是為了便宜人力和能源所讓步的姑息主義；消費文化鼓勵我們用更多的錢、注意力、個人隱私去換多巴胺，養肥的是一堆超級了解我們的演算法、以及科技巨頭的資本。\n\n這個情景下，古典美德毫無用武之地、宗教傳統亦缺乏對現狀的解釋力，理所當然地，現代人便逐漸背離古典美德、放棄儲蓄、用享樂主義填補追不上通貨膨脹的無力感、甚至看透了生命意義的虛無。\n\n**當「個人」不再是任何人能有所作為的施力點，我們便難以相信自己在家庭裡有值得犧牲的使命、在經濟上的辛勤能有未來報償、在人生中的苦難能獲得意義與救贖。** 人們對於犧牲的信念遭到掏空、對社群的信任遭到侵蝕、個人的道德潛能遭到壓抑，而最終，**我們一個個都成了這個「超有機體」裡、被以生產力和消費力計價的行屍走肉。**\n\n犧牲的信念需要經驗的驗證、情境的允許、甚至信仰的跳躍，但在這個時刻，前兩者已站不住腳，後者也就無力說服多數人。\n\n在實務上，宗教信仰帶給人的一個優勢，是能夠較堅定地相信「彼岸救贖」的存在，進而支持、合理化此生的犧牲奉獻和道德作為。然而，講求事實理性、不再懷抱傳統道德和宗教信仰的現代人，已很難用「陰德」或「死後審判」的彼岸觀點來約束個人行為、提升品德。所以在尼采說「上帝已死」、杜思妥也夫斯基說「若無上帝，一切皆可為」的這個時代裡，我們才會遭遇如此深層的道德焦慮——一方面，我們很享受沒有老大哥監視、不用擔心死後彼岸的自由人生；另一方面，我們卻像浮萍般在紊亂難解的世界局勢裡無所依靠、向宇宙探問著生命的意義。\n\n一定程度上，這也解釋了為什麼現代人如此熱衷政治、社會正義、環保運動，幾乎到了宗教式的狂熱程度。Jonathan Haidt指出演化為人類配備了「超越小我、融入大我」的**宗教性趨力**，當現代人以為自己擺脫了迂腐迷信的束縛，實際上卻是幾乎任何東西都可以成為宗教的替代品、都可以充斥跟宗教同等的狂熱和偏執、也都可以成為討伐異己的「聖戰」之端。\n\n所以我們必須認清，**再多痛心疾首的道德呼籲都不會是解決這個世代難題的充分解答**，因為我們身處的全球化經濟系統，是個逼著所有人一起為不切實際的經濟目標奮鬥的雙輸賽局。基於更高的道德理想而先在這個遊戲中踩煞車的人，只是置自己的生死不顧、優先讓自己喪失競爭資格而已，卻改變不了其他為求生存的人埋著頭繼續遵從遊戲規則。\n\n我們確實需要人們重拾生而為人的高貴德性、昂首闊步地活出有意義的道德生活，但我們更需要一個嶄新的理解，幫助我們搞懂這個似乎不可能有效解決任何大規模重要問題的紛亂世界，進而**有意識地將人類的未來導向正確的方向，創造能使每個人更易於培養和體現德性的「可靠的」情境**——我相信，這是當代人類的緊要任務。\n\n**人類必須能夠有脈絡地、有共識地理解你我身處的世界，我們才可能重拾犧牲的信念、看見奮鬥和受苦的意義，並願意為了人類更美好的未來奉獻此生。** 從這裡，我們必須踏出個人道德生活的範圍，邁入科技、經濟、政治的領域，而那就是我們日後文章將企圖探索的。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E8%88%87%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Line甚至不是真的樂手錄的，而是MIDI加音源做出來的。\n\n既然現在要做出很棒的錄音幾乎不需要花大錢進錄音室、發布音樂也根本不需要有唱片公司看上你，那麼真正隔在音樂人和樂迷之間的，就只是一首夠好、夠打動人的歌。於是乎，三十年前一個城市裡寥寥無幾的錄音室裡的錄音師，他可以仗著你幾乎不可能找到第二個有能力按錄音鍵的人來幫你完成專輯，而對你頤指氣使大小聲，至於他有沒有拿出像樣的熱忱來服務你的藝術，你也沒有說嘴的份。但現在，如果你想要、而且你對自己有像樣的要求，那麼你可以不用忍受任何一個「老師級人物」對你的指指點點和難配合的態度；你有本事就可以自己來，或者找到名字後面不會被加上「老師」兩個字、但是對你的作品有一百分熱忱的音樂人來幫你一起完成。\n\n對於花了十萬個小時、甚至吃了許多苦才培養出一技之長的匠人們，確實，這看起來是一件令人跳腳的事情，但那些汽車組裝員何嘗不是如此？還有在那之前，那些因為汽車普及、不再有人騎馬而生計受影響的農家呢？人類工作因科技進步被剝奪，這當然不是件輕鬆愉悅的事情，然而我們很難不同意這終究是為人類整體帶來更多便利及安康的必要過程。\n\n我們就接著聊汽車及其相關產業的趨勢：傳統上，人們大多基於通勤的需要而買車，傳統油車有著眾多會耗損的部件需要保養維護。人們買車後除非營業需要，不然開車的時間幾乎不可能比熄火的時間多，亦即大部分的車在大部分時候都沒有在開。於是有了Uber或iRent這樣的服務出現，前者透過數位科技讓自用車可以加入營業車行列，後者透過數位科技讓營業車得以扮演短暫的自用車（即租賃），兩者都是善用共享資源的新興生意模式。\n\n值得關注的下一步，也就是Tesla現在帶頭在做的事情：電動化與自動駕駛。電動化是能源問題的關鍵、也大幅改善了傳統油車的折耗缺點，而自動駕駛，則是試圖將「人為錯誤」直接從個人運輸的這幅圖像中完全移除。今天，當AI已經有能力在超短時間內做出直逼工匠的繪畫，或許人們一直半信半疑的自動駕駛也確實如Elon Musk所承諾的，已經離我們的生活不遠了。而屆時，我們或許可以想像一種完全去中心化（與大眾運輸工具相對）的個人運輸工具，建立在數位科技、共享資源、和自動駕駛之上，那將使得「通勤」這件事情從此不再是人們需要擔心的事情，而將焦點放在你從A點到B點過程中的體驗、或者是你在過程中能創造的其他價值上。而屆時，玩車、養車、自己開車，想必會是一些人懷抱浪漫熱情的嗜好——就像有人會想去馬場騎馬一樣。\n\n在這個「精粹化」的過程中，我們都知道人類逐漸走向知識經濟的工作型態，而隨著AI、機器人、數位化的科技發展，可以預見的是人類的工作型態會越來越遠離任何形式的勞動與技術，而更聚焦於「人類靈魂」昇華之上——如果不介意我用這樣的字眼的話——意思是說，你我在工作上的價值，會由我們的創新與創意（創造力）、問題解決能力（理性）、看待事物的優先順序及如何對待其他人（倫理價值）所展現。大概還有一些我沒想到的「人類本質」也可以被放進來。\n\n但是有些人會接著擔憂的事情是，那AI是否可能有一天淘汰人類、或使人類退化到根本無法產出任何價值的境地呢？或許你腦中跳出了電影《瓦力》中那些只剩下一顆大頭和短小四肢的29世紀人類的畫面。不過我想那畢竟是個可愛版本的後末日圖像，如果真的有那一天來臨，那麼人類應該比較有可能變成《駭客任務》裡電腦母體的電池，而不是坐在自動運輸工具上的笑呵呵小胖子。\n\n若以比較認真的角度討論這點，我不認為有好理由相信人類真的會因為科技的過度發達而「用進廢退」成任何四肢短小的小胖子，原因倒也很簡單，因為經過700萬年演化而來的我們，作為「人類」的本質仍是不可能脫離身體的，換句話說，你的身體即是你的心智。\n\n我們知道讓小孩去外面跑跳蹦會對他的認知能力有幫助；我們知道賀爾蒙會影響我們的心情、慾望、以致思想；我們大概也可以想像三十歲的自己和六十歲的自己之所以用很不一樣的方式看待人生，一部份是因為經驗，另一部份是因為老化。科普書會用一些有趣的實驗證實所謂的「具身認知 (embodied cognition)」，但其實我們早就已經看過無數關於「身體跟心智無法分割」的例子，只是我們沒有深刻體會這件事而已。\n\n也許是我對技術太過無知，但這是為什麼我認為在根本上、人類不可能將自己的意識（或「靈魂」）移植到另一個載體上——我們的意識跟身體是無法分割的共同體。倘如沒有了這顆大腦、這個身體的感知、這組免疫系統和內臟器官、以及串連這一切的DNA，那所謂「你自己」真的還在那兒嗎？這並不是說我們的意識或自我無法超越身體、用身體之外的方式存在於這個世界，而是強調身體作為人類與世界互動的必要支點。\n\n這也是為什麼科學家在設計AI的過程中，發現如果需要讓AI能夠獲取人類世界的資訊，那麼「具身化 (Embodiment)」——亦即賦予AI近似人類的肢體或器官——是個必要的步驟，如果看過Boston Dynamics的機械狗，應該就略有所感。畢竟，我們身處的世界，就是個以「人類」這片拼圖的形狀，去往外開展開的一面超巨幅圖像；我們日常生活中接觸的多數事物，都是以你我作為使用者去建立的——轉頭看看你房間的門把就知道了。我們甚至可以說社會倫理也是類似的東西（但那是另一個話題）。\n\n我無法用我不熟悉的技術詞彙去描述「具身化」的概念，但我們可以用先驗的方法來瞭解人類如何認知這個世界。一如這個哲學問題說的：「假如一棵樹在森林裡倒下而沒有人在附近聽見，它有沒有發出聲音？」我認為答案是沒有，因為「聲音」這個詞的存在，其實隱含了「聽覺」的存在。基於同理，在一個沒有任何生物擁有「視覺」的宇宙裡，是沒有「看見」這回事的。\n\n所以要AI在這世界裡用近似人類的智慧運作，它們就必須先「具身化」以獲取人類在世界上運行的每分每秒都接收著的資訊。但獲得這些資訊還只是第一步，下一步更得讓AI學會如何做出「價值衡量」、進以完成人類會需要完成的任務。價值衡量意味著什麼？意味著AI終究必須碰觸倫理問題，因為人類的「智慧」就是建立在對無數資訊和事物的取捨之上，而什麼該取什麼該捨的「優先次序」問題，就是倫理問題。所以說，自動駕駛車要利用機械學習去辨認路標並不是件難事，難的是今天當左轉會撞到一個小孩、右轉會撞到一個老人、直踩煞車可能會害車上的市長命喪黃泉時，車子到底該往哪裡走。\n\nGoogle開發的Alphago已經在圍棋的對奕中展現了堪稱「創意」的驚人步數，我猜想AI在不久的將來也可能展現出極富「理性」的作為，而屆時，人類尚未被取代的本質還剩下什麼呢？我此刻的感覺是，那恐怕就剩下「道德」了。這也或許只是因為我不認為人類自己無法解開的道德難題，AI會有辦法解出來；又就算解了，AI的答案若不能被人類所接受，那我們真的會說那是個好答案嗎？「道德」這一關，在我看來確實是人類自己可以球員兼裁判、不可能被AI所取代的。\n\n\u003eConnecting

\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14\n[[後現代的價值真空]]\n\n---\n「樂觀虛無主義」表面上既符合科學事實、又通融人性需要，看似是個適合當代人類的生活態度，然而當我沿著它指引的方向走下去，我發現「樂觀虛無主義」幾乎是個太奢侈、太安逸、且帶著某種「道德健忘」的淺碟人生觀。\n\n原因如下：\n\n## 1.　它沒有真的論證人生為什麼值得活\n\n如果你身有殘疾、親人臥床、受飢貧或戰亂所困、生活在社會底層……你該如何看著自己了無意義的痛苦人生還樂觀得起來？無論虛無主義可以多樂觀，都無法帶給一個迫切需要希望的人足以活下去的動力。\n\n卡謬直指了問題的核心，他說：「真正嚴肅的哲學議題只有一個：那就是自殺。 判斷生命值不值得活，就等於回答了哲學最基礎的問題。」然而，世上多數人都不是擅長辯證生命荒謬與否的哲學家，就算能用最嚴謹完備的論證去解答「該不該自殺」這個終極哲學問題，也不會讓人類整體的生活方式有任何改變。人們依舊會希冀看見黑暗中的微光、找到支持他們去承擔生命苦難的堅毅。\n\n雖然「樂觀虛無主義」嘗試論證人的生命為什麼值得活，但我相信多數時候，它只會成功說服生活相對舒適、能歡欣鼓舞地喊出「Why not?」的樂天靈魂，卻無法在你我承受著無可避免的悲痛苦難時，為我們注入更多的堅忍和勇氣，甚至告訴我們如何用帶著尊嚴與祥和的姿態受苦——在「樂觀虛無主義」裡，這是個會被考慮的可能性嗎？\n\n## 2.　它沒有提供任何形式的道德指引\n\n承上，「樂觀虛無主義」要我們去做讓自己快樂的事、創造自己的人生意義、活出自己想要的生命，但這個樂天美好的個人主義宣言並沒有告訴我們應該如何對待他人、應該如何對待自己、以及為什麼我們該或不該在乎這些事。它迴避了關於價值和道德的「應然」問題，將問題留給每個人去自己思索，卻也沒有阻止你把這個問題當作不存在。\n\n如果我們都只是宇宙的塵埃，那麼就算我不是個有道德的塵埃又何妨？我又何需思考我這枚塵埃和其他宇宙塵埃之間的關係？我為什麼會有責任該去善待自己和他人呢？\n\n這些顯然都不是很有用的想法，因為關於「應然」問題的答案，才能指引我們在日常生活中貫徹一致的言行、在遭遇重大抉擇時看清前進的方向、在無可避免的苦難中幫助我們蛻變成更堅毅的自我。不知道或不去思考自己應該如何為人，等同心裡沒有個靶，一切言行都只是見機行事、無的放矢。\n\n為什麼要有一致的言行，為什麼不能見機行事？很簡單，因為一致的言行意味著我們秉持明確的價值觀去和現實世界磨合、在過程中辨明是非並修正錯誤，也使他人能夠信任我們；見機行事的結果是，你不會知道當下的成功是否僥倖、挫敗是否自找，所以無法複製良機、無法避開災厄，而他人更難以信任你。\n\n## 3.　它其實沒有回答如何創造生命意義\n\n「樂觀虛無主義」建議大家做自己會感覺良好的事，行有餘力可以順便扶老太太過馬路，但如果要你說這就等同於「創造生命的意義」，我相信你不會對自己的答案太有信心。\n\n確實，有許多天賦獨具的人能在全神貫注的創造性活動中得到豐沛的意義，但是更多人的生命意義，會來自於生產性活動（通常是工作）與責任的承擔（通常是家庭）——這既不是秘密、也不應該是個有爭議的事實。Victor Frankl在他的納粹集中營回憶錄《活出意義來》（Men's search for meaning）中也有類似的理解。\n\n在「樂觀虛無主義」裡，我們發現了人生並無目的，但基於某個未被說明的原因，我們執意得定義自己活著的意義，然而要創造什麼生命意義、如何創造這份意義、你創造的意義跟他人創造的意義之間有什麼關連……那就再說，總之就是可以自己創造就對了，畢竟尼采就是這麼說的。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E6%AA%A2%E9%A9%97%E8%AD%89%E6%93%9A%E8%88%87%E5%8B%95%E6%A9%9F":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Skeptic的Alex作為一個也同樣熱衷辯論信仰問題的無神論者，說他之所以如此關心這個問題、並樂於與信徒對話，就是因為「上帝的存在與否」是個對於人類生命的最重要問題，所以他熱衷於討論這個最高優先度的問題。）\n\n在資訊爆炸的時代裡，別輕易信服那些會「引用證據」說話的人，因為 **「引用證據」的過程是有品質差異的**。若引用觀測到極端值的寥寥幾個研究，便等同擁有了顛倒是非的能力，能輕易讓那些對證據和蒐證過程不夠有警覺心和判斷力的人上鉤。\n\n我們不只要關心證據說什麼，更要關心**證據背後的統計**、**蒐集證據的過程**（認知偏誤是非常容易犯的錯），避免被那些精挑細選出對自己有利證據的人所誤導。同樣地，我們要主動去搜索對立的證據，一個簡單的Google搜尋（但最好是用VPN或無痕模式）就能一定程度地告訴我們兩方證據的充分程度。\n\n然而有趣的是，也有人說當代的科學研究的趨同性太高，甚至像Nassim Taleb會說的，有些研究領域的研究者關心的已經不是自己的研究是否正確、對人類有用，而是其他同儕會不會認同自己——缺乏Skin in the game的研究，只會淪為學術小圈圈內自娛的譁眾取寵。真正有所突破的研究，應該是少數的、尚未被人們所接受、甚至受到一定程度排擠的。如果我們是在討論這樣的領域時，恐怕就非常難判斷證據的完整性。\n\n所以，當我們真的沒辦法判斷證據的完整性和精確性時，我會主張，我們該關心那些企圖論證的人**背後的動機、甚至是道德上的立場**。對此，我們只需要問兩個簡單的問題：「如果他說的是對的，哪些人會得利？」以及「他是否收取了利害相關人士的援助？」只要能回答這兩個問題，我們就有好理由選擇該相信或不相信對方。但同時，這絕對不代表我們在自己無法判斷證據完整性、但又不想相信對方時，就應該直接懷疑或指控對方的動機——這顯然是無益討論、搬弄是非的糟糕態度。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E6%B0%A3%E5%80%99%E9%81%8B%E5%8B%95%E5%AE%B6%E6%98%AF%E5%B0%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E7%A8%AE%E4%BE%AE%E8%BE%B1":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n在大流行趨近尾聲之際，孩子們又回到公眾領域，Greta把未來的聲音又帶回了談判桌上——我們必須為後世的子孫留下一個更好的世界。\n\n但這些高談闊論並不是真的關於兒童或後代，它們更應該被理解作一種高調的現在主義——**透過將不遠的將來描繪成全人類的緊急狀態，這為今天的全球政治菁英在其公民頭上採取的各種政治及經濟決策，提供了完美的道德掩護。**\n  \n忘掉今天，忘掉此刻的公眾選擇；唯一重要的是「行動」，而唯一有能力行動的人，是那些握有權力的人。否則，這一切——根據Greta的說法——都只是 \"blah blah blah\"。\n\n這種論調很普遍，但它不能掩蓋一個事實：**透過民主決策去應對氣候變遷問題的時機實已成熟**——尤其當這個決策需要我們拿自己今天的生活和我們孩子的未來做出權衡時。現實是，我們看到的並不是讓選民長期參與的公眾辯論，而是全球政治菁英在抗議人士要他們「少說多做」的慫恿之下，卯起來想在為時兩週的論壇上完成他們的國際承諾。\n  \n不幸的是，這種聚焦於「未來」、省略了公民參與的大聲疾呼，具備了一定程度的吸引力。尤其因為年輕一代越來越相信公民主權不足掛齒，他們相信真正的改變只能指望那些有權力的人去實現。一位參加COP26（第26屆聯合國氣候變遷大會）罷學活動的學生說：「我們不會是能做出改變的人，我們只能呼籲改變必須發生。」——無知地預設了，實質的解決方案只可能是由上而下的。\n  \n隱含其中的是，**氣候運動家傳達了一種生活於「風險社會（risk society）」的情緒——在這個社會中，被放大檢視的威脅、不確定性、以及壓倒性的無力感，成為人類經驗的框架。** 風險社會的概念，是由社會學家Ulrich Beck和Anthony Giddens在20世紀末提出，用以描繪現代的全球化威脅將使自主個人再無用武之處的「歷史終結」情境。\n  \n從這個角度看，我們的社會所面臨的問題是不可克服的。當面對緊急的氣候危機時，唯一可行的解決方案是迅速的、全球性的重大措施；由單一國家的公民採取的民主決策，在最好的情況下會是無濟於事、在最壞的情況下會是適得其反的。\n  \n然而，我們當前面臨的危機，其實揭露了否定個人自主性的矛盾之處。\n\n在Covid大流行期間、以及現在的緊急氣候危機之下，當人們聽聞政治、科學、科技巨頭、和其他全球化機構的領導者所給出的鬼話連篇，隨之產生的是對風險社會的宿命論及生存主義心理。我們一面聽說Covid是前所未有的超級致命傳染病，一面聽說人類絕對可以根除這個病毒、戰勝疫情。但在氣候危機當前，宣稱我們就在「午夜前一分鐘」的誇張說法被當成藉口，認為我們有可能懸崖勒馬、在短短幾年內停止暖化並扭轉局面。\n\n這個願景帶給我們的是一種「新常態」：從今天的行動開始，我們要消除過去行動所產生的環境傷害、並重新出發。要實現這種「技術生存主義（techno-survivalism）」，只能經由公民承認自己的束手無策、並要求政治菁英們行使他們手中權力去做出改變。\n  \n波蘭社會學家Zygmunt Bauman在其2011年出版的《Collateral Damage》一書中預測了這種情況：在討論「權力與政治的分離」時，Bauman指出「**可行方案和預定目標之間的距離，被體現於『欠缺長期權力的政治』與『擺脫政治限制的權力』之間的永久拉鋸。**」\n\nBauman認為，在我們面臨的長期全球緊急狀態下，國家將被認為是無足輕重的；國家的民主制度要麼不適合、要麽沒有能力去推行需要發生的改變。選民們由於缺乏長期的權力，只能在一旁互相叫囂，而全球政治菁英們卻可以假「拯救明天」之名，自由自在地做任何符合他們當前利益的事情。當社運人士不惜一切代價要求各國政府有所作為、政治菁英們順水推舟地量產出他們的國際共識時，技術生存主義為有權有勢者提供了服務其自身利益的絕佳機會。\n\n如果Bauman是對的、而政治已經不具有任何意義，這實際上代表什麼？歸根結底，當我們的政治菁英們逐漸遠離其人民的同時，也也偏離了他們搞清楚自己應該做什麼的軌道，而這最終可能直通他們的垮台。正如Christopher Lasch在《The Revolt of the Elites》中所說的，通過將自己隔絕於社會整體，政治菁英們亦掏空了手中權力的合法基礎。\n\n在揮舞手中權力並因此獲益的同時，不受約束的菁英們更可能相信，個人自主性不復存在的世界仍可以正常運作——但這顯然是不可能的。\n\n在疫情期間，最初的「在家上班」命令很快就被大量的例外情況所抵銷，因為政府被迫承認有太多「必要」的工作需要人們外出；後來當企業主企圖勸說「在家上班」的人們回到辦公室，則遭受到冷漠的抗拒。同樣地，當COP26計畫的「綠色革命」縱然可以被強力施行，但仍舊需要人們的認同；人們在選擇換掉他們的汽車和鍋爐時，他們總是衡量著這對他們的生活品質有何影響。\n\n當人們對政治的信任度下降，他們就會找到其他更不容易被調解和控制的方式，來行使他們的權益。**對於政治菁英們來說，合法性是他們能握有權力的關鍵，而這需要他們在過去和現在之間建立合理的連結，而不是以「未來」之名消滅這個連結。**\n\nEdmund Burke在他的《Reflections on the Revolution in France》中優美地詮釋了這點：**社會應該被理解為一種「契約」、應該被慎重地看待，因為它不僅僅是關於當下的需求，它更是「在所有美德、所有美好事物上的夥伴關系」，它超越了任何特定一代人的貢獻，從而成為「不單單是活著的人之間的夥伴關系，更是活著的人、那些死去的人、以及那些尚未出生的人之間的夥伴關系」。**\n\n然而對於許多現代政客而言，這個世代間的契約只能通過撕裂過去、以未來之名立法來兌現。這種不受約束的權力揮舞或許在短期間能產生效益，但在某個時間點，這種無視過去、信任、自主公民的意識形態會反噬我們，而屆時，承擔後果的未必會是未來的人類，也可能就是現在還活著的我們。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%82%BA%E5%8F%97%E9%9B%A3%E8%80%85%E7%A5%88%E7%A6%B1%E7%9A%84%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E6%84%8F%E7%BE%A9":{"title":"","content":"tags:

我們既不會說拿多數人的當下福祉去換少數人的未來福祉是種「犧牲」，也不會說用當下比較多的福祉去換未來比較少的福祉是種「犧牲」。所以我們才會盡可能購買未來仍會保值、或至少對我們一樣有用的東西，而不會把消費力逐漸縮水的錢留在手上。\n\n要理解犧牲的概念，就必須認知其不可或缺的兩個要件：\n\n第一，是時間。如果說「失去」即是「過去的某個時間點我曾擁有，但現在我不再擁有」所呈現的落差，那麼「犧牲」就是「現在我有所付出（失去）、或未能享有某些東西，是為了在某個未來的時間點，我將擁有某些我現在沒有、且更值得的東西」。**沒有時間的概念，就沒有辦法觀察到因果關係；沒有正確的因果關係，就沒有正確的犧牲。**\n\n所以第二，是**對正確因果關係的認識**。過去是我們已經看過的，現在是我們眼前的，未來是我們無法看見的。在任何人親自驗證過一個犧牲行為將在未來兌現之前，沒有人真的知道現在的付出是否能產生未來的酬賞。若缺乏驗證，那麼說穿了就只是「賭賭看」而已。\n\n驗證的方式有很多，一種是看看前人已經做過什麼。已知的文明、傳統、宗教、乃至習慣和常理中，都有許多人類在歷史長河中不斷試錯、累積下來的一系列已驗證的、能被複製及流傳的犧牲行為：做好事有好報；以生兒育女的辛苦換取個人成長、生命意義、老年保障；對人有禮貌有公德心以換取他人未來的尊重和禮讓等。當然，這些犧牲行為不會總是百分之百能換得未來好處，但當社會中有越多人願意秉持信念去實踐，每個人能夠因此受惠的機率就會越高、並反過來強化大家對這種適度犧牲的信念，形成正向的循環。\n\n另一方面，當我們計畫採取的犧牲行為並不是他人驗證過的、或我們並不知道是否有人驗證過，這時運用經驗、知識、及理性去推論、評估、思辨，就會是必要的工作。這也是所謂「投資」和「投機」的差異：前者有一定程度的理據（至少對本人來說），後者則通常空有信念、結果為運氣左右。一個帶有「投資」意味的犧牲行為經過夠多人的驗證，便有機會成為風俗習慣、甚至深入傳統或文明的土壤。\n\n如果用「對正確因果關係」的不同認知程度去劃分，我們可以整理如下：古代宗教的「獻祭」，是人們普遍對因果關係有充足信念、但缺乏充足理據的犧牲行為；近代社會的禮俗、習慣、文化、傳統，通常是人們普遍對因果關係有充足信念、也有充足推論的犧牲行為（沒有充足推論的簡稱「迷信」）；個人或小群體的「投資/投機」行為，則是部份人對因果關係有充足信念、也可能有充足推論，但仍未說服多數人、或被大眾充分驗證的犧牲行為。\n\n然而，犧牲的信念並不總是隨處可尋。我們雖能夠驗證某個犧牲行為在無數前人生命中的運作，但仍然不會知道在自己的人生中，我們拿出來跟未來交易的籌碼是否夠具份量。就像我們一輩子看過無數生兒育女的父母親，但當今天為人父母的是自己時，我們仍不會知道自己是否配得上這個重擔、也無法預見自己在這條路上將有哪些獨特的遭遇。\n\n因此許多時候，「信仰的跳躍」乃是必要的。舊約聖經中，亞伯拉罕因信仰上帝而沉痛獻祭愛子的生命（在緊要關頭被天使阻止），因此通過信仰的考驗、成為上帝在世上的代理人——神話以某種極端戲劇性的角度向我們闡明，**或許我們並不總是知道當下的犧牲是否會有所回報，但我們往往更不明白自己固守的貪愛之物遠非生命至高的美好，也壓根無法想像有比現況要美好太多的回報在犧牲的另一頭等著。** 帶領人類跨越經驗、知識、理性的極限，踏入未知、實現想望、成就整體的，總是人心底層的這份信念。\n\n唯有對普遍的犧牲行為抱有足夠信念，人才有動機去成為正直、勤儉、善待自己和他人、具備遠見及美德的公民。否則，人便不會為更大的群體進行長遠考慮、不願以短期的付出和不便去換取未來回報，他們將耽溺於眼下好處和欲望的立即滿足，成為貪戀現狀、吝於付出的自私個人。各大宗教之所以總有某種賞善罰惡的終極原則，就是因為假如人不再相信讓當下自己稍微不方便、可以換取未來更大的酬賞，便會如杜思妥也夫斯基所言：「若無上帝，一切皆可為」。\n\n更重要的是，**若缺乏犧牲的信念，人將無法承受生命中必然的重擔與苦難、無法看見受苦的意義、也無法相信痛苦的另一頭會有平靜與和解。剩下的，只會是生命意義的失落、以及對上天的嘶啞控訴。**","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%8F%BE%E4%BB%A3%E6%96%87%E6%98%8E%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E4%B8%8D%E4%BB%B0%E8%B3%B4%E5%8C%96%E7%9F%B3%E7%87%83%E6%96%99":{"title":"","content":"tags:

20 世紀的水泥產量。另一方面，現在全世界一年消耗的水泥比整個 20 世紀上半葉還多。\n\n這四種要素如此迥異，但有三個共同點：它們難以替代、它們只會更被需要、它們的產出很大程度地取決於化石燃料的燃燒——也就是排放溫室氣體。\n\n值得思考的是，就連對再生能源的轉移也需要大量的鋼鐵、混凝土和塑膠。像風力發電機這種指標性的綠電象徵，其建材是鋼筋混凝土、塔架和軸承是鋼鐵、葉片是極耗能源生產且難以回收的塑料樹脂，而這些部件都需要特大卡車或輪船載運、並由大型吊車架設——理解了它的製成、運輸、組裝、和運轉，我們便很難說它是真正「綠色」的電力。\n\n另一方面，一台使用鋰電池、大約450公斤的電動車，含有約11公斤的鋰、近14公斤的鈷、27公斤的鎳、40多公斤的銅和50公斤的石墨——以及約181公斤的鋼，鋁和塑料。為一輛車提供這些材料，需要加工約40噸礦石，考慮到其礦石中許多元素的濃度較低，需要提取和加工約225噸原材料。\n\n積極電氣化公路交通的結果，只有可能是將上述的能源消耗以成千上萬輛的幅度提高。\n\n除非在提取、加工、運輸這些材料和產品的能源都能來自可再生能源之前，現代文明在根本上是不可能脫離這些要素所仰賴的化石燃料。\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%90%86%E6%83%B3%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9%E8%80%85%E6%AC%A0%E7%BC%BA%E7%9A%84%E8%AC%99%E5%8D%91":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Self-Determination]]\n[[後現代的價值真空]]\n[[願景的衝突]]\n\n---\n當尼采聲稱上帝已死，他痛訴是我們殺死了祂，卻沒有像樣的東西可以填補這個「神形狀的真空」（帕斯卡）。\n\n尼采批判基督宗教的「此岸彼觀」——現世只是過渡、彼岸的理型才臻完美——是種敵視生命的觀點，因此在宣佈上帝已死之後，人類必須重新樹立生命價值、戰勝虛無主義。 \n\n如今，我們可以在社會文化中清晰觀察到尼采的重大影響，尤其是對彼岸理型的敵視。\n\n若以尼采可能偏好的措辭來說，現代人不再懦弱、迷信、低聲下氣地過著他們相信只是過渡的人生，苟且寄望著美好的來世；相反地，現代人勇敢、理性、昂首闊步地將此生過好過滿，相信自己來到此世本就帶著毋庸置疑的價值。\n\n假如過往的此岸彼觀是迂腐怯懦的，那麼現代人正巧展現了人類的勇敢和理性的展現；但換個角度，我們也可以說此岸彼觀使人類終其一生保持謙卑，而尼采為現代人帶來的，則是無須辯解的傲慢——或許熱愛古希臘文明的尼采並不會介意這個說法。 \n\n現代人經常秉持著「我們有能力將美好帶來此世」的信心，而這種理想主義使現代人樂意信任個人經驗和特定權威，反而不願意嚴謹地遵循權力分立和去中心化的系統性進程。\n\n海耶克說「通往地獄的路上撲滿了善意」，然而「充滿善意的干預」如今卻充斥於現代政治、文化、種族、經濟、能源等各種面向上。\n\n這也是湯瑪斯·索維爾在《觀點的衝突》討論的「Unconstraind Vision」——以理想主義看待人性，所以相信具有遠見和道德高度的人有資格引領並改變世界，也有責任剷除文化或體制中的敗壞陳腐。\n\n秉持這種信念的人，不願意相信系統性、去中心化、一步一腳印的集體進程，更難尊敬引領人類走到今天的文化根基。\n\n然而人類終究是部落主義的動物。\n\n現代人已經不再共同相信某種「人類無法企及之理想」的存在，而更傾向於堅持烏托邦「必須」在我們眼前被建立。於是尼采為我們帶來的「高貴的生命勇氣」，成為了二十一世紀這種無法妥協、為達目的不擇手段的理想主義。 \n\nJonathan Haidt指出演化為人類配備了「超越小我、融入大我」的宗教性趨向。\n\n對於現代人，任何東西——政治、種族、性向、環境——都可以成為宗教的替代品，只不過許多人相信自己是天選之人、要為此世創造一個無可妥協的烏托邦。\n\n或許，這個時代迫切需要的，是被我們連同彼岸和理型一起丟棄的那份謙卑。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%90%86%E6%83%B3%E6%98%AF%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E6%84%8F%E7%BE%A9%E7%9A%84%E5%89%8D%E6%8F%90":{"title":"","content":"tags:

(Missing the mark)，在基督教中正是「罪」的原意。\n\n所以，在我們企望著意義的生命中，不容忽視的是你我所秉持的理想、以及我們為達至理想所採取的行動。而我們之所以熟悉自己的怠惰苟且、無法將自己視為有責任幫助的對象，便是因為太多時候，我們的良知其實拿著某個我們拒絕承認卻無法擺脫的理想來跟自己比較。我們的自我批判正是源自你我和心中的「理想自我」間無法漠視的差距。\n\n現代人經常相信可以「創造自己的價值」，亦即自由地選擇要相信什麼作為自己最高的理想，但事實是我們根本做不到。如果一個人真能創造自己的價值，那麼想當然爾，他最輕鬆愜意的生活方式就是讓他的良知永遠對自己言聽計從、沒有一秒鐘需要懷疑自己是否做得夠好或做錯了。但顯然，我們的理想與良知並不是全然由自己掌控，反而更像是依循著某種舉世皆然、不證自明的自然法理；你的良知對你的警告、跟我的良知對我的訓誡，經常是同大於異。這一定程度上呼應了榮格的「良知是上帝的聲音」一說。\n\n個人與其理想間的關係，解釋了宗教信仰被遺忘的深刻意涵：宗教崇拜，是人類數千年來對於某種大家共同相信的「理想存有」（理想的價值或理想的人類原型）的傳頌；宗教的教義，則是信徒用來自我修正、以微薄之力去體現和致敬這個「理想存有」的依歸，亦可視為歷代人類以生命經驗去累積出的、通往理想生命的地圖。\n\n雖然現代人習慣將宗教傳統斥為迷信，但拋棄了生命地圖的結果，卻是二十一世紀人類所面臨的深刻孤獨和焦慮。這也顯示了，世俗的現代人在更深的意義上並不是真正地相信虛無主義或無神論，比較常只是拒絕具體地思考什麼值得作為「理想」、自己又該為達至「理想」做出哪些犧牲和改變。\n\n然而，抗拒對生命理想的思考並不會使你的良知噤聲，假裝自己「已經夠好了」也不會真正讓你安然自得，因為我們無法擺脫對生命意義的需要，而生命意義必然會在你邁向理想的實踐中產生。齊克果所謂的「真正的人生是『宗教性』的人生」，我想與此無異。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E6%84%8F%E7%BE%A9%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%AC%E8%B3%AA":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n[[對意義的渴望]]\n\n---\n如果追根究底，其實不難發現「樂觀虛無主義」在語意上是個矛盾的概念。\n\n當你知道1+1＝2，你不會問「這樣是好還是壞」或「這是應該發生的嗎」。如果我們用真正的虛無主義觀點去看待人類的存在、真的以百分之百的客觀理性行事，那麼在得知「人生本無意義」的客觀事實之後，我們並沒有理由接著辯解「為什麼我應該／不應該繼續活著」。追問「為什麼要做任何事情」或「為什麼不做點什麼」都是不必要的反射性問題；接著思考自己「應不應該自殺」也同樣是不必要的抉擇。\n\n「樂觀虛無主義」就像是聲稱你相信「善良的數學公理」，你一手高舉客觀事實、另一手卻為之強加了主觀的信念。\n\n不過不同於數學公理，「虛無主義」描述的是一個關於人類生命的根本事實、一個直接挑戰了你我存在本質的尖銳論調。作為一個「意識」的本體，你可以一輩子都對數學公理和一籮筐的其他事物恍若未聞，但你不可能對自身的存在毫無自覺——這個事實只是「我思故我在」的倒裝句罷了。\n\n所以「樂觀」的主觀態度和「虛無」的客觀事實這兩個在技術上互不相容的詞彙，卻能毫無矛盾地共存於許多人的生命觀，是因為經由人類的自我意識，許多事物得以存在於「應然」和「實然」、「主觀」和「客觀」、「價值」和「物質」交疊的灰色地帶裡。\n\n舉例而言，道德、新點子、意識形態等「非實際存在」的事物能以有形且有脈絡的方式左右物質世界的運作和資源分配，而農耕工具、印刷術、iPhone等「實際存在」的東西也都用非常具體的方式扭轉了人類世界的心智、價值、和秩序。廣受好評的《人類大歷史》（Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind）更是鉅細靡遺地描繪了人類如何透過對上帝、金錢、國家等「不存在」事物的「共同想像」，進行大規模的合作、帶來驚人的文明進步。\n\n但身在如此宏大深遠的文明長河之中，你如何能說道德、價值、甚至金錢和國家等事物都只是不真實的想像物呢？難道我們該相信是這些「不存在」的東西幾千年來在地球上開疆闢土倒海移山的嗎？\n\n或許我們真正該反思的是，「何謂真實」這個問題其實遠比我們所想的要深刻細微且包羅萬象。\n\n綜合上述，其實「生命意義」的問題打從一開始就不是純粹的「實然」問題、不是一個能被客觀觀察的科學事實；發現人類在宇宙中的渺小進而相信人生並無意義，那也只是你對生命意義的主觀詮釋。\n\n「意義」是一個存在於「應然」的、我們摸不著也看不見的信念，但它能具體地指引你我每分每秒的優先次序、情緒感受、時間分配。看見生命的意義與否，能決定一個人選擇耽溺自艾和寬宏堅毅，繼而用非常實質的方式影響他和他周遭他人的生命經驗——這個你我都能親自驗證的區別，向我們證明了「意義」的「真實」。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E6%AC%8A%E5%8F%8D%E5%A2%AE%E8%83%8E%E8%AB%96%E9%BB%9E":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[政治]]、[[墮胎]]、[[神聖個人]]、[[親職]]、[[道德]]\nRef: [[Stephanie Gray - Pro-Life Arguments]]\n\n---\n\n- ### 先總結支持墮胎的立場 \n\t- 支持墮胎的立場，歸結於身體自主權。我們（美國）是一個痴迷於自主權的文化，痴迷於擁有選擇和控制的權利。因此，支持墮胎的人會說這是關於我的身體自主權，我控制我的身體的權利。如果我想墮胎，亦即我將自己的身體交付到墮胎醫生的桌上，那麼我應該有權利被允許這麼做。\n\n\n- ### 墮胎並非僅涉及婦女的身體\n\t- 我們知道，當婦女進行墮胎時，涉及的不僅僅是她的身體。當一個婦女做了驗孕，她並不想懷孕，而測試結果為陰性，她會去墮胎診所嗎？ 顯然不會。但是如果測試結果是陽性，而她不想懷孕，那麼她會考慮去墮胎診所嗎？ 是的，這就會是她考慮的選項。 \n\t  \n\t- 驗孕的陰性結果，基本上是在說：這只是你的身體、這裡只有你而已，不用擔心。但當她的驗孕結果呈陽性時，這就告訴她這不再只是她的身體，這裡還有「另一個身體」，所以她才會考慮要墮胎——一個假如今天結果是陰性時她便不會採取的行動。\n\t  \n\t- 那麼，這位婦女現在在考慮墮胎的事實，等同於承認了有另一個身體存在。那麼我們該問的是，那「另一個身體」的身體自主權呢？那個人類的選擇呢？我確實可以選擇把我的身體放到墮胎醫生的桌上，這是一個選擇，然而當我懷孕了，這件事情就會影響另一個身體。如果我相信一個人的身體權利，我就需要保護那個尚未出生的人的身體權利。\n\t  \n\t- 婦女在懷孕時的所有生理反應，都是因為有另一個身體的存在。如果這裡存在著另一個身體，那麼我們怎麼對待這個身體、跟我們「應該」對待這個身體，就存在著重要的區別。如果真的要，我幾乎「可以」做任何事情，但我們真正該問的是，某些事情是否是我們身在一個相信人人生而平等、相信基本人類生命權的文明社會中「應該」做的事？\n\n\n- ### 回應「胚胎非人類」論點\n\t- 普林斯頓大學的教授Peter Singer認為，所謂一個「人」，應具備理性、意識或自我覺知。因此，墮胎的支持者會說，懷孕前幾周的胚胎、甚至懷孕前三個月的胎兒雖然在生物學上是人，但這個實體並不具備理性、意識或自我覺知，所以即使在生物學上是人，它也不是人。\n\t  \n\t- 讓我們假想，如果我們對人的定義——那個賦予你生命權、不允許我我殺死你的定義——是建立在你的理性、意識、或自我覺知之上，那麼當你被打了麻醉正在接收手術的時候呢？在手術進行中，你並沒有理性、意識、或自我覺知，如果我那時問你說「我可以殺了你嗎」，你沒辦法回應「不，請不要殺我」。又假如你正在睡覺，我在你睡覺時輕聲說「我可以殺了你嗎」，你也不會拒絕，因為在那一刻裡你並沒有理性、意識和自我覺知。\n\t  \n\t- 即便如此，我們當然仍承認你是一個人，因為你的內在確實具備了理性、有意識、能自我覺知的能力，儘管你可能因為睡眠或被麻醉的情況而無法彰顯這些特質。\n\t  \n\t- 所以同樣地，擁有人類父母的胚胎或胎兒，他就是個人，在其本性中也具備了理性、意識、自我覺知的能力，僅因為他的年齡而暫時無法顯露。當你在睡覺時，你不能彰顯這些特質出來，但這可以很快地改變；對胚胎來說，那是因為他的年齡而無法表現，但這仍將將隨著胚胎年齡的增長而改變。很顯然地，我們的生命權應該以我們的存在為基礎，而不是以我們的年齡大小為基礎。\n\t  \n\t- 所以我會說，殺死一個人是錯誤的，不是因為這個人被殺死時是否能夠感到痛苦、當時是否有意識，而是因為被殺的個體是一個人類。一個未出生的嬰孩是否感到痛苦、是否有意識、是否能做出反應，因此並不重要。\n\t  \n\t- 這是為什麼我喜歡引用聯合國的參考資料回應墮胎的支持者：聯合國經常被認為是個支持墮胎的機構，但如果你看看他們的基本文件，會發現他們是深刻地支持生命的。《世界人權宣言》說：人類家庭的所有成員都有生命權。然後他們在第6條說：每個人都應該被承認在法律面前的人格。我們該問，誰是「每個人」？我們沒有理由反對未出生的胚胎也因擁有人類的父母而成為人類家庭的成員，所以第6條也適用於他們，就像適用於你和我一樣。作為人類家庭的成員，他們在任何地方都應該在法律面前被承認是個人。\n\n\n- ### 回應「生命何時開始」的不可知論者\n\t- 有些人會說他們不知道生命何時開始，而我會反問他們會在懷孕到第幾週第幾個月時禁止墮胎手術的進行。如果他們在懷孕六個月或出生時禁止墮胎，那麼他們就等同承認了生命從那時候開始，否則他們不會由那時起禁止墮胎。所以當他們聲稱他們不知道生命何時開始，他們仍通過劃定禁止墮胎的界限來描述了他們的答案。\n\t   \n\t- 那麼問題來了，你是根據什麼來確定生命的開始呢？是六個月？還是生命從出生開始？即使你認定是六個月這個數字，這個時間戳記其實也意味著我們認為六個月前發生了一些重要的事情，讓我們開始計算時間的流逝、看著時鐘滴答作響然後說「哦，滿六個月了」。如果受精是發生在三個月前，那我們為什麼假裝三個月後生命才起跑，而不是在精子卵子融合的那一刻呢？\n\t  \n\t- 有一篇科學論文《人類的生命何時開始》是由醫生和研究人員Maureen Condic博士所著。在論文中，她為生命從受精開始提出了一個驚人的理由：當我們有一堆細胞，並想知道這些細胞彼此間是相同還是不同的，科學家有兩個標準：細胞組成，與細胞行為。 \n\t  \n\t- 當你看一個精子細胞時，它的成分是父親的遺傳物質；當你看一個卵子時，它的成分是母親的遺傳物質。於是我們知道精子和卵子是不同的細胞，因為成分不同。現在讓我們看看其行為：當精子存在並活著時，它會游去尋找卵子並使其受精；當卵子存在並活著，它就坐在那等待精子的穿透。所以通過行為，我們亦可以看到精子細胞和卵子細胞彼此不同。 \n\t  \n\t- 接著讓我們根據單細胞胚胎或胎兒的標准來看看，這個胚胎或胎兒是跟精子卵子一樣的嗎？由組成的角度，在精子卵子融合的時刻，這個實體中就已經同時擁有了母親和父親的遺傳物質。即便兩個染色體的遺傳物質尚未交融，它們也都已經被包含在這個細胞中，所以通過成分我們知道我們正在處理不同的東西。從行為的角度，如果單細胞胚胎和卵子細胞相同，它就會允許被穿透；如果單細胞胚胎和精子相同，它就會游來游去，但觀察它的行為，我們看到它與精子細胞或卵細胞皆不相同。 \n\t  \n\t- 因此，我們知道實質上有新東西已經出現，而在精子與卵子融合之前，我們並沒有觀察到這些東西。這個新東西、這個胚胎，就是人類父母的下一代。\n\t  \n\t- 所以如果有人說，我不知道什麼時候禁止墮胎，因為我真的不知道生命何時開始，那麼我會說兩件事：第一，我會給他們關於生命開始於受精的科學依據，但第二，我會說如果我們不知道，我們不是更該謹慎行事嗎？如果你要炸掉一棟舊房子，炸藥都準備好了，但有人說：「我們還不確定是不是所有人都安全離開了，可能還有人在裡面。」你會說「但無論如何我們都要炸掉它」，還是說「在我們確定之前，誰都不許引爆」呢？\n\t  \n\t- 聲稱「我不知道生命何時開始」和聲稱「這裡沒有生命」是不同的。如果有人認為我們不能明確地說這裡沒有生命，那麼我們都該同意，應該要謹慎行事才對。\n\n\n- ### 回應「拯救人類嬰兒或冷凍胚胎」的思想實驗\n\t- 有人提出一種思想實驗：在一場大火中，你必須抉擇要救出一個人類嬰兒，還是救出二十個冷凍的人類胚胎，只能二選一。對於幾乎所有人，都會毫不猶豫地回答救出人類嬰兒。有人因此結論說所以人類嬰兒和胚胎的生命價值並非等值的，否則我們應該要選擇救出二十個冷凍胚胎。\n\t\n\t- 我認為我們多數人都會選擇人類嬰兒，是基於兩個原因：第一，我們可能對孩子有更多的感情——一種很自然的感情——我們也許都抱過、撫慰過或與嬰兒玩耍過； 但第二，是對成功率的分析。\n\t  \n\t- 當你分析這個情境，你會想說如果我救出這個孩子、把他帶出大樓，我不僅在這一瞬間救了這個孩子，而且這個孩子會繼續活下去。然而當我思考要帶著二十個冷凍胚胎跑出大樓時，就可能有許多變數了：首先我可能會擔心它們解凍而死亡，所以如果我把它們帶出大樓，它是否需要接上什麼東西才不會死掉？即使我能夠以某種方式使用發電機、或任何需要的東西來保持它們的冷凍狀態，它們事後是否會被植入母親體內，或者它們是否應該被植入，這都是完全不同的倫理困境。所以除了我們普遍跟嬰兒的情感聯繫之外，也牽涉到實際拯救生命的成功率。\n\t  \n\t- 一旦你開始分解這個情況，你就會發現這不是一個關乎墮胎的案例。無法拯救並不等同於直接殺害，更不是說如果我今天在大火中二選一沒有救你，你的價值就低於我所救的那個人。\n\n\n- ### 回應因母親生命危急的墮胎需要\n\t- 我們現在知道，作為一個孕婦，這涉及著另一個人的存在，而且是種非常特殊的關係——對於脆弱一方的養育和照顧。\n\t   \n\t- 當我們因母親生命危急而必須討論是否要採取墮胎手段時，我們首先要瞭解到，這件事情必須涉及了兩個生命——母親和孩子——他們在我們心目中擁有同樣的價值，我們認知到他們都是不可重複亦不可替代的；母親不比孩子更重要，孩子不比母親更重要，他們是平等的。\n\t  \n\t  但在此同時，我們也認識到其中一方更容易受到傷害，即年幼的胎兒。這個孩子實際上依賴於母親——雖其生命的價值與母親平等，但他依賴母親生存。因此，如果我們想在懷孕的大部分時間裡保護孩子的生命，我們實際上需要保護母親的生命。\n\t  \n\t- 然後我會說，為了釐清我們該如何回應緊急情況，我們應該認知到有一些我們可以採取的途徑是不道德的。儘管這些途徑對我們來說並不開放，也並不意味著我們找不到其他可採取的、有道德的途徑。想像你今天開車回家時，遇到一個巨大的橘色標誌，上頭寫著道路封閉、前方繞行，那麼你會逼不得已繞經這個社區才能回到你家。\n\t  \n\t- 因此，基於同理，當婦女的生命處於危險之中時，我們當然想達到挽救她的生命的最終目標，但這裡也存在著一個此路不通的障礙——有一條路是不對我們開放的，那就是直接且蓄意地結束孩子的生命，因為直接且蓄意地結束一個無辜人類的生命，是錯誤的。\n\n\n- ### 回應性侵懷孕案件的墮胎\n\t- 對於性侵懷孕的事件，我們需要採取兩種做法：一種是心靈層次的，另一種是頭腦層次的。我們需要從前者開始，我們必須承認任何受到性侵害的人都是受害者，他們都受到了創傷；那是一種殘酷的攻擊行為，我們無法用言語來形容它的邪惡卑劣。雖然我不能說我親身經歷過，但我透過身邊朋友的經歷，近距離觀察到它對那些經歷過的人的影響，我可以承認這是一件可怕的事情。那些受到傷害的人需要我們的支持，他們需要我們的愛，我們的同情心，還有心理諮商等等協助。\n\t  \n\t- 接下來我們要從心靈移動到頭腦的層次。在表達我們的同理心之後，我們該引入邏輯，並問出這個問題：墮胎會解除強姦受害者的痛苦嗎？你可能會說，墮胎並不會減輕他們的痛苦，但不將性侵懷孕的胎兒生下來，我們就能消除這個殘酷的提醒。換言之，總是會有那些提醒著受害者傷痛的東西，而我們得承認即使我們將「胎兒」這個特定的提醒拿走，也不可能完全消除所有其他的提醒、就不會有東西讓受害者想起他所受的痛苦。\n\t  \n\t- 我想提出的下一個問題是，對無辜的孩子判處死刑是否公平呢？一般來說，支持墮胎的人通常不支持死刑，（在美國）這些人也不會對強姦犯判處死刑，甚至不會對殺人犯判處死刑。所以我們要問，如果你不會對有罪的人判處死刑，為什麼你會考慮對無辜的人判處死刑？在強姦的情況下，有罪的一方不是胎兒，有罪的一方不是婦女，有罪的一方是強姦犯。\n\t  \n\t  因此，我們現在談論的墮胎行為，是為無辜的一方加諸後果、加諸一個我們甚至不考慮判處罪犯的懲罰。又即使我們願意判罪犯死刑，我們也應該都同意，沒有無辜的人應該為他們自己沒有犯下的罪行付出代價。\n\t   \n\t  所以墮胎並不能解除對強姦受害者的傷害，也不能消除她受到創傷的記憶，而且最根本的是，一個支持人權的社會，不應該對一個實際上沒有犯罪的個人處以任何懲罰，因為他們是無罪的。\n\t  \n\t- 值得深思的是，如果在同一個國家裡有兩個女人，她們都犯了罪，而根據該國法律，她們都得被判死刑。然而其中一個女人懷孕了，另一個女人沒有懷孕，那麼有趣的結果會是，腹中胎兒的存在能夠使他的母親免於死刑。其中關鍵便是我們承認了在她的身體裡有個無辜、無罪的一方，我們不應該為他們沒有犯下的罪行而殺害他們。\n\n\n- ### 回應「知名小提琴家」思想實驗\n\t- 《一個支持墮胎的論證》(A Defense of Abortion)由Judith Jarvis Thomson發表的1971年，其中最知名的「知名小提琴家」思想實驗，用於推翻「生命權比身體自主權重要」的論點。 內容如下：\n\t  \n\t  「有一位知名的小提琴家生病了，他需要輸血才能繼續活下去。但是，他血型特殊，不是每個人都能捐血救他。小提琴家的粉絲們不知從哪裡得知，你是唯一一個能輸血救他的人。於是，他們趁你熟睡的時候，綁架了你。醫生不知道事情的來龍去脈，就把你放在他旁邊，讓你輸血給他。你醒來時，發現你正在輸血給小提琴家，維持他的生命。這時候，你有權利可以離開，不要救小提琴家嗎？\n\t  \n\t  你一離開，小提琴家沒有你的血，他就會死。他有權利要求你留下來嗎？」\n\t  \n\t  聽完這個思想實驗，大部分人的反應是基於我們的身體自主權，我們有權離開、不救這個小提琴家。結論是，即使一個人有生命權、或是「活下去的權利」，也並不代表他就能限制他人的身體自主權。\n\t  \n\t- #### 討論自願情形\n\t\t- 首先，在小提琴家的案例中，你是被綁架的，未經你的同意就被綁在這個人的身邊。但在絕大多數情況下，婦女懷孕時，她們是同意性行為的。由於懷孕是一個性行為的可能後果，她們必須接受。（此即回應因節育失敗而產生的墮胎需求。）\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 就像你和你的小孩在街上打棒球，你小孩打到了球，球穿過了你鄰居的窗戶，你不能對你的鄰居說「我只同意要打棒球，沒有同意球會打破你的窗戶，所以我不需要負賠償責任」。如果你的鄰居把你告上法庭，他就能辯稱，你在有玻璃的地方打棒球，就自然有打破別人窗戶的潛在風險。所以當你選擇要在這個場域打棒球，我們就視同你已經認知這樣的風險，因此你必須接受後果，付錢替鄰居修窗戶。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 或者想像一對男女發生了性關係，後來他們分手了，女人發現自己懷孕，並希望把孩子生下來。如果做完親子鑑定，發現當初的男人確實是小孩的生父，她就有權向男人要求孩子的撫養費。那個男人可不能說：「我只同意跟你發生性關係，沒有同意要讓妳懷孕，所以我不會付任何一毛錢」，因為如果女人就此事將他告上法庭，法庭必定會做出對她有利的裁決——由於男人參與了性行為、創造了這個後代，他就必須承受相關的後果和義務，亦即幫助這個有經濟及生活需求的脆弱個體，並且支付孩子的撫養費。假如對男人這樣的期望是合理的，那麼我們就不能說對女人有此期望是不合理的。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 若回到小提琴家的案例中，我們需要重申一個重點：父母對他們的後代有責任，而我們對陌生人沒有責任。所以，我和小提琴家被一起綁在床上的性質是，我不認識這個人，所以要我用我的身體幫助他，是一件值得稱許的事，但並非我的義務、我的道德責任。然而當事情涉及到懷孕時，這就關乎父母與子女間的關係。\n\t\t  \n\t- #### 討論非自願情形\n\t\t- 讓我們接著討論非自願——比方說性侵懷孕——的情形。在這個情境裡，雖然他們沒有同意導致懷孕的行為，但由於在生物學上是孩子的父母——強姦受害者是孩子的母親——他們便有責任照顧他們的後代，這份責任並不是用於陌生人。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  如果一個孩子在你的城市裡挨餓，你去收容所工作並提供食物是樁美事，但如果你不去收容所當志工以幫助那些挨餓的兒童或成年人，你也沒有犯法。然而，如果你家裡的孩子在挨餓，而你拒絕給孩子提供食物，你會在法律上和道德上就有了疏於照顧的問題。\n\t\t\n\t\t- 所以說，在父母與子女的關係中，我們總是有責任幫助弱勢的一方。強姦之所以是錯誤的，是因為脆弱的一方受到強大的一方傷害；墮胎之所以是錯誤的，是因為脆弱的一方受到強大的一方傷害。我這麼說，絕對不是要粉飾性侵害的嚴重性和創傷，而是為了說明，當不公義、可怕的事件發生時，它並沒有給受害者許可，讓他們用任何他們想要的方式來回應。 \n\t\t  \n\t\t- 於是我會主張，性侵害的受害者懷孕後不必撫養孩子。問題是在那個時間窗口中、在沒有其他人可以撫育這個胎兒的情況下，是否存在著責任去滿足孩子的基本需求呢？\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 想像你和一個新生嬰兒一起被綁架。醒來之後你發現你出不去，也不曉得自己在哪裡，奇怪的是在這個小空間裡，有水、有營養品、有說明書、有所有你所需要哺育這個小嬰兒的東西。在這個情況下，雖然你也是綁架的受害者，但你並不需要什麼偉大的英雄美德才能夠滿足這個嬰兒的基本需求，因為同為受害者，他是個更脆弱、無法自力更生的個體，而你只是在做一件正確的事。我們也都會同意，當你能從這種情況中被解救出來時，你自然不該有責任繼續撫養這個孩子。\n\t\t  \n\t- #### 討論「基本需求」與器官的本質\n\t\t- 現在，墮胎的支持者會說，既然你被綁架也有責任哺育手邊的小嬰兒，那麼難道你不應該幫助跟你綁在一起的小提琴家嗎？你與那個孩子沒有血緣關係，你與小提琴家也沒有關係。然而這裡仍然存在著重要的差異，亦即人的基本需求與特殊需求。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 讓我們用另一個可能更彰顯身體自主權的情境來討論：想像你有一個長大了的孩子，你非常地愛他。在某個時間點，他因為腎臟病重病不起，除非他接受腎髒移植，否則就會死。很剛好地，你是世界上唯一一個適合移植腎臟給他的人。身為父母的你，把一個腎臟捐出來給你孩子，不是一樁美事嗎？當然，因為這會救了你孩子的生命，而且你有兩顆腎臟，所以這也不會要你的命。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  於是，支持身體自主權的人會說，你看，即便這個人是你的孩子也一樣、即使這是一個慷慨且正確的行為，法律也沒有要求我們一定要捐贈我們的腎給自己的孩子，因為我們沒有捐贈器官、或將自己的器官讓給他人使用的道德義務。所以在母親的情況下，也不應該被法律規範她有義務將身體讓予胎兒使用。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 要回應這種說法，我們必須問自己的問題是，腎臟的性質和目的是什麼，而子宮的性質和目的又是什麼？因為當我們問出、並回答這個問題時，我們就會明白為什麼父母不應該在法律上有義務給予其中一個，而實際上應該在法律上有義務給予另一個。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  腎臟，它存在於我的身體裡，是為我而存在，但子宮卻非常不同。子宮存在於我的身體裡，每一個月，它都在為了「另一個人」的身體做準備；每一個月，我的子宮內膜都在增厚，僅僅在等待著孕育後代的機會。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  因此，你可以說子宮迥異於其他的身體器官，因為它更大程度上是為了我們的後代而存在，而不是我們自己。這是為什麼我們的後代有權「使用」這個器官，而已經出生的孩子卻不能要求得到我們的腎臟。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 我們應該會同意，作為父母親，我們有責任去滿足孩子的基本需求。帶孩子去迪士尼玩，那是特殊需求；提供孩子食物、衣服、住所，那是基本需求。在懷孕的情況下，維持懷孕、允許胎兒住在子宮中——子宮存在的本質，就等同於胎兒的食物、衣服、和住所——這就是對於一個胎兒來說的基本需求。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  所以我認為，建立在親子關係、子宮的本質、以及胎兒的基本需求之上，我們有責任照顧尚未出生的胎兒。當討論到知名小提琴家時，那是超越職責的特殊需求。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%94%B1%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%B5%84%E6%88%90%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%A8%E6%9C%9F%E7%A4%BE%E7%BE%A4":{"title":"","content":"tags:

**「婚姻的基礎是什麼」的道德前提**，而我們這一世代人已經非常習慣相信婚姻所需的唯一基礎就是「兩個相愛的人」，尤其被同婚運動強力地提醒之後。\n\n然而，我也不是要主張「結婚是兩個家庭的事情」。台灣和許多其他儒家社會一樣，正經歷從東方的儒家觀念（兩個家庭的事）轉化到西方的基督教觀念（兩個人自己的事）的過程，世代間觀念的隔閡和摩擦實是文化變遷下的必然。我並不覺得一個比另一個更好，重點是大家要有共識比較好。\n\n---\n所以親友問我說什麼心態，我說是「**準備好要承擔彼此成為家人後的責任**」。\n\n我不敢說這是婚姻的完美解答，但這是我現在能想到的最好的答案，也是我能給自己做的最好的準備。\n\n成為家人後的責任是什麼？這沒有標準答案，因為每一對伴侶對「家庭」的想像都不盡相同、雙方家庭也會賦予各自的期待，每一個在婚姻關係中的人如何迎接、回應這些期待，都是自己人生的功課。\n\n但絕對不會變的是，**主動去承擔這些責任**永遠會比被動接受來得好太多。\n\n而這才是一對伴侶在結婚前就該琢磨清楚的：彼此對於家庭的想像是什麼？彼此對對方作為家人有什麼期待和要求？雙方家庭是否會有額外的期待和要求，彼此又是否願意承擔和回應？彼此是否期待對方為自己的家庭做點什麼？甚至，彼此對於扶養小孩的想像是什麼？雙方是否有一致的價值觀和教養原則，能夠在擔任親職的工作上有充分的共識和合理的分配？\n\n更重要的是，**雙方是否有共識、都願意主動承擔這些伴隨婚姻而來的責任**？假如沒有，我們如何能保證這段婚姻不會變成充滿怨懟的獨角戲？假如我們只是相信「相愛」便足夠、就足以為我們找到走下去的答案，我們又如何能保證有一天不會突然發現自己「不愛了」？\n\n有了對彼此的理解及共識、做好了自己的心理準備，我們才可能有**勉強夠多的智慧**去迎接婚姻這堂一輩子的課題，在柴米油鹽的消磨之下苦心經營這份得來不易的愛情。否則，一切都只是天真浪漫的豪賭一把罷了。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83%E7%9A%84%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC%E9%9A%8E%E7%B4%9A":{"title":"","content":"tags:

-\n無論在家庭、學校、軍隊、或職場，我們隨時都在摸索著當下身處之群體的目標為何、秩序是如何建構、人與人之間的關係是什麼，進以衡量自己的所在位置、用適當的方式言行。唯有如此，我們才能發現自己在群體中的功能和角色、發揮個人的所長、定義自身存在（之於當下群體）的價值——「社會化」正是一個人將「個體目標」向「群體目標」校準對齊的過程，它從我們牙牙學語以來就從未停止過。\n\n一間公司的共同目標若是「創造最大利潤」，那麼公司內的每一個人都需要被放在能夠成就這個目標的位置、各司其職，你跟其他人應該如何合作互動都會得到定義和規範，你也會被賦予相對應的使命和職責、定義著你之於這個群體的存在意義。同樣地，一個家庭裡的共同目標若是「和諧安康」，那麼家庭成員就必須為此齊心協力、扮演好各自的角色、充分認知到自己能夠為家庭創造的貢獻。\n\n這是為什麼在一個健康的企業文化下，思考「你可以為公司創造什麼價值」往往是對你有利無害的策略；這是為什麼在家中長輩重病時，理想狀況是家庭成員們都能清楚自己可以做點什麼，有錢出錢、有力出力；這更是為什麼對於一個社會新鮮人或家中小孩來說，他能替自己做的最壞打算，就是當一個難以合作、沒人喜歡、凡事只想到自己的自私鬼（我並不是說職場老鳥或家中長輩就有資格這麼做）。\n\n由此可見，所謂的社會階級——人在群體中的定位、專責、管理機制——就是眾人一起相信「某些東西比其他東西更重要」、奉行一系列共同的價值階級所產生的結果。\n\n當代名著[《人類大歷史》](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010774982)中最重要的論點之一，是人類如何運用「共同想像」去匯集超過單一部落的群眾、以完成唯有眾志成城才可能實現的巨大成就。在宗教組織、政治制度、金融系統等成功讓大量人類有效合作的「共同想像」背後，都蘊含了 「某些事物比其他事物更重要」 的前提：人們學會相信「某個神」、「某種政治理念」、「某些可交易的籌碼」比其他同類型的東西還更重要、更需要被捍衛、更適合作為引領眾人的指標。\n\n中國清朝亦有統計結果顯示，當遭逢飢荒時，宗祠林立的地區的動亂次數明顯少於那些只有零星宗祠的地區

[2]\n\n如果你細數自己一天中在每一個場合裡跟每一個人的互動，然後追根究底地探問「為什麼我用這種方式面對這個人」、「我為什麼在另一個情境下是那樣對待另一個人」，你得到的答案大多會是「不知道啊，好像就應該要這樣」。但今天當你去到一個文化迥異的國家時，你大概會深刻地感受到文化衝擊，並驚覺自己原本的日常生活中有多少人際互動是你視為理所當然、完全不會費心多想的。這向我們顯示了，社會的價值場域之於你，就像是水之於魚；你悠遊其中，卻鮮少察覺它的存在。\n\n社會的價值場域，是由無數烙印在你我意識裡的價值階級所交織而成（包含了文化傳統、科技催化、演化心理等因素）。它讓你每一天醒來都能輕鬆地踏進一個已知的世界，不必因為世界的複雜多變而感到焦慮無助，更使你能夠輕鬆地信任生活中無以計數的人事物——每一天，你知道陌生人會和你保持距離、你知道如何和同事或家人相處、你知道該期待在餐廳得到怎樣的服務、你知道公眾事務會一如往常地正確運作。在每一個或小或大的群體中，人們都受到某個共同的目標所指引、朝著某個共同的方向前進、實踐著某一套共享的價值階級。\n\n無論是家庭、公司、乃至整個國家，如果沒有廣受接納的信仰系統、沒有對群體目標的普遍共識、沒有至少一種多數人同意的價值階級，就不可能建立秩序、不可能有效分工並解決問題、不可能產生能夠指引人們去為自己和周遭他人創造更多安康的「生命藍圖」——一個社會所共享的價值和敘事，是無數前人歷經長時間的磨合、省思、與洗鍊後所得到的，關於人生的系統性解答。\n\n大自然如此殘酷無情、生命如此乖舛無常，如果我們以為人類可以拋開沉重的階級秩序、像童話故事裡的森林小動物般自由獨立、無憂無慮地生活，那實是對世界、對歷史、對人性都太過無知了。\n\n確實，社會奉行的秩序也可能替暴君背書、長久傳承的價值也可能迫害個人，但那既非任何社會秩序的初衷、更不是其運作健全的成果。我們舉目所見的社會價值和階級秩序，遠遠不是用來限制、壓迫個人自由的無謂枷鎖，而是人類在倉皇紊亂的世界裡，企圖為彼此的生命找到安定與意義的渺小努力。\n\n因此，在我們對各種形式的社會秩序提出批判之前，我們應當認清的事實是：無論宗教、傳統、倫理、或文化，這些價值階級所做的事情並非只是（許多人控訴的）將你形塑成適合嵌入社會整體裡的形狀，有甚於此，它們事先替你把整個社群形塑成了一個穩定互信、有跡可尋、使你能安心容身的地方。\n\n我們應當體認到自己每一天都如何受惠於人類社會歷經長遠歲月所積累的秩序，並以審慎積極的態度參與這個已為我們拓寬道路的世界。\n\n\n\n---\n\n註：\n\n1.

Despite the short term investing being a rough zero sum game, there’s still no real winning and losing behind each decision. One’s earnings could be a loss in certain perspective, one’s losing could be a win in another perspective. You simply don’t know why one buys or sells, so it’s impossible to determine the win and loss for others. Thus it’s impossible to answer the question whether an earnings is moral or not.\n\nAdding the company’s earnings and works into the equation, 2 people can invest at the same time and earn the same amount, while one spent lots of time researching but the other was simply following others blindly. You can argue maybe one person deserves the earnings more than the other, but essentially it’s impossible to determine the answer.\n\nThis is to hold each person accountable for his/her decision in the market. One is responsible for his decision in his investing and no one is capable of judging his economical behavior other than himself. Essentially the only win or loss is determined by the person.\n\nSame is applied in politics. We hold each person accountable for his decision in voting and everyone has the same vote, despite the difference in how they’re informed and educated and how much they’ve researched. We gave up the position to judge others decisions on any given topic only so we can make sure the capable people can have their voices heard, and in turn things can be bettered in turn of that. The individual freedom and free market creates this frame where one can affect the world in a positive way with maximum space and flexibility. This is the pillar of modern society.\n\nEssentially we need to accept that there’s no one answer for everyone if we want to enjoy the fruit of such belief manifesting in our society. We have to accept the fact that everyone can have the freedom to pursue their own answer and truth in their own way without anyone interfering. And the faith in that, in turn of everyone pursuing their own truth (instead of any supervisor assigning the tasks to them), we can make the society thrive.\n\nSo it’s not a proper way to view this world anymore in that we think there’s already an answer for everyone (totalatism, traditional religions, right wind conservatives don’t gel with this world view very well), or thinking one group of people have the answer for all (Marxism, post modernist, left wing). Instead we have to understand that people should be viewed as sovereign individuals so we can exploit the talent in people. However it’s also not proper to view the world that everyone can have this own answer and everything is relative, as nilhism is not helpful for the society to gain consensus and move toward an united direction.\n\n獨裁政權 vs 虛無主義\n  \n\nEchoed by Peter

[[神聖個人]]、[[道德]]、[[倫理學]]、[[政治]]、[[社會]]、[[價值]]、[[潛能]]\nref:\n[[個人德性的意義與責任]]\n\n---\n「神聖個人」的意思是，**人類世界裡最重要的單位是個人。個人之所以神聖，不是來自他身上既有的被動特質、未經檢驗的慾望索求、或隨波逐流的粗心言行，而是因為他擁有身而為人的重要潛能：行使理性、瞭解自我、敬天愛人、彰顯良善、生產創造、追求卓越。**\n\n每一個人都有獨一無二的經歷與可能性，但你我皆因具備這些潛能而神聖、應當受到社會群體的尊敬與重視、並且值得我們富有責任感地善待和灌溉自己——這需要我們拿出主動性、理性、道德、責任感、以及創造力去實現。\n\n所以，任何將個人尊嚴和主動性「降格」、草率地把自己或他人化約成沒有自主意識的標籤化單位的傾向，諸如受害者情結、群眾心理、道德勒索、威權主義、非黑即白的二元善惡觀等，我們都必須保持警覺，因為這些心理陷阱不僅會出現在他人身上，更可能自你我內心浮現。\n\n無論今天要進行關於法治、經濟、道德、正義、公平的討論，都該優先從「**擁有自由意志、能夠主動作為、富有創造力與影響力的個人**」出發。種族、宗教、性向、資產階級等其他社會單元和分類縱然有其論述的用途，但均不該凌駕個人的神聖重要性。唯有當我們戒慎但堅定地捍衛「神聖個人」的立場，才能避免重複落入歷史上無以計數的善惡對立、部落主義、威權統治、身份政治等泯滅個人以致釀成巨災的意識形態陷阱。\n\n「神聖個人」絕非淺碟的個人主義、粗暴地把個人願望昇華到一切之上，它更該富有道德、責任感、以及深刻的社群關懷，是超越了利己和利他、且能滲透到其他公眾議題討論的一種德性倫理學觀點。「神聖個人」是法律之前人人平等、無罪推定等重要法治原則的前提；是我們拒絕任何形式的物化、工具化他人的理據；是賦予政府有限權力、實踐民主政治的基石；更應該是社會中的每一個人對待彼此的根本信念。\n\n---\n\n我相信，東西方文明都指出了「神聖個人」的重要性，這絕非巧合，因為這是根本上正確的看待每個人的方式。為什麼呢？\n\n在我看來，我們只可能有三種看待每個人類個體的方式：\n\n\n## 第一，是相信個人毫無神聖性。\n\n這個觀點廣為流傳於受當代物質主義、新無神論、及虛無主義影響的知識份子及年輕世代。他們相信不存在著任何「神授」的人類價值、人類生命僅是宇宙中的意外事件、人生在根本上並無意義。奠基於這些「事實」，他們在價值上往往會朝類似道德相對論的立場靠攏，但不是因為他們覺得道德相對論真的很有道理，而是他們對於要在這個自由開放的時代裡採取篤定的道德立場感到很沒有安全感。更何況，優先亮出「支持自由多元開放進步」的「友善」牌照，不但能讓你避免被進步主義道德警察給獵巫，還可以獲得免費的道德點數。\n\n現代人雖然經常不樂意透過宗教或傳統的觀點去承認個人神聖性，但他們幾乎不可能不經由其他途徑去為自己的生命加諸意義、注入某種「絕對」的價值，所以很多人才會秉持著像是「問心無愧地活著」、「追求熱情」、「創造自己的人生意義」的信條在生活，或是為了安頓內心「意義真空」的焦慮、努力說服自己「我已經夠好了」。 \n\n換句話說，幾乎所有看似不相信個人神聖性的人，其實都用預設了個人神聖性的方式活著、努力將自己視為一個重要且積極的存在，他們只不過是特別排斥太文言或傳統的措辭罷了。但也因為缺乏對個人神聖性的深刻思索，他們難免會偶爾忘了這件事，進而疏於照顧和鞭策自己。\n\n至於真正相信個人毫無神聖性的人，[他們對此信念的實踐值得我們恐懼](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E7%BA%A6%E5%87%AF%E6%8B%89%E6%A0%A1%E5%9B%AD%E6%9E%AA%E5%87%BB%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6)，而那已經不是我們可以輕易拆解的問題。\n\n\n## 第二，是相信只有部分個人是神聖的。\n\n任何將世界看作為「善與惡的戰場」、並相信自己是「正義的一方」的人，都難以避免在某些時候選擇性遺忘了他人的神聖性，或根本直接全盤否定任何他們認定為「邪惡」的對象。一旦他們相信一個對象夠邪惡，一切是非對錯就可能被昇華到部落主義的聖戰層級，他們會拒絕任何形式的對話、甚至相信暴力是可以被合理化的。如果有關心過去五年的國內外新聞，上述現象可以輕易地在政治光譜的兩端看到不可勝數的例子。我們亦可由二戰以降的各種偶像崇拜、極權專制、對敵人的妖魔化宣傳所窺見。（推薦閱讀：《[好人總是自以為是](https://search.books.com.tw/redirect/move/key/Jonathan+Haidt/area/mid/item/0010669638/page/1/idx/4/cat/001/pdf/1/spell/3)》、《[為什麼我們製造出玻璃心世代?](https://search.books.com.tw/redirect/move/key/Jonathan+Haidt/area/mid/item/0010850061/page/1/idx/2/cat/001/pdf/1/spell/3)》）\n\n當你順從群眾、自命正義、將對立面視為寇讎，你不只抹滅了對方的人性，你其實也拋棄了自己作為神聖個人的「獨立思考」的主控權。換句話說，你可能正扮演著意識形態的棋子，受到操弄而毫不自知。\n\n你錯我對、敵惡我善的部落主義心態是如此易於流傳又難以抵抗，我們更有責任要善於自省、嚴己寬人、慎防群眾心理和意識形態的激情。已經有太多太多的歷史證據向我們顯示，任何以簡單善惡劃分敵我的二元觀點，都存在著走向極權專制、將公眾議題道德化、將異己去人性化、將暴力合理化的危險。\n\n大人世界裡的政治紛擾和是非爭端的解方，終究回到我們從小就耳熟能詳、長大卻拋諸腦後的基本道理：孔子說要反省自身、積極修為，君子根本無暇評斷他人；耶穌則訓誡我們要去掉自己眼中的樑木、不要論斷人，有資格審判人的只有上帝。無論你是否相信上帝，都不應該自認有資格勝任審判世人的工作、不應該過度自滿於你想為人類創造的烏托邦、不應該將所有與你相左的意見視為邪惡——這應是身而一個遠非完美的人類所該秉持的最基本的謙卑。\n\n至於另一種詮釋「只有部分個人是神聖的」的方式，是把自己歸類在毫無神聖性的那一邊。據我所知這只會有兩種可能性，一種是憂鬱症，另一種是極權社會主義國家。我應該不用說明為什麼兩者都不是好選項。\n\n\n## 第三，是相信每個個人皆是神聖的。\n\n我們每個人都想要被這世界視為一個擁有自由意志、能夠主動作為、富有創造力與影響力的積極存在。正因為我們都有創造的潛能、追求意義的需求、獨立自主的意志（或至少想要如此相信），所以當我們被視為沒有能力決定任何事情、沒有能力使自己和周遭他人變得更好、沒有能力為自己或他人創造價值的消極存在時，活著就變成了徹底空洞的消磨，甚至使人產生毀滅性的慾望。\n\n當你讓年幼的孩子在晚飯前幫忙擺放碗盤、並稱讚他做得很好，你便是肯定他「為世界帶來價值」的潛能，而沒有一個孩子會不喜歡這種「發現自己有能力將良善（Good）帶進世界」的感覺——這是讓我們最深刻地感覺到「我存在」的時刻之一。相對地，當你看著正值年少的兒女在那裡自怨自艾、覺得自己糟糕憂愁又不被愛時，你或多或少會因為他們對自己身上背負的潛能、創造力、及責任的徹底漠視感到生氣，因為你清楚地知道他們「不僅僅是如此」。\n\n同孩子一樣，我們也都在工作、感情、家庭等不同型態的群我關係中追尋著那份認可自我的意義，都想透過自身意志去施予和收受、去體驗「當人生舞台的主角」的那種踏實存在感。這是為什麼青少年討厭大人為他們做決定、把他們當成沒有能力思考的次等公民，也是為什麼家中長輩總在不被重視或越加虛弱的時候，試圖證明自己還可以為家裡貢獻點什麼、證明這個家仍然是需要他的。\n\n每個人都想要被視為有價值、有主動性的神聖個人，無論我們心裡是否清楚這點。一旦我們能夠深刻體認個人的神聖性，我們會更明白該如何引導自己的生命，並且有尊嚴地、盡力地善待自己和他人。\n\n---\n\n「神聖個人」強調的並不是每個人應享有的權利，而是指出每一個人都是足以挪動這世界、決定它傾往天堂或地獄的重要主體——個人的權利與幸福則會是承擔這個責任後的附帶品。個人神聖性的實踐，意味著毫無保留地發展一個人的理性、創造力、與道德力量，因此每一個人及其潛能都是不可忽視且舉足輕重的。\n\n值得澄清的是，「神聖個人」並不是天真的性善論。縱然我們瞭解每個人都有向善的潛能，也必須明白人性要投入邪惡並不困難。\n\n善與惡是一體的兩面，我們可以透過對惡的認識來推論善，也可以經由對善的理解去遠離惡。從惡的角度出發，可以參考Jordan Peterson對亞當夏娃偷嘗禁果的理解：人類意識到自己赤身裸體的脆弱，並發現其他人也具有相同的脆弱後，便能夠推導出「我可以用自己會被傷害的方式去傷害他人」的結論。從善的角度出發，可以參考孟子對人性向善的詮釋：他以「孺子入井」的故事，點出了我們不忍別人無故受苦的「惻隱之心」，相信人類具有無條件地關懷別人的道德能力和傾向。就科學的角度，鏡像神經元的發現則證實了上述的兩種理解。\n\n人性向善，但為惡亦在咫尺。從儒學、斯多葛主義，到善於書寫權力法則的[Robert Greene](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010868819?sloc=main)，都一在提醒我們克己復禮、善待他人的同時，切勿無知天真地縱容和輕信他人，而要保有明亮眼光與深刻智慧去判斷形勢、洞悉他人、明哲保身。若缺乏智慧又寧願保持無知，你便是任由自己流於被剝削利用的命運，而這顯然嚴重傷害了你的個人神聖性。\n\n因此，你有責任打理好自己的生活和身心，將自己視為值得被幫助的對象，盡可能不再為世界創造不必要的苦難。當你照顧好自己，你才會進一步有能力為自己和你所愛之人帶來幸福和慰藉。又即使在你沒有能力改變現狀、承受著無可避免的苦難時，你也最低限度能決定自己要用什麼姿態受苦。\n\n請記住，你為自己和周遭他人所帶來的任何一點安康，都絕非微不足道；你為減輕世上苦難所付出的任何一分努力，都絕非徒勞無功——我們身上都背負著這份不容忽視的潛能，以及實現這份潛能的責任。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E6%98%AF%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%9E%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2%E7%9A%84%E7%84%A1%E5%BD%A2%E5%8A%9B%E9%87%8F":{"title":"","content":"tags:

空有觀念而無系統\n\n用同一個類比反過來想：如果徒有好的地勢、卻無相對的溝渠能夠配合，雖然水能夠大致往一個正確的方向流，但就很難集中眾志、引導社會往同一個方向前進。換句話說，沒有好的系統、或甚至只有壞的（善行不被鼓勵、惡行受到獎賞）的系統，那麼一個有良好公德的社會或許頂多能夠撐得比其他人民普遍較自私的社會久一點，或者也可能能聰明地發明或融入能鼓勵獎賞好行為的社會機制來改良、平衡原本的機制（就像是日本和德國在資本主義下的職場文化和法制環境促成了對員工和職人的尊敬和照顧）。\n\n然而我們也不應該一切都寄望在道德教育上，因為一個難以直指的事實是，在設計一個讓人們參與的系統時，其往往就帶有某些或被彰顯、或未點明的道德前提和假設。當一個系統的規則本身鼓勵著特定的行為或特質、獎勵著特定的結果和作為、忽略甚至懲罰特定的行為或特質，那麼這很顯然就是一種帶有道德意含的律則，我們很難要求參加者能總是主動自己帶入某些沒有被遊戲規則所點名或獎賞的德性，甚至那些德性更有可能是讓參加者在遊戲中無法拔得頭籌的障礙。\n\n群體的觀念能夠反過來改良優化原本的系統、讓它運作得更順暢和長久，系統的遊戲規則本身也經常帶有一套道德的前提或假設、任何認真想參與的人都可能放大那套道德前提、甚至屏棄那些對於贏得遊戲沒有幫助（但可能是好的）的觀念。很顯然，我們需要兩者的配合、相輔相成，才能夠引領社會走向更美好共榮的境地，或至少避免公眾德性的腐敗和系統運作的崩壞。\n\n---\n\n在人類老祖先生活的史前時代，高熱量、高糖份的食物十分罕見，有機會遇到就該吃越多越好、將難能可貴的熱量儲存起來備用。時至今日，現代人因為熱量太容易取得、相同的演化習性卻沒有跟上時代，而得擔心肥胖、糖尿病等問題。\n\n演化上的眾多證據說明了人類的動物性往往是自利、短視、甚至暴力的，所以該令人詫異的是，人類為何也能成為理性、無私、和平且遠慮的動物？會是什麼，讓人類蛻變成有道德的自主個人、秉持犧牲的信念去思考和行為，進以建立文明、提升群體福祉？\n\n答案是科技。\n\n如果我們能夠理解，對於第一個發現尖銳樹枝可以作為狩獵工具的人類而言，那支樹枝就是「科技」，我們便可以取得一個簡單清楚的定義：**科技，就是人類在自身感官之外、有目的性地跟世界互動的方式。**\n\n科技與人類的攜手演進有交互的作用；我們雖是科技的發明者，但科技也反過來改變了人類與世界互動、進而看待世界和人類自己的方式。舉例來說，犁的發明大大提升農耕效率的同時，也因為圈養和鞭笞家畜的需要，削弱了狩獵採集時代的人類對其他動物之靈性的正視、開始了以人類為中心的宗教/世界觀。另一方面，農耕效率的提升讓聚落可以養活的人數增加，人數增加等同對外侵犯力的增加，使得其他聚落不得不採行這項科技以確保抵禦外敵的能力。農業聚落的人口增加，讓人類大規模合作的需求出現，成為國家的基礎、導致軍事的中心化/專業化、形成農業時代下各地興起的封建制度。\n\n\n**如果我們同意道德問題有好答案和壞答案的區別、也同意好答案必須最大程度地關心群體的跨期福祉，那麼我們就不可能否認，科技對於道德的促進或減損往往有明確的傾向；我們不可能忽視科技背後的道德意涵及責任。**\n\n由摩爾定律驅動的當代指數型科技，其成長之快速迫使我們正視各項科技背後的「前提」。一旦前提設定偏頗，我們就會看到自由市場的競逐將如何以最有效率的方式、最大化錯誤的指標——最顯著的實例莫過於社群媒體：為求互動率、吸住人們的目光，社群媒體一個個成為政治謠言、激化對立、同溫層、上癮行為的溫床。可參考紀錄片《The Social Dilemma》。\n\n\n\n\n若檢視科技演進的歷程，我們會發現科技在很多時候遠非特定發明家或企業家的自主意識產物，而更像是在特定時空背景下必然會發生的事件——就算沒有愛迪生，燈泡也遲早（已經）被其他同時代的人發明；就算沒有祖克柏，也肯定會有其他類似臉書的產品在社群媒體當道的時代裡被做出來。\n\n科技像是個潛伏於人類集體意識底層、一個有自主意識的神秘聲音，會在對的時間、在對的人（或人們）耳邊低語某個關鍵的靈感，企圖引領我們朝某個不得而知的方向前進。如果對於這點不能理解，我會推薦Kevin Kelly的《[科技想要什麼](https://www.thenewslens.com/article/144474/fullpage)》：\n\n\u003e歷史上大多數的時刻，大多數人看到豐饒文明中累積起來的可能性才會讓他們變得更好。這就是為什麼我們創造出文明／科技。這就是為什麼我們有工具。科技和工具帶給我們選擇，包括變好的選擇。\n\u003e\n\u003e如果我們無法放大其他人的機會，就會縮減他們的機會，這是不可原諒的缺失。因此，為其他人擴展創造力的規模，是我們的責任。我們擴展科技體的機會，發展出更多科技，用更多共榮同樂的方法表現科技，就能擴展其他人。\n\n但科技可不只是「發明」而已。從更深更廣的文明角度來看，**科技更是形塑人類歷史的、無形但真正關鍵的力量**：\n\n- 農業革命，使人類脫離定期遷徙、與自然共處的生活，產生累積財富、保障安全的需求，進而發展私有財產、法制、武士階級（武力的中心化）、專業分工等觀念——最後毫不巧合地在同一時期的世界各地形成了封建制度。\n- 槍械的發明，讓原需數千數萬個小時精實訓練的武士階級，被受過簡單槍械使用訓練的士兵所取代。武力不再被特定階級所獨占，轉而取決於哪個國家可以花比較多錢、將夠多槍械放進懂得開槍的兵士手中——中心化的國家政府成為比封建制度更合理的解答。\n- 印刷術的出現，更是直接或間接導致了宗教革命（將原是奢侈品的聖經抄寫本交到了大眾的手中）、文藝復興、知識和資訊的傳播和累積——於是科學得以蓬勃發展；新聞業（始於報紙）則強化了國民的自主意識，民主制度的接著出現也就無須絲毫意外。\n- 同理，我們也可以推論出工業革命如何催生了市場經濟（且與民主體制難分難捨）、避孕工具如何催生了性別革命。縱使是那些企圖把自己排除在西方思潮外的國家（如中國），也都不得不在迎接硬體科技革新的同時，一定程度地轉變其社會上運行的作業系統——拒絕擁抱更強大的科技，等於置自己國民的安康、和國家的競爭力於不顧。（就連樂意讓人民生活於水生火熱之中的北韓，都知道要嚷著核武才可能讓自己留在談判桌上。）\n\n換句話說，我們經常以為歷史事件的主使者是那些大名鼎鼎、與眾不同的標誌人物，但更多時候，他們只是科技力量的代理人——就算我們回到過去消滅馬克思及其同夥、抹除所有共產主義的相關資訊，在當時資本社會的熱烈發展下，產生出另一種神似共產主義的思想大概只是時間的問題。同樣地，女性主義在特定時空背景及科技驅使下遲早是要出現的，就看我們將其歸功於誰；中國就算沒有鄧小平，也大概會有其他人在那個時間點跳出來主張類似改革開放的政策。\n\n說到這裡，可能讓讀者摸不著頭緒了：所以這是在說，人類只是科技力量的傀儡？歷史上特定個人行善或為惡的作為大可被忽略？個人生在任一時空背景下都是毫無主動性的？那麼前面扯了這麼多我們該對群體跨期福祉的關心及努力，又有何意義？\n\n\nStepping stones\n- 就算燈泡必然會被發明，共產、資本、女性主義總會用某種方式誕生在世界上，也不代表我們沒有愛因斯坦也一樣能製造出核子武器、沒有甘迺迪也一樣能平安度過古巴危機。有些事件是洪流中必將出現、特定人物只是劇中角色的必然，有其他事件是歷史上幾無可能用其他方式重現的關鍵轉捩。\n- 就因為我們不總是歷史上具備主動性的創造者，不代表人類只是科技力量的傀儡、我們的道德主動性在歷史洪流的宿命論下微不足道。相反地，正因為科技力量及其伴隨而來的許多多極陷阱是如此難以跨越，我們更加需要有意識的個人為群體的跨期福祉有所努力，這種努力許多時候並不是參與既有的遊戲、企圖從遊戲中創造改變，而更可能是破壞性、顛覆性的作為，甚至利用某種仍在萌芽階段的新科技去顛覆既有體制中已經無法回頭的趨勢。對，科技力量勢不可擋，也因此每一個個人如何操使這份一步步逼近上帝的強大科技力，現在遠比歷史上的其他時刻都來得更加關鍵。\n- 我們並不是科技力量的傀儡，但我們也不該天真地以為科技只是我們的工具。人類與科技是個共同且「交互」進化的關係；科技賦予我們越加龐大的力量、及這份力量帶給我們的挑戰，某種程度上幾乎可說是上帝對人類智慧的考驗。這個故事從夏娃偷嘗禁果的那一刻便上演到今天——在歷史的某一刻，人類發現能有效獵殺動物的武器也可以用來殺傷自己的仇敵，而今天我們對核子武器的擔憂則是相同的問題、但升級到了全球浩劫的等級。\n- 所以我們藉以「校準」自身行動的是非善惡，決定了我們與科技的關係——如果被缺乏智慧與遠見的動物性所驅使，我們就即有可能淪為科技力量的傀儡，讓人類成為名為「科技」的神祇在世界上恣意妄為的手段；如果我們能懷抱智慧與遠見、用理性和信念去操使科技力量，我們便有機會用超越科技發明的「硬體」所定義的方式，去運行社會群體的內心底層的「軟體」，扭轉逐底競爭的必輸賽局。（像是日本以其獨有的文化去操使現代科技和自由經濟資本主義，他們在文化的根本層面上、「自主地」刻意節制自身對當前/短期利益的追求，有意識地建立由信任、遠見、永續、精益求精等「美德」所驅使的一套獨有的資本主義自由經濟，並在全球經濟中獨樹一幟，難以被取代。）\n- 對，我們沒辦法基於對人類美德的信念而放棄核武、因為世界上總可能有國家會偷留一手對付他人，所以很遺憾我們不可能不將某部份的國家預算用在軍事上，但這不代表我們就一定要跟所有人廝殺到底、血流成河。\n- 道德——即我們用來回應「應然」問題的作業系統——在這個時間點、且是人類前所未有地受制於自由市場經濟的多極陷阱中的時刻，才會尤其的複雜難解、又如此重要，而需要每一個個人認知到自己肩上的道德重任。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E9%9D%A9%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84%E6%B3%95%E5%89%87":{"title":"","content":"tags:

科技革新往往是漸進的。大眾通常只記得、也只為那些看似天外飛來的創新驚呼，但他們只是沒有關注相關領域的發展、不曉得看似巨大的創新實是來自無數在那之前的微小演變與改良。\n2. 承1，人們對通常只記得、也對歷史上突出的發明家過譽了，因為創新通常不是發生在某個產品被發明或「行得通」的那一刻，而是某個產品被成功地降低成本、提高生產、並大量地送到消費者手中的那一刻（NASA將太空人送上月球縱然很了不起，但真正對人類歷史更大的影響得等到普羅大眾能夠支付太空旅行的那一天）。\n3. 承1，科技革新來自微小的演變和改良，更仰賴企業家和技術人士的「觸類旁通」、抓住一閃而逝的微小契機並傾注資源將之化為現實——Yahoo和Google的創辦人一開始的目標都不是要創造「搜尋引擎」、Twitter的創辦人一開始則是想發明讓人們找到Podcast的方式。創新往往是意外發現的產物。\n4. 承1，科技革新更多是用正確的、市場能夠欣賞的方式「重組」了某些已經存在的功能、服務、或產品——發明汽車的人並不需要也發明輪子、彈簧、和鋼鐵。只要在夠多人口、市場夠熱絡的地方，我們就能發現這些創新。\n5. 科技革新需要反覆試驗及除錯。大多數的企業家都不會成功，因為大多數的創新都不會一推出就成功、一被發明就運作無虞、毫無瑕疵。\n6. 科技革新是團隊運動。大眾心目中的天才發明家、不世出的科技奇才等英雄主義想像，通常都是不足的。承上，一個發明家或許能讓某個東西「行得通」，但要將這個產品送到大眾的手上，需要遠遠更多人的才智和專業。\n7. 科技是勢不可擋的。\n   1922年，哥倫比亞大學在同一時間紀錄到148件由不同人們提出、但幾乎一模一樣的發明，這顯示了科技的革新是歷史上的某種必然。不同人在同一時間發明出同一個產品，比較像是常態而非偶然。科技產物幾乎像是特定背景下結出的、即將成熟落地的果實；我們可以說搜尋引擎幾乎不可能不在1990年代被發明，燈泡幾乎不可能不在1870年代被發明。\n   有趣的是，這幾乎離奇地點出了人類在科技演進中的無足輕重，該出現的東西就是會出現，或許會晚一點、或許會換個名字或樣式，但它們終究會被發明。\n   當我們回顧過去，我們會覺得特定的科技創新是再理所當然不過的事；當我們展望未來，我們卻壓根不可能做出任何不會貽笑大方的預測。\n   [[We Wrestle Not With Flesh and Blood, but Against Powers and Principalities]]\n8. Amara's Law指出：人們通常高估了一項新科技在短期的影響，而低估了它在長期的影響（關於個人發展，人們也經常有同樣的高估短期、低估長期的傾向）。我們因此應該企圖思考一項新科技可能會有的[[二階效用(2nd order effect)]]甚至更多，尤其在設計一個新的、有潛力影響許多人的科技產物時。\n9. 科技革新偏愛去中心化治理。帝國通常不太善於創新；裡頭那些富裕有學識的菁英通常更樂於捍衛既得利益、抗拒新事物、將資源投注於奢侈品、戰爭、貪污，而非事業。近一千年來，科技革新不成比例地大量發生於城市中、尤其是那些自治的地區。\n---\n10. 科技革新讓我們能使用更少的資源。我們現在能使用更少的水產出更多的食物，更少的燃料航行更長的里程，更少的電力撥通更遠的通訊，更少的鋼鐵建造更多的建築……2008年以後的十年裡，美國每年以15%的程度成長、能源消耗卻以每年2%的速度下降，這就是因為科技的革新。科技革新使我們能用更少的資源提升更多人的生活品質，成長可以是永續的。\n    Comment: \n    This one essentially contradicts Jevons paradox.

Kirk）\n\n如果有個人說要跟你玩一個叫做「你想要怎樣都可以」的遊戲，你肯定會非常困惑、搞不懂這個遊戲的意義在哪——當一個遊戲不具有任何的疆界和規則時，那就根本沒有遊戲可玩。\n\n同理，人與人的合理互動——加總起來，就是社會整體的運作——必是建立在最根本的、被人們共同遵守、相互制約的律則之上。而我相信所有人都會同意，在最理想的情況下，這套律則應該是大家都有共識、而且樂意主動投入的。\n\n---\n# 秩序必然先於正義和自由\n\n首先，讓我們看看作家余杰[對於秩序的論述](https://rightpoint.site/column-yujie-kirk-210909/)：\n\n\u003e**「秩序」一詞意味著一種系統的和諧機制——不管是指向個人品格還是共同體。而且「秩序」的內涵也包括在共同體中履行特定的義務和享有特定的權利，因此才有了「公民社會秩序」的說法。** \n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e在被譽為「美國保守主義之父」的政治哲學家拉塞爾．柯克看來，比民主和自由更重要的、美國的第一關鍵詞乃是「秩序」。他認為，**秩序是靈魂的第一需要。除非我們認可某些約束自身的秩序原則，否則便不可能愛我們當愛之物。秩序是共同體的第一需要。除非我們認可借以實現正義的某些秩序原則，否則便不可能與他人和諧相處。** 靈魂的「內在秩序」和社會的「外在秩序」是緊密相連的，柯克警告說：「**如果美國人缺乏很好的個人道德秩序，法治便不可能在美國佔主導地位。如果缺乏有序的政治模式，美國人的個人品德便會墮落到毀滅性的自我中心之中**」。\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e人類社會最可怕的狀態不是極權主義而是無政府狀態。柯克談及一位從俄羅斯流亡到美國的學者向他講述的布爾什維克革命，那位流亡者通過那些恐怖事件逐步認識到**秩序必然先於正義和自由**。布爾什維克奪權後，此人逃到黑海邊上的敖德薩。當時，這座城市正處於無政府狀態。由年輕人組成的匪幫挾持了室內有軌電車，在市中心肆無忌憚地向行人開槍，就像獵殺鴿子一樣。居民的公寓隨時會被某一罪犯或瘋子入侵，他們僅僅為了一片麵包而殺人。在這種無政府狀態中，正義與自由只是美麗的詞彙。他痛定思痛地說：「我當時得到的教訓是，在我們享有正義和自由之前，我們必須要有秩序。我儘管非常痛恨獨裁者，那時卻認為極權政治再可怕，也比無序好。很多人可能會在極權制度中活下來，卻無人能在普遍的無序中倖存」。\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e柯克還說：「一旦基督教信仰為某個民族普遍接受，那麼，任何政治安排都會受到基督教有關道德秩序的教義的影響。這一道德秩序會作用於政治秩序。基督教有關正義、仁愛、共同體和義務的觀念可能會在不急速改變政府架構的情況下轉化一個社會。個人的價值、上帝面前人人平等的觀念，以及對所有世俗權威的限制——這些都將塑造美利堅共和國的基督教信念」。\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e歷史學家波特霍夫所說：「美國社會史有力地說明，**如果人們顛覆或拋棄內含於設計得很好的制度結構中的價值觀，並因此拆毀文化成就與精神平和的社會根基，他們將將自己置於極大的危險之中**」。\n\n從更常識性的角度看，秩序之所以先於正義和自由，是因為我們數萬年來身處其中的自然世界，對人類的渺小生命實是非常殘酷暴虐的。要消滅一大批人類，只消用上一點氣候驟變或猛獸侵襲即可。無怪乎各大宗教都在在告誡我們，生命的本質是苦、世事總是無常。\n\n顯見，秩序是人類建立文明、改善生活、確保安康的必要途徑，它引領了大部分人的生命、保全了社會的完整與安穩。我們不可能否認秩序帶來了你我今天生活的這個世界。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%AB%8B%E5%BF%97%E6%96%BC%E4%BD%A0%E8%83%BD%E8%A8%AD%E6%83%B3%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E5%B4%87%E9%AB%98%E7%9B%AE%E6%A8%99":{"title":"","content":"tags:

to)」，並依內心的答案去行動。\n\n設定最崇高的目標，能幫助我們長期保持方向的正確，避免失焦於眼前的成果、利益、或困境。將目標設定得夠高、並納入關於自己及他人的思考，我們才能夠在日常的每一個行動中確認自己是否真的為長遠、為自己、為群體著想，而不是執著於當前的好處或考驗，而做出可能會在長期下傷害我們、或傷害其他我們所在乎的人事物的決定。**設想最崇高目標，我們才可能在個人、家庭、職場、社會等各個層次裡都盡可能達成一致方向、避免目標衝突所導致的失衡和失落。**\n\n在工作上，要釐清一個目標是否夠「好」，我們只需衡量它是否符合KPI、迎合老闆的喜好、能替公司帶來效益，但如果我們思考自己在職場上的最「崇高」目標，這會無可避免地帶入他人、以及你和他人之間的關係，那會是你的同事、下屬、或客戶。這個道德上的思辨將迫使我們跨越「獨善其身」的範疇、踏進「相善其群」的領域，而這個「群」更有可能遠遠超過你所處的辦公室或甚至公司本身。這個思考也幫助我們釐清自身工作的真正使命、讓我們看見自己日復一日的勞動之於這個世界究竟有何意義。\n\n作為一位基層人員，你的工作之於身邊他人、公司、客戶乃至這個世界的真正意義是什麼？作為一名主管，你是否能為公司、為上司、乃至為你的下屬創造更多的、勝過每月營業獎金的價值？作為一個企業主，你能為公司的每一位同仁、以及社會大眾帶來什麼比你的商品或服務還要更可貴的東西？許多時候，這些問題的答案並不會圍繞著你所能給予他人的好處或方便，而是關於你如何看待與對待他人、你自己、還有你與他人之間的關係。\n\n離開職場、走入家庭與社會，這樣的思考更貼近我們的生活，也因此更加必要：你希冀的家庭是什麼樣子？你想像自己在那個家庭中的狀態為何？你期待家庭成員們用怎樣的方式共處？你希望你的兒女長成怎樣的人？你希望人們如何看待你與你的家庭？你所設想的家庭能否共體人生的苦與樂，無論安康或顛沛都能相互扶持？然後，在這些想像底下，你是否清楚自己必須成為怎樣的人，才有機會使這一切化為現實？\n\n於是，在職涯、家庭的目標之上，我們勢必得再更深一層、釐清自己對生命本身的想法：你重視什麼價值？你最在乎的事物是什麼？你希望在他人心目中留下什麼評價？你期許自己過著怎樣的生活？你有什麼未能伸展的志向或待完成的夢想？最令你感受到生命意義的是什麼？這些問題的答案又如何引領你為自己訂下職涯、家庭、以及其他生活面向上的目標？\n\n在這裡，每一層的思考、每一層的目標訂定都毫不容易，需要我們誠實地探索自己的經驗與內心才可能抽絲剝繭。關於生命的思索絕非形而上的賣弄玄虛，我們看待人生的方式總會以非常實際的方式顯露於一言一行當中、深入生活的每一個角落。**抗拒思考並不是個替代方案，因為當你的內心缺乏洞見、觀點模糊，你的行動就會欠缺明確動機、難以直指目標，那就像矇著眼睛丟出飛鏢，丟不丟中什麼都是任由命運宰制。** 更別說生命如此複雜，每一個面向都存在著許多值得追求的目標、以及需要避免的困境，若未釐清真正引領你前進的價值及其排序，我們便很可能某一天驚覺自己在家庭、事業、個人身心等面向上都充滿對立和相互衝突的需求，而屆時已難以平衡。\n\n當然，訂定目標不是萬靈丹，它既不會替我們排除生命中的任何問題、也可能不會照著我們規劃的藍圖前進，而這也是為什麼我們需要探問這些更高層次、更困難的人生問題。建立在現實條件上的目標總有可能失落、意外總有可能發生、時間越長就只會有越多不確定性；但建立在價值之上的目標和洞見則相反，它們會在你墜落時撐起你、在你得意時警醒你，並隨著時間越長、你越瞭解自己後，帶給你日益澄澈的眼光。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E7%BD%AA%E8%AB%96":{"title":"","content":"tags:

齊克果\n\n罪並非是道德議題，Anti-Climacus指出，一個認識神的人，或是有神的觀念的人，如果他絕望於不願做他自己或是絕望於要做他自己，這二者的表現都是罪。\n\n當人認識到他的自我是直接立於神面前的自我之時，就不再是從人的標準來衡量自我，而是，這個自我將具有新的質，並且也要繼續從新的方面來發展這個自我。當人認識這個新的自我的可能性，卻對這個自我絕望，不願成為這個該有的自我之時，齊克果稱之為罪，那正是在神面前的「不信」。「罪」在此前提之下其同義詞就是「不信」，或者說其反義詞就是「信」。這也是基督教信仰本質的根本。因此，從齊克果的觀點，惟獨人立於神面前才可能知罪，基督教的罪觀當從此論起。\n\n人的過錯之所以稱為罪， 是因為人在神面前而顯出其犯罪意識。這意識是不願讓神的旨意成為他自己的意願，也就是不願意順服神之意。而所論的這意識，並非指存心在道德上犯什麼過錯，而是，他知道自己活在神面前，卻對自我絕望，不願成為神手中的自我。Anti-Climacus這樣的定義並非要避開人在道德上所犯的過錯的問題，而是他看到，人之所以不同於其他受造物，首先在於人是靈，是時間與永恆的綜合。永恆終究要向人的存在發問，人終究要單獨立於永恆面前交代他的一生。Anti-Climacus這種從存在的絕望定義罪的觀點，直接與人是「靈」的特性相關，突顯出人對神的回應之必需。 因此Anti-Climacus論述，罪也是意志的問題。由此，Anti-Climacus批判蘇格拉底對罪的定義。蘇格拉底認為「罪是無知」，但Anti-Climacus予以反駁，提出基督教所論的罪不在於知識層面，而在於意志。在於人不願意順服神、至善。但是蘇格拉底的觀點也有對的部分，因為，人若真知道順服神旨意的好處，他也就不會違背了。悖論的是，人處在不順服／罪之中，他無法了解順服神的好處，也不認為自己是在罪中。惟獨藉著「信」，就是神所給的條件才得以知。這恰恰是引起許多人惱怒的觀點。從這個層面可以說，「罪是無知」。但一個人如果已經信了神，從神的聖言知道罪是什麼，卻在神前絕望於不願做他自己或絕望於定意做他的自己，這就真是罪了。\n\n\n​​此概念很類似Victor Frankl認為我們不該探問生命的意義為何，因為我們才是被提問的人，並且應該用自己的行動去作為此問題的回應。[[Viktor Frankl Self-Actualization is not the

Passing]]\n[[社會的價值階級]]\n\n---\n\n我們都知道現今世界上的共和政體，大多以行政、立法、司法的三權分立作為支柱，並賦予地方分治的權力以制衡中央。在原則上，這可以避免任何國家事務走向專制。\n\n然而在英國——這個特殊的君主立憲國家——存在著行政、立法、司法之外的第四個部門，亦即皇室本身座落的「象徵」部會。\n\n國家的「象徵」部會，其功能就是作為凝聚民族、團結國家的代表。在純粹的理念上，那可以是中華民國的三民主義、中國的中國共產黨章程、或美國的獨立宣言，但國旗、國歌、甚至其他重要的文物、建築、祭典、特有動植物等等，都可以是具備「國家象徵」的功能。\n\n如果我們回顧歷史，不難發現許多國家領導者（包含現在）在獲得國家的實質統治權之後，若無其他勢力與之抗衡，他們經常會更進一步想證明自己手上的權力是「上天的授予」、證明自己是「天選之人」、企圖使自己成為國家在象徵意義上的代名詞。有些甚至索性扭曲體制、讓自己當上貨真價實的皇帝。\n\n但「象徵」的功能究是什麼？要回答這點，我們就必須了解到人類有著「向典範看齊」的原始驅力。\n\n我們經常不自覺地為上流人士、企業老闆、或好萊塢明星貼上「高道德標準」的標籤，而當他們的私生活顯示出他們的德性並沒有高人一等時，人們會相當氣憤失望。在國家的層面上，我們也一樣將某種形式的「典範」投射在領導人、甚至其配偶身上。所以即便男性總統的伴侶（如美國的「第一夫人」）沒有政治實權，這個角色卻往往具備了安定人心、體察民意的多重心理意義（或至少許多人對這個角色抱有這種期待）。\n\n凝聚國家的「象徵」，必須是某種比個人更崇高、值得景仰、甚至神聖莊嚴的理想，而對於國民來說，我們需要見到能夠體現這些理想的典範，進以具體地支撐我們對國家的認同感。舉例而言，許多台灣人之所以懷念蔣經國和孫運璿時代的人物，正是因為這些人的操守和貢獻（在他們眼中）完整體現了國家理想及民族精神，所以他們是人民的典範。\n\n話說回來，英國王室的存在——縱然是歷史上的巧合——巧妙地將國家的「象徵」部會獨立於政治之外，使之成為一個難以被權力鏽蝕的、凝聚國家的純粹典範。 更遑論，應該沒什麼人敢說伊莉莎白女王——這位看盡近代歷史、歷經政治波瀾、共事過15位總理的當代傳奇——在這個重要位置上的表現差強人意。\n\n作為對比，努力將自己打造成「美國精神代言人」、而且在一定程度上成功做到這點的川普，其支持者經常狂熱地揭示著有美國國旗的裝扮，而反川派也相應地出現了敵視、甚至焚燒國旗的舉動——這些現象都在在顯示川普成功佔據了美國的「象徵」部會，仇視他就（不得不）仇視他所代表的國家象徵。有趣的是，驕傲（或者該說以身為美國人而驕傲）的川普甚至沒有讓他妻子——依循慣例的「第一夫人」——發揮太多能作為國家典範的功能，這點就和歐巴馬相當不同。\n\n跟川普類似的現象，也發生在韓國瑜及其代言的「中華民國」派身上，所以一如大家所知的，這也引起不少人對於那些會用青天白日滿地紅填滿全身裝扮的韓粉感到相當反感。（在這裡我完全沒有批評川粉或韓粉的意思，只是指出這個政治現象。）\n\n據我所知，英國並沒有發生上述的現象，就是因為英國首相並沒有跟國家的象徵掛勾，所以人們對強森的好惡根本不會反映在國旗或其他英國相關的國家代表物之上。如果你是個痛恨強森的英國選民，你或許會想要焚燒他的畫像，但大概不會想到要燒英國國旗，因為英國國旗（在過去）代表的是女王，不是強森；就算強森想要，他也無法佔據這個代表英國的象徵地位。\n\n無論國家、宗教、或是其他企圖讓人類進行大規模合作的組織，都會需要某種凝聚眾人的理想，以及體現這種理想的典範。只消對人性有基本的認識，就會知道我們不可能期待人們（包含我們自己）基於純粹的理性、同理心、自利、或意識形態去建立信任、相互合作。某種超越理性的理想必須作為眾人的標的，引領人們朝同一個方向前進；若將理想與典範斥為迂腐迷信，實是對社會運作的過度簡化、俗世化、及唯物主義化。\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E8%A2%AB%E6%AD%A6%E5%99%A8%E5%8C%96%E7%9A%84%E7%95%B6%E4%BB%A3%E7%BD%AA%E6%83%A1%E6%84%9F":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Handbook（均為歐美紅藥丸社群視為聖經般的經典）、甚至經營過部落格寫類似的東西。雖然我停止接觸紅藥丸已經很多年了，我想我應該還是對紅藥丸的一些核心想法有清楚的認識，足以作為我評斷的基礎。當然，紅藥丸一流可以囊括太多太多的人，總是會有一些例子可以作為駁斥我的批評的反例，所以請瞭解我是以相對大方向、以一個曾經的紅藥丸奉行者去做評判。又當然，假如我真的已經離紅藥丸遠到這整篇文章其實都是在打稻草人，那也就請看倌莫見怪了。\n\n---\n我不喜歡紅藥丸的三個最大的原因：\n\n**第一，紅藥丸只提供了問題的一半解答，並刻意忽略了另一半。**\n\n紅藥丸對人類天性的研究透徹，但他們的策略是「瞭解藉以抗衡」，而不是選擇「**瞭解藉以整合**」。\n\n就像是民主政治裡，永遠都會有人（甚至是大多數人）把民主機制當成最粗淺的部落主義來操作，也永遠有政治人物會選擇用民粹的作法滿足個人利益而非公眾福祉。在政治上，原始人性同樣用難以掩藏的方式展現著。\n\n在公眾政治上，對抗這種現象最好的方式，不僅是更加把握自己手上的選票，更要勇於對話、傾聽，並盡力提供更深層的思考機會（亦即教育）。\n\n縱使社會上永遠都會有部落主義和人性貪婪在運作，正確的公民意識也會告訴我們不該放棄自己選票的神聖性、也不該放棄與自己同屬一個社會裡的其他人的權益。與其去評判他人是否跟自己同為有意識的公民、或是愚昧的大眾，我們更該瞭解到大家都是身在同一個社會裡，千百樣的人們縱然有不一樣的看法，但終究要學會瞭解彼此並共同生活，所以我們不應該放棄對話、不應該輕易地將他人視為需要被對抗的外人，因為同在一個社會裡，我們沒有人是外人。\n\n但在紅藥丸裡，他們選擇的方式是瞭解了女人的天性之後，起身對抗它。對抗的方式是各式各樣的game、和其他被貼上「自我提升」標籤的周邊。\n\n我無法接受的是，**紅藥丸作為抗衡女人天性、以及女性主義和傾斜過多的性平運動，它們也容許自己成為部落主義、身份認同政治的溫床**——亦即他們最看不順眼的左派政治正確運動的最大驅力。\n\n無可避免地，紅藥丸為了抗衡後現代性別觀點、以正現代男性的視聽，他們將自己樹立為相反的陣營，這我當然可以理解。但我認為他們沒有負起更大的責任，因為他們作為大力抨擊左派政治的陣營，卻沒有讓自己超越部落主義、超越純粹地「抗衡勢力」。也因此，他們的論述往往停留在男性和女性作為相對陣營，僅教導男性如何看清不同於後現代性別觀點的現實、並提供抗衡女人天性的對策，但他們沒有再進一步踏出這個部落、沒有進一步瓦解紅藥丸內部的過分身份認同、引導每個男性活出屬於自己的生命，相反地，他們持續使用無法與其他觀點相容的方式在強化自己的封閉群體，而在華文界，許多紅藥丸推手透過付費訂閱、賣書、賣課程的手段去經營這些內容，更是讓這個幾乎異教式的群體進一步推向封閉。\n\n我一向認為，**如果紅藥丸的宣教者們是真心想要為當代男性開拓一個能擁有選擇、追尋自由、同時富足而有意義的人生，他們就必須做出更多的努力、踏出只是約會性愛和「自我提升」的象限，在紅藥丸的基礎上建立一套能夠真正引導當代男性的人生觀，並盡可能讓他們即早「畢業」、找到自己想要活的人生。** 但在我看來，他們花在這件事情上的力氣遠遠不比他們拿來批判兩性動態、享受約會性愛、還有為了「成為高價值男性」所做的自我提升活動來的多。\n\n同樣的，紅藥丸社群或許是抨擊女性主義和政治正確文化最不遺餘力的群體之一，你經常可以看到紅藥丸將當代男性在成長過程中缺乏「男性典範」這件事歸咎於嚴重失衡的兩性動態和文化左傾，然而我無法理解的是，**紅藥丸卻幾乎將所有的心力都投注在教導男人如何制衡女性、如何成為自己感情和性生活的主宰，但他們卻沒有花更多力氣去探索那麼我們究竟該如何重塑當代的男性典範。**\n\n所以當紅藥丸宣稱他們要將男人從迪士尼灌輸的愛情童話裡解放、要男人不在受困於真命天女症、將選擇權重新交回男人手中，我覺得奇怪的是，他們卻幾乎總是只討論把妹、轉盤子這個選項，而沒有回過頭來檢視一對一關係、甚至結婚生子這些人生選擇，彷彿一對一關係和結婚生子都是大家天生就會的，紅藥丸沒有更多可以補充了。建立在紅藥丸的基礎上，他們明明有機會為這些傳統的選擇補充非常多的論述、用嶄新的觀點來詮釋這些多數人終究會考慮的選項，但他們的心力卻總是放在始終只會有少數人選擇的把妹、一對多感情關係。\n\n也因此，在我看來，**紅藥丸根本預設人類就是總被演化心理驅使的動物，無論男性或女性，只不過他們不會這麼包裝，更不會讓已經買書買課程的你有產生這種感覺。** 他們提出一套讓被演化心理驅使著的男性——意味著男性會想做的就是擁有許多潛在配偶的選擇——可以成功去抗衡被演化心理驅使著的女性的方法。如今市場上流行的紅藥丸一流，其目的就是要幫助缺乏繁衍機會的當代男性能夠在苛刻的兩性動態下扳回劣勢，而所有的「自我提升」無非不是為了這個終極目的。\n\n我看不出來有什麼比這個更物化自我、藐視人類價值的觀點。\n\n---\n這就帶到了第二點。\n\n**第二，紅藥丸主張自我提升，但他們絕少真正面對不完美、也不可能完美的自己。**\n\n自我提升可能使你成為高價值男性，但你終究會是個不完美、帶著缺陷的人類。紅藥丸未曾討論作為一個不完美的人類，你應該用什麼姿態、什麼心態去和另一個不完美的人類互動。\n\n紅藥丸學說裡只告訴你如何提升自己、提升你在女人眼中的價值、進而成為兩性動態裡的主導者，但他們卻不會回過頭來看清楚我們每一個男人也同樣是如何有缺陷且脆弱的動物。\n\n你只會一股腦地覺得自己在成為強者、成為高價值，但忘了面對自己的缺陷和脆弱，進而看清「正因為你的不完美，你需要的不是成為更完美的自己、進而找到完美的伴侶，而是要找到一個她的優點和缺陷都能與你契合、啟發你、砥礪你的人」。\n\n**Your flaws need a match.**\n\n**紅藥丸教你如何擁有選擇，但他們不曾教你如何選擇。** 你或許以為你該選擇的伴侶是你所可以找到最美或最有性吸引力的女人、或者你偏好比較不膚淺的答案像是個性合得來、有很多話聊之類的，但除了這些，**你更要追尋一個幸福和困難的平衡**。\n\n你會要你和你的另一半相處起來有夠濃烈的幸福感來讓你有足夠的好理由保持一對一關係，但同時你該追求一個能適時地看清楚你的不完美、敢於挑剔你、甚至勇於開啟爭論的人。你不是個完美的人，就算靠你自己、或你在網路上結識的「自我提升」社群，也幾無可能引領你去成為你將在一個充滿深度、追求共同成長的一對一關係裡真正蛻變成為的自己。\n\n所以你會需要有個人能夠對你的缺失進行適時批判、讓你獲得智慧或至少不再犯蠢、讓你一點一滴砥礪成你所能夠成為的更好的自己。也因此，**你不可能總是在兩性關係中企圖當個「強者」，因為在真正坦白誠實的感情關係裡，你要的是能夠與你共同成長的另一半，而不是讓自己變成一個跟弱者在一起的人。**\n\n比起當強者、擁有感情裡的主導權、讓自己保持能夠「轉身離去」的姿態，你更該反觀自己是否謙遜地邀請對方對你提出批評、是否願意接納對方進入你的生命以成就你成為更好的人。如果你覺得這個建議令你困惑、或是令你懷疑「這難道不就是叫我回去當個對女人言聽計從的Beta嗎」，那可差得遠了，因為你在選擇伴侶的第一步，就是該找到一個你誠心期望她成為更好、而她也願意使你成為更好的人，而不是你們彼此都在關係中企圖從對方身上掠奪自己想要的東西。**你們彼此都需要為使對方成為更好的人而努力。**\n\n所以，成為強者、享有更多選擇，固然是個值得努力的目標，但你更應該看清楚自己是誰、有什麼優勢和劣勢、並了解到**跟你契合的人絕不會是你心中的理想對象，因為你從來就未是你理想的自己。** 相反地，**真正跟你「契合」的人將會令你驚訝，因為他們不僅是符合你想要的、擁有你想要的特質，他們更會在他們的弱點、缺陷、不安全感、甚至創傷裡跟你找到共鳴，然後激發你成為那個你不曉得你能夠成為的自己。**\n\n用一個誠實的眼光看待人類，是要看到每個人的可愛和可憐/可憎實是一體的兩面。就像小孩的可愛之處之一，就是因為他們如此的脆弱；女人的可愛之處，許多時候也正是他們會令你抓狂的地方。**你沒辦法只想要人類的理想特質、卻不要他們同時帶著的缺陷和脆弱，因為你自己就不是這樣運作的人類，更遑論他人。**\n\n了解你自己作為一個不完美的人類，你才不會在活在自己的強者泡泡裡，既批判自己也輕視別人。相反地，你才能誠摯地接納自己、愛自己，進而學會去欣賞同樣不完美、但也因此可愛的他人。\n\n---\n**第三，紅藥丸只提供了短期的解答，且無意回答長期的問題**\n\n我幾乎沒有看過紅藥丸的宣教者告訴我們，「紅藥丸之後」的人生應該長怎樣。是啊，有了紅藥丸你就的確有了選擇，擁有更大的自由和可能性，但然後呢？\n\n或許紅藥丸宣教者大多很享受「轉盤子」的生活、也能將自己的生活照顧得很好，但他們的追隨者呢？當你為女人的天性感到憤慨或不諒解、想要也走上那些紅藥丸大師的「轉盤子」之路時，你有想過這輩子要用什麼方式過完嗎？我相信大多數接觸到紅藥丸的人，其實都還是對自己的人生抱著結婚生子的期待——如果紅藥丸還沒有荼毒你到連這種人生風景的想望都剝奪走的話。\n\n**我討厭紅藥丸選擇停滯的地方——一個人自己的身上。** \n\n他們沒有繼續前進，他們遠遠沒有花像樣的力氣去討論一個人對於家庭、社會的責任，他們沒有讓你知道「紅藥丸之後」的風景應該長怎樣。一切都只停滯在你自己身上，只停留在你要如何滿足你自己，只停留在你要如何提昇自己以獲得更多你想要的東西。他們沒有告訴你在你三十五歲甚至四十歲之後，你應該拿你的人生怎麼辦。他們沒有告訴你在你賺飽了錢、幹夠了妹子之後該做什麼。如果你從頭到尾都沒有想要過著四處把妹的風流生活，他們能給你的建議也十分有限。\n\n人是會成長的，男人會，女人也會。世界上有花花公子轉成為愛家好男人，也有婊子轉成為忠心的賢妻良母。這種人多嗎？不多。但真正會成長、成熟、追求進步並承擔責任的人，本來就很少。\n\n紅藥丸做得很成功的，是讓參與者充分地覺得自己走在邁向「強者」的路上，但成為「強者」的目的究竟是什麼，我似乎沒有看到。他們會很籠統地說，你可以有選擇的自由、可以做你想做的、活你想活的人生，然後呢？一個人就會很快樂？我相信還差得遠呢。\n\n對於二十到三十出頭歲的男性，紅藥丸只是一個對短期問題的快速解答（那些到了中年才被女人搞砸人生的男人，就稍微不幸了一些）——無論他們將自己包裝得多麼革命性、多麼了不起到你的人生都會徹底不一樣。\n\n一對一關係、結婚生子、長期相處，難道是這麼簡單的事情，簡單到紅藥丸社群對這些沒有什麼好補充的嗎？難道紅藥丸能夠接受現在市面上的一對一感情建議、婚姻建議都已經很棒了他們一點意見都沒有嗎？他們也可曾提到過當你的父母親遭受病痛、甚至你自己的生活面臨磨難時，應該如何尋求你手上正轉著的「盤子們」來幫助你嗎？他們可曾告訴大家說為什麼穩定的一對一關係、甚至一個能夠扶持你的妻子，可以支持你度過多少你自己一個人難以跨越的人生苦難？他們對於當代男性應該立志成為怎麼樣貌的父親，有什麼建議嗎？\n\n**抗衡異性終究是個短期求偶問題的快速解答，因為當男人與女人逐漸成長、成熟，我們開始看見人生並非只是價值和資源的角力、並非只是演化心理和避孕措施所催生的無意識產物，人生遠比這些還多太多了。所以終究我們必須面對男性與女性的整合問題，我們終究得學會承諾、承擔、溝通、諒解、接納。當然，還有愛。**\n\n男人不會一輩子都在精蟲衝腦的求愛階段，女人也不會一輩子都在盼著更強更高價值的男人來接收他，**男人和女人之間有遠比紅藥丸所談的還要多太多的話題，有責任、分工、照顧、家庭、子女、衰老、以及死亡。**\n\n我百分之百支持我們應該要看穿那些好萊塢、迪士尼製造出的愛情夢幻泡泡，但同時我們應該用力看見那些每天心懷期待地回家迎接老婆小孩的男人、看見那些每天不厭其煩地照顧家庭的女人、看見那些每天手牽手在公園散步有說有笑的老夫婦。\n\n那樣理想的人生風景，需要遠比紅藥丸所教的還要更多更多的努力和智慧才足以達到，但我相信那樣的人生風景，對於大多數人都是遠比年輕時同時交過多少女朋友還要更有意義、且更值得擁有的。\n\n---  \n**更完整的觀點**\n\n女人的天性，或更精確一點——**慕強擇偶**，並不是你的敵人。慕強擇偶作為演化過程中的「人擇」重要手段，它是形塑著人類男性與女性的重要力量，換句話說，**如果沒有慕強擇偶，男人就不會是所謂的男人、女人也不會是所謂的女人。**\n\n仔細想想，如果慕強擇偶不是女人的一種天性，那麼男人會少了一堆相互較勁、進而讓自己能夠出頭的活動。如果沒有這種天性，當你做了什麼有成就感的事情時，你的女人也就不會對你投以傾慕的眼光。如果沒有這種天性，男人就不會真的有更大的動力去深入危險、克服困難、進而超越自己，成為比昨天的自己還要更強的人。\n\n沒有慕強擇偶，你所愛的女人就不會是你愛的那個樣子，你也就不會有什麼更多的動力去真正成為一個男人。缺乏了女性的傾慕，一個男人可能頂多只會為了在工作上更有成就而多付出一些力氣精進自己，但剩下的，難道我們還會有什麼動力去做更多嗎？\n\n即便如此，將男人的「自我超越」都視為是為女人而做的，仍是個錯誤的觀點。\n\n紅藥丸點出了男性的「可棄性」、告訴我們為什麼因為缺少懷胎的能力，所以我們的價值幾乎總是可被拋棄的——這點，在人類作為一種動物的歷史中，是正確的。但相對地，正因為男性的可棄性，我們才會有更多的理由去花力氣找到自己在這個世界上的位置，我們才有更多的動機去證明自身的價值。（我當然不是說女性在世界上的位置和價值只有懷孕生子，但生理上而言，女性確實獨占了「生育」這個重要天職的潛能。）\n\n**我們應該將慕強擇偶，看作是大自然——作為一個母性的力量、亦即女性的總體化身——對男人的鼓舞與挑戰。正因為我們的可棄性、正因為女性的慕強擇偶，大自然賦予我們更多的動機去自我超越、去克服苦難、去撰寫自己生命的英雄篇章。**\n\n沒有慕強擇偶和男性的可棄性，就不會有隨處可見的「英雄」縮影，我們既不會在歷史上看到眾多偉大的男性為了更大的目標奮鬥一生，也不會在自己身上看見那個需要成為「英雄」的動機。沒有這些大自然的條件設定，人類根本不會有今天的文明。\n\n大自然母親透過這些設定，不斷地試煉著男人的心智與體魄，她透過每一個女人、以及我們自己在群體間的競爭，試圖鍛鍊我們、要我們進化成更純粹更卓越的自己。與其對於你沒辦法怠惰一生的事實感到氣餒，你該慶幸大自然給了你這樣的考驗，而考驗的後頭是那個成功轉化、脫胎換骨、粹鍊出更堅毅的品格的自己。\n\n慕強擇偶並非你的敵人，也不是要你竭盡力氣去擊倒其他男人的價值，慕強擇偶是大自然要鍛鍊你成為你所能成為的自己，要你真正地長大，成為一個堅定、能克服磨難、站穩腳步的男人。女人在這個過程中，既是裁判、也是見證人。\n\n**這才是為什麼你該找一個願意與你爭執、指出你的不是、且誠心期許你變得更好的伴侶，因為當你找到一個能夠看清楚你的潛能、且真心地想要你將潛能完全地發揮、並在你安逸怠惰時給你當頭棒喝的人，你會知道那是上天給你的恩賜、要你徹底地燃燒生命以成為上天期許你成為的人。**\n\n---\n所以在男性的可棄性和慕強擇偶面前，你該做些什麼才能成長為你該成為的自己？我相信答案並不是「自我提升」、並非只是提高你在他人眼中的價值，因為**你再怎麼「自我提升」也無法真正改變自己只不過是在兩性市場裡的另一個選擇的事實。**\n\n我相信更好的答案，是**勇於承擔生命中的責任**。\n\n對，這就是紅藥丸要你不要相信的東西、那些傳統價值中要求男人該做的「負責任」行為。但我會反問，我們憑什麼用最近二三十年的當代見識去否定跟慕強擇偶幾乎一樣歷史悠久的男性人生建議？我們憑什麼懷疑人類歷史幾千年來、跨越了各式各樣的文化都對男人抱持這個自我超越、犧牲、承擔責任的期待，就因為現代人比較想要相信「多健身多看書多把妹」之類的建議比較好？\n\n就像我說的，你再怎麼健身看書、把到再多的妹，你也始終只是另一個兩性市場上的選擇，永遠會有比你更高價值的男人、也永遠會有看不見你的價值的女人。\n\n當我提出「承擔責任」的建議，我並不是要你回去乖乖奉行長輩們期待你做的事，而是要你**清楚地思考你在每一個當下能夠為自己和他人所承擔最大的責任是什麼，並且將之一肩扛起。**\n\n**當你在工作上、家庭上、個人生活上都自願承擔起更大的責任，這意味著你必須從你自己開始、將你的人生打理好、為自己的生命負起全責。** 你會一如往常地健身看書洗冷水澡跟冥想，但原因不再是因為你要「提升自己的價值」、而是因為承擔生命的責任的第一步，就是將你自己準備好，以迎接更大的人生挑戰。\n\n在你為自己的生命負起全責之後，你才能夠更清晰地思考你真正可以為他人所做的事情，而不是在你的身心還亂成一團時就順著他人的意去扛起那些你根本扛不起的重擔。於是你可以開始思考如何在工作上有所精進或有更多產出、如何對家人有更多的關懷或修復那些你深知該去修復的關係、如何找到那個好或壞都能跟你契合且不斷砥礪你的另一半、如何把未來可能的婚姻甚至育兒生活都計畫好、如何在經濟上能有所規劃以面對未來的任何不確定性。\n\n**與其問「我該如何『找到』理想的另一半」，你該問的是「我該如何『成為』理想的另一半」。**\n\n主動去承擔你當下所能夠承擔的最大責任，你會一點一滴地將自己原生的「可棄性」拋之在後，你會逐漸成為一個所謂「有肩膀」的男人，因為你不僅能夠將自己生命的重擔扛下來，肩膀上更能夠扛著其他你所愛的人的幸福。\n\n主動承擔這些責任，你會看見一個截然不同的「自我提升」的動機，或者說得更精確一點，是你會不斷地「自我超越」、把你關心並能夠影響的範圍從自己擴展到其他人身上。**你必須變得更強壯、更堅定、擁有更清楚的思緒、將人生思考得更徹底，你才有能力去承擔更大的責任、讓自己成為一個更重要的價值主體。**\n\n**在這個過程中，你會看見比自己更大的意義、並不斷地重新認識這個更堅毅更有承擔的自己。** 這是大自然母親對你的考驗、這是上天期許你去完成的天命、這更是人類文明數千年來早已千錘百煉的道路——這才是慕強擇偶的真正意義，這才是克服自身可棄性的真正解答。\n\n希望我成功地對傳統價值中的「責任」做了一個當代的詮釋，並讓你看清楚這份責任感背後真正的意義，以及你在承擔這個責任的過程中必須耗費多少努力、去瞭解和超越自己。\n\n**責任的承擔不該是盲目的，但它確實是超越理性的。你必須看見這一切背後的原因、信任這趟旅程將充滿意義，然後拿出勇氣將生命的重擔一肩扛起。**","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.356043107Z","tags":null},"/Research//%E9%81%93%E5%BE%B7%E6%98%AF%E7%BE%A4%E9%AB%94%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%A8%E6%9C%9F%E7%A6%8F%E7%A5%89%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C":{"title":"","content":"tags:

#📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[道德]]、[[社會]]、[[信任]]、[[秩序]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\n\n---\n# 道德的「利社會」本質\n\n多數人大概都認為道德是人類獨有的、源自某種崇高理性的產物，但其實許多研究指出各種哺乳動物身上都可以觀察到明顯的「利社會 (Prosocial)」行為，某種層面上這幾乎可以被視為道德最原始的型態。\n\n曾有不會游泳的黑猩猩為了拯救他人而在動物園的護城河中溺水；有恆河猴發現拉動鏈子可以獲得食物、但同時會對同伴造成電擊，於是寧願挨餓好幾天；如果兩隻黑猩猩打完一架，其他黑猩猩會安慰打輸的那隻猩猩；又假如牠們打到不可開交，母猩猩們會把雙方兜在一起試圖要牠們和好、或直接從牠們手中搶走石頭來阻止打鬥——牠們彷彿知道這種不融洽的氛圍只會對社群有害無益、使社群更容易遭受外來侵襲。[1]\n\n立基於這些證據，靈長類專家及動物行為學家法蘭斯·德瓦爾 (Frans de Waal) 博士是以主張：許多動物為了社群的更大利益所採取的「利社會」行為——包含了同理心、學習並遵守社會規則、互惠、以和為貴等特性——其實就是人類道德的前身。當然，人類還發明了獎勵、懲罰、名譽、宗教等更高層次的機制，並加上一定程度的判斷推理，確保道德準則能被確實執行。\n\n德瓦爾博士的主張遭遇演化生物學、心理學、乃至倫理學的多方挑戰：演化生物學家George Williams認為道德只不過是演化的意外副產品；心理學家反對將任何情緒狀態歸因於動物；哲學家們則一路追隨康德的觀點，相信理性才真正主掌了人類的道德判斷，因而著迷於完整精煉的倫理學體系。\n\n不過，秉持經驗主義的18世紀哲學家休謨倒是跟德瓦爾博士站在同一陣線，他們都相信道德判斷是從情感出發，理性只在我們做出道德決定後才開始作用。原始人類生活在惡劣環境中，經常得快速做出攸關生死的決定，不可能有時間進行道德評估；人類行為勢必優先來自快速、自動化、情緒化的判斷，推理往往是事後才出現。無獨有偶，當代知名的社會心理學家Jonathan Haidt在其[多本著作](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010669638)中也一再指出這點：「（人們在道德上）直覺先來，策略推理後到。」\n\n德瓦爾博士認為，既然我們能在黑猩猩身上明確觀察到同理心等「良善」的情感，那麼鑒於人類和靈長類動物間的演化連續性，我們似乎得承認道德根源與動物的天生情感間也確實存在著強烈連結。他相信情感之所以成為我們的道德指引，正因為它們是演化形塑的成果。雖然缺乏了演化和生物學的知識，但孟子的「四善端」亦將人的道德潛能根植於人的溫情厚意中，顯示出儒家觀察人性之精微。\n\n德瓦爾博士最後將道德定義為「社群基於共同價值而建立的衝突控管系統，其產生的一種辨別對錯的直覺」。或講白話點，引述他在《Primates and Philosophers》中寫道的：「人類道德的本質，就是天擇賦予我們的這種關切群體福祉的生命判準。」\n\n---\n# 運動家精神\n\n不只是靈長類，其他動物也經常展現「利社會」的行為：像是郊狼這類社會性肉食動物在玩耍時，牠們會秉持一套公平而不踰矩的交戰規則，內容大概像是「如果我找你玩，我就是真的要跟你玩，而不是打算支配你、跟你交配、或把你吃掉」。充滿精力和攻擊性的郊狼幼崽還懂得要適時退讓、讓對方略佔上風，以保持與同伴的遊戲情緒；如果牠們不這麼做就會被忽視和排斥。[2]\n\n類似的現象連在實驗室老鼠身上都可以發現：當一大一小的兩隻老鼠重複被配對在一起，小老鼠會去找大老鼠玩摔角。理論上，大老鼠每一次都可以靠身材優勢輕鬆取勝，但假如他沒有讓小老鼠至少有三成以上的機會能贏過他，小老鼠就不會再去找他玩。[3]\n\n在這些案例裡，小動物們都下意識地知道該保持興致、讓遊戲繼續進行，不應逞一時之快、欺凌弱小或處於劣勢的對手。這暗示著這些動物承襲了某種意義上的「運動家精神」，它的內容大概像是「充分信任自己和他人都以同一套遊戲規則和公正精神進行比賽」。更傳神的比喻，又或許是小時候長輩告訴我們的「重要的不是你有沒有贏，而是你如何參與這場比賽」。\n\n運動家精神之所以重要，是因為對於任何社會性的動物來說，生命不外就是由一連串的賽局／遊戲 (Play)所組成——比起贏得眼前這場比賽，更重要的是你會不會有機會持續被邀請參加未來的比賽。你不會想當那隻逞一時之快而霸凌弱者的狼，因為這只意味著你會失去他人的信任、失去社群的保障、失去未來建立更多連結的機會。這即是所謂「公平競爭 (Play fair)」的意義。\n\n人類作為社會性的動物，如何能讓自己「繼續比賽」亦是我們與生俱來的生存策略，驅使我們盡可能採取「利社會」的言行。換句話說，我們總是有好理由為了人生的長遠發展、為了保障自己在社群中的位置、為了強化自己所處社群的信任感，去做一個正直誠篤的人。這也是為什麼即便一個人的名聲未必會對他造成實質影響，大部分人仍非常在乎他人對自己的評價——在物競天擇的原始世界裡，一個人是否能夠博得他人信任、適時信任他人、持續參與集體行動並受到群體保護，意味著最根本的生存或滅亡。\n\n所以，立基於無數先人對各種遊戲規則的協議、並且恭謹秉持的運動家精神之上，人類方能超越原始部落人數上限、進行更大幅度的合作分工。誠如《[人類大歷史](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010774982)》指出的：對神祇的信仰，使人們共享同一套心靈寄託和道德指引；對國家的想像，使人類社群得以幾無上限地擴大和團結；對金錢的共識，使世上資源和人類技能可以被有效分配和計量；對理性的堅持，使科學、科技、及更好的生活成為可能。\n\n對這些社會機制的信任，是你我身處的現代文明底下不可忽視的支柱。\n\n\n---\n\n註\n\n1.

They'll be challenged from the other side by saying \"how about couples who don't want to have children / are infertile / are gay even?\"\n\nMatt Walsh uses the phrase \"by nature\" to describe the fundamental meaning/purpose for marriage, being for procreation \"by its own nature\". Much like we have a biological definition for what is a \"woman\" which is based on nature, but it does not mean any infertile woman is then not a woman anymore. \n\nThe key distinction here, is that the conservatives cares a lot about the **moral aim set for a social union / institution**, while the liberals cares a bout the **criteria for forming a social union / institution**. If the criteria for forming a social union does not **calls for** a certain responsibility, then that responsibility will likely not be adopted and will be forgotten, then the initial meaning for that social union will be gone / changed. \n\nIronically, the conservatives is aiming at something higher and in the future (what we're going to do once we get marriage), but the liberals are looking at what leads us here and where we are right now (what kind of couple we are and why can't I get married as long as we're in love). \n\nSo the conservatives want marriage to **call for** a certain responsibility, as they believe the adoption of responsibility is the foundation of a stable society, so if you voluntarily go into a marriage, it should mean you're willing to adopt the responsibility of procreation voluntarily. \n\nThe liberals are much more tolerant with reinforcing this moral aim in things they ask people to do (they still have their own moral aim in things they care about, obviously), which is why they're willing to change the definition / initial design / criteria of marriage to allow more people in. But once we've done that, we no longer call for the responsibility that were once implicit in the social union, and it's likely this responsibility will be forgotten (as it obviously has) and the society will need to find another way to restore this moral aim in order to have enough man power to sustain. \n\nSide note, what the conservatives get wrong is that we do NOT always want to call everyone on a same type of responsibility, because that is only good for sustaining a certain type of society without making any progress. We do very often need people to NOT respond to a certain call of responsibility and respond to another one that they're called upon, so there're a healthy variety of human beings where innovation and progress can safely happen. So in this sense, it's important to burn down some old institutions so the new ones can be formed and progress can be made. And what the conservatives are more afraid of is probably not the changes of the meaning of our institutions, but rather the loss of voluntary (or involuntary at times) adoption of responsibilities - they essentially are fighting nihilism and hedonism, and for very good reason.\n\nThe conservatives (nor the liberals) also don't necessarily have a good grasp of whether the liberals are \"cleaning out a path for social progress and making old non-useful things obsolete\" or are simply \"burning down the foundation of a society and everything we cherish\". This is always a constant tension with a society which is completely another topic.\n\nThe call for responsibility (for procreation) is what gives meaning to many people's life, if we're willing to adopt it voluntarily, it's also for the society to sustain itself. If we alter the criteria and lessen the call for responsibility for procreation, we'll be soon in trouble with a unsustainable model that only leads to hedonism and societal collapse.\n\nOne may, however, argue that from a higher standpoint, the societal collapse is a more efficient and 'fair' way to restore the balance on Earth (i.e. reduce human beings) without our intentional interference with the society which might cause more harm than good. \n\nI'd say this is somewhat correct, but an extremely cruel, cynical, and \"conservative\" view of human species, as it assumes we can do nothing to prevent our societal collapse and nature simply need to swipe us out (i.e. killing lots of people) to restore its balance. I believe as time goes on, we can do better and have been doing better, and will need to find a shared global ethic that'll at the same time call for voluntarily adoption of responsibilities from the individuals but also allowing them to have the maximum freedom. I believe this will have something to do with the societal design in which we've already tipped our toes, alongside the technological progress.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//AI/AI-Means-a-Brilliant-Doc...":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: \nhttps://twitter.com/balajis/status/1623861319031218176\n\n---\n\n- AI means a brilliant doctor on your phone.

Lightness is often sought after because it can result in greater efficiency, improved performance, and reduced resource consumption, while still maintaining or improving the quality and durability of the product.\n\nFor example, in the automotive industry, \"adding lightness\" has been a guiding principle for many high-performance sports cars, with automakers using lightweight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase speed and handling. In the aerospace industry, reducing the weight of aircraft and spacecraft is critical for efficiency and safety.\n\nIn design, lightness can also refer to the appearance or perception of lightness, even if the actual weight or mass of the object has not been reduced. For example, a product with a minimalist or streamlined design might appear \"light\" and unobtrusive, even if it is physically heavy.\n\n# what does 'adding lightness' to the society could potentially mean\n\nThe concept of \"adding lightness\" is typically associated with the design and engineering of physical products, but it can also be applied to society as a whole. In a broader sense, \"adding lightness\" could mean reducing the burden or weight that people carry in their daily lives, whether that be physical, mental, or emotional.\n\nFor example, in the realm of social policy, \"adding lightness\" could mean reducing bureaucracy and simplifying processes to make it easier for people to access government services or benefits. It could also mean improving access to healthcare, education, or other essential services, reducing economic inequality, or promoting environmental sustainability. In these contexts, \"adding lightness\" could improve the well-being and quality of life of individuals, making it easier for them to pursue their goals and aspirations.\n\nUltimately, \"adding lightness\" to society means creating a more efficient, equitable, and sustainable world that enables individuals to live their lives to the fullest, unencumbered by unnecessary burdens or barriers.\n\n# how could bitcoin 'add lightness' to the world\n\nBitcoin has the potential to \"add lightness\" to the world in several ways:\n\n1.  Financial Inclusion: Bitcoin provides an alternative to traditional financial systems and could help to include people who have limited access to banking services or who live in countries with unstable economies. With Bitcoin, anyone with an internet connection can participate in the global economy, making it a powerful tool for financial inclusion.\n    \n2.  Reduced Transaction Costs: Bitcoin transactions are typically faster and cheaper than traditional banking transactions, especially for international transfers. This could be particularly beneficial for small businesses and entrepreneurs who need to send and receive payments quickly and cost-effectively.\n    \n3.  Increased Security and Privacy: Bitcoin's blockchain technology provides a high level of security and privacy for users, protecting against fraud, theft, and identity theft. This could be especially important for people who live in countries with weak legal systems or where corruption is prevalent.\n    \n4.  Decentralization: Bitcoin is a decentralized system, meaning that it is not controlled by any central authority or institution. This provides a level of transparency and trust that is lacking in traditional financial systems, and could help to reduce corruption and increase accountability.\n    \n\nOverall, Bitcoin has the potential to \"add lightness\" to the world by providing an alternative financial system that is faster, cheaper, more secure, and more inclusive than traditional banking systems. It could help to reduce barriers to entry, increase transparency, and promote economic growth and development.\n\n# how can web 3.0 help the world acquire global ethic?\n\nWeb 3.0, which is sometimes referred to as the \"Semantic Web,\" has the potential to help the world acquire a global ethic in several ways:\n\n1.  Decentralization: Web 3.0 is based on decentralized technology, which means that it is not controlled by any central authority or institution. This provides a level of transparency and trust that is lacking in centralized systems, and could help to reduce corruption and increase accountability.\n    \n2.  Interoperability: Web 3.0 aims to create a more interconnected and interoperable web, where data can be shared and exchanged more easily between different applications and systems. This could help to promote collaboration and cooperation between people and organizations around the world, making it easier to share ideas and work towards common goals.\n    \n3.  Privacy and Security: Web 3.0 is designed with privacy and security in mind, which could help to protect users from data breaches and cyber attacks. This could be particularly important in the context of global ethics, as it could help to protect sensitive information and prevent it from being misused or exploited.\n    \n4.  Community-driven: Web 3.0 is driven by a community of developers and users, who work together to build and improve the technology. This creates a more collaborative and democratic approach to technology development, which could help to promote a sense of shared responsibility and ownership among users.\n    \n\nOverall, Web 3.0 has the potential to help the world acquire a global ethic by promoting transparency, collaboration, and accountability, while also protecting privacy and security. It could help to create a more connected and collaborative world, where people work together towards common goals and values. However, it is important to note that the success of Web 3.0 in promoting a global ethic will depend on the values and ethics of the people who develop and use the technology, and on the policies and regulations that are put in place to govern its use.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//Analyzing-Dads-Fundamental-Viewpoints":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌱 \nlinks: [[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[Meditations on Moloch]]\n[[Alex Epstein - The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels]]\n[[Bishop Robert Barron Christianity and the Catholic Church]]\n\n---\n- Worship of a subjective, undefined, conflicting ideal of 'nature'\n\t- **He thinks we should 'take care of' our body by adopting an optimized 'natural' lifestyle (but failed to mention what that 'natural' lifestyle really looks like, and why it's not like stone age human species), but also should seek medical assistance (when he agrees it's better) and avoid medical assistance (when he disagree because it's 'unnatural') both at the same time.**\n\t- On one hand, we should do the correct things (which we only know largely because of the cumulation of knowledge and science) to prolong our life and health, but on the other hand, he agrees there're too many humans so some probably will have to die. \n\t- Sheltered by the completely safe, abundant, convenient urban life free from diseaces and hunger, he failed to see that what humans do to prolong our life is largely through technologies  and (the cumulation of) knowledges that are completely NOT natural (unless one attemps to argue against that point), because **nature is actually absolutely brutal and hostile to our lives.**\n\t- The '**perfectly natural state of things**', where people just live in harmony with nature, and **already and always** know how to treat themselves (their bodies) and each other without doing anything 'unnatural' and stupid, but still die (for some legit yet unknown reason) in the most 'natural' manner possible, is a completely delusional dream only existing in his undefined, subjective belief of the good of 'nature'.\n\t- On the other hand, he also believes that there're too many humans on this earth (as we're sort of a cancer to the planet) and animals in the zoo are being treated cruelly.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq55b1bdxcnzetwsd7bs76w9))\n- BFT is so-named because it represents a solution to the \"Byzantine generals' problem,\" a logical dilemma that researchers Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostak and Marshall Pease described in an [academic paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Flamport%2Fpubs%2Fbyz.pdf) published in 1982. Essentially, it imagines a group of Byzantine generals and their armies surrounding a castle and preparing to attack. To be successful, these armies must all attack at the same time. But they know that there is a traitor in their midst. The problem they face is one of launching a successful attack with one, unknown bad actor in their system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq55bxjpwt35ey18x5fq3eeb))\n- In any distributed computing environment, meaning an environment where multiple users, applications, servers or other types of nodes compose the environment (like a blockchain), there is a risk that rogue or unreliable actors could cause the environment to break apart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq56wjpxpmar4qrygjadb34j))\n- In order to be reliable, a distributed computing environment has to be designed in a way that solves the Byzantine generals' problem by providing what's known as BFT. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq56x71qh0435824tey4tm5h))\n- Perhaps nowhere is BFT more essential than on a blockchain. Most traditional distributed computing environments have central configuration databases or authorities that can help right wrongs in the event that Byzantine failures occur. But on a blockchain there is, by definition, no central authority. Blockchains' ability to legitimate transactions based on community consensus alone is what makes them so powerful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5706mf0rtgf1q00dr24ra2))\n- This heavy reliance on community consensus also makes Byzantine faults a particularly important challenge for blockchain. If some members of the community send inconsistent information to others about transactions, the reliability of the blockchain breaks down, and there is no authority that can step in to correct it. So, unless you can place absolute trust in everyone who participates in your blockchain (which you can't in most situations), you need a way to protect against the Byzantine faults that could occur in the event that some members distribute inaccurate, misleading or malicious transaction information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq572x0c541m31n7p4vh9kcg))\n- Many of the most influential blockchain systems to emerge so far, including Bitcoin, have relied on a concept called [proof of work](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-proof-of-work-concept/) (PoW). Under this model, anyone who wants to add to the blockchain must perform a work-intensive task using information from the existing blockchain in order to add new information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57a6zshvdxnm3g6bebs8mz))\n- On a blockchain that is sufficiently large, the PoW requirement effectively provides BFT. This approach also has a limitation, however. It requires the expenditure of a large amount of computational effort for no purpose other than fault tolerance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57bt6z92jszqsp8vr0j0x8))\n- An alternative solution - and one that does not require compute-intensive operations - centers on relying on node votes and majority consensus in order to root out faults. The downside to this strategy is that it provides protection against byzantine faults only so long as a relatively large majority of nodes on the blockchain continue to act legitimately. Consensus regarding legitimate transactions could become unclear in the event that the number of rogue nodes began approaching fifty percent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57mhp51yfgjk8t6a28sv8c))\n- since blockchain technology in many places is still in the design and planning phases, understanding BFT matters for people who want to apply blockchains as novel solutions in areas beyond digital currency. Bitcoin's approach to the byzantine fault issue may not be practical for other types of blockchain applications. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57jy2etygen4186mrmn339))\n- BFT is a crucial part of an effective blockchain and there are multiple ways in which it can be implemented.

The people running these institutions typically have career tenure; they were not democratically elected and are [not easily fired](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/employee-relations/reference-materials/douglas-factors.pdf). They are thus not obviously accountable to the public they claim to serve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe3b70t3a0m80maht860fec))\n- Crypto protocols, by contrast, allow millions of active participants—both customers and producers—in a market to develop decentralized regulatory [mechanisms](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/decentralized-finance/) that avoid both the perils of [captured](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/nobel-economist-george-stigler-on-capture-theory-and-the-inevitability-of-businesses-seeking-regulation-and-tariffs/) state regulators and corporate self-regulators. It is only a matter of time before cloud-based entities emerge for decentralized regulation of industries beyond cryptocurrencies.

International rule of law is becoming rule of code ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4kcfc0a1awjbwwmspxpbv))\n- small countries would prefer some kind of order rather than being at the mercy of one power (the United States) that gives international rule of law only lip service and another power (China) that doesn’t even do that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4qvre301v2gc3c66mvg0m))\n- For this, at least in the commercial realm, we believe they will increasingly turn to what we call “rule of code.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4r5z8q4zgk4wwaj5z1fca))\n- Property rights themselves can be digitized through geographic information system (GIS) mapping and land cadastration (surveying and parceling of property), eroding the bureaucratic opacity that favors predatory governments. And rather than subject themselves to expropriation risks, investors could demand governments put up collateral codified in smart contracts that would be forfeited in default. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4tk73c9t6x4stnfvqhzf6))\n- We are still in the early days, but enforceable international law may become synonymous with decentralized smart contracts, at least in the context of international trade. And beyond trade, crypto protocols provide [transnational protection](https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/is-bitcoin-anarchy-or-civilization) for civil liberties like freedom of speech and privacy. This is not yet the entirety of what the rules-based order purports to protect, but the ability to guarantee free speech and free markets to anyone with an internet connection is a major step forward.

Web3 is addressing global inequality by sharing the reward—and the risk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4wxqq2cdy2mcvfyzgm56a))\n- From a political standpoint, anti-technology activists have only been able to muster [slim and contentious](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-battle-continues-prop-22-struck-5046989/) margins of support for new regulations because [app workers](https://rein.pk/replacing-middle-management-with-apis) did not profit as much from the rise of the sharing economy as app developers—giving a wedge for class actions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe38788t72fcmbqv5dxbn6r))\n- However, the next step is the full Web3-based decentralization of online marketplaces and sharing economy services, which is already well underway via peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies (so-called [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)). These new forms of transnational regulation, where app users have a stake—and a say—in how their platforms are run, will expand beyond cryptocurrencies to the peer-to-peer exchange of other goods and services over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe38nmhwq4qf5ahnwnfywk3))\n- The most promising way to resolve this may be via Web3 protocols, which can be thought of as a variant of universal basic income that splits the reward—and the risk—of building a giant tech service across millions of volunteer asset holders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe547p8qz7z8nfpxxc5mah0))\n- with the rise of [decentralized finance](https://defipulse.com/), there is now an incredible variety of financing mechanisms to allow smart people with no money to find smart people with money to build tools that allow all people to make money. And that is how Web3 may accomplish what no antitrust action or arbitrary seizure could. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe55gxgztd7xb5kbv0rn4g4))\n- 9. Companies, cities, currencies, communities, and countries are all becoming networks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe55jg1jj671ekfkx8759vb))\n- We should start thinking of collections of people—whether communities, cities, companies, or countries—as cohesive agents unto themselves, less constrained by territoriality and with different layers aligned with one another in shifting combinations. Physical governments can, for example, integrate with digital networks, and companies can run as apps on a city state’s dedicated blockchain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe580k10qscfwzsr8fb76bd))\n- 10. Power is decentralizing away from the United States and China ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5dswzfbb0a8d7pdt7v47w))\n- About [75 percent](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) of the world’s population, more than [60 percent](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/gdp_share/) of global GDP, and around [50 percent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-26/the-geography-of-the-world-s-billionaires?sref=wAVxlDts) of all billionaires are neither Chinese nor American. Those two superpowers may well fight, but it’s not obvious if the rest of the world will want to align with either party. Indeed, with the rise of decentralized protocols, we anticipate that many states in the middle may decide to use Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains for China- and U.S.-resistant communication and financial transaction channels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5fmzcnvs9ryqq5919w3hj))\n- That is, in addition to building national stacks (data and app ecosystems) for domestic transactions and communications, countries may use neutral protocols for international transactions and communications. This gives every country a choice: Rather than being forced to take sides in a new Cold War, they can update the “Non-Aligned Movement” to form an “[Aligned Movement](https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/#the-decentralized-movement),” where they rally around their joint sovereign stakes in Web3 protocols to facilitate cross-border trade. Early signs of this are already visible with [Latin American](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1402279912623464458) countries adopting Bitcoin. Not incidentally, such protocols will also command the respect (and investment) of many millions of Chinese and American citizens. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5h0znsedr6m7pngynpqst))\n- the future will be a decentralized race to the top as countries, cities, companies, and communities—physical and virtual—compete to attract talent and capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5hnw4w251em9t1rsbhaat))\n- We do not argue that states are irrelevant; rather, they will be more relevant if they embrace the arrow of history and work with the network and less relevant if they attempt rearguard actions against it. Such is the nature of great protocol politics.

It is easy and comfortable to be taken care of, to put your trust in authority. Liberty is risky. It takes work. It also takes humility. There is a hubris inherent in knowing you are right and aiming for a system that makes it as easy as possible for you to get your way.

says it's not a problem to print more money because the velocity of the money is very low the monetary velocity is low 09:30that's another scalar okay so the truth of the matter is inflation is not a scalar inflation is an in-dimensional vector money velocity is not a scalar um develo saying what's the velocity of money oh oh it's slow or it's fast it ignores the question of what medium is the money moving through in the same way that you know 10:00what's the speed of sound okay well what is sound right sound you know sound is uh is a compression wave it's energy uh moving through a medium but the speed is different so for example the speed of sound through air is different than the speed of sound through water and and a sound moves faster through water it moves faster through a solid and it moves faster to a stiffer solid so there isn't one ([Time 0:09:17](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cd7a814d8ed0008cfca1a))\n- \u003e the fundamental problem is if you see the world as a scalar you simply pick the one number which is which supports whatever you want to do and you ignore the universe of other consequences from your behavior ([Time 0:10:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cd7bc70c6f20008cbe8fc))\n- \u003e i'm really shocked today that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics has been captured by scalar arithmetic 13:00for example if if you read you know read any article in new york times or the wall street journal right they just refer to there's an inflation number or the the cpi or the inflation rate is x and if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation generally they're all based upon the idea that inflation equals cpi and then they try to extrapolate from that and you just get nowhere with it ([Time 0:12:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cd80f70c6f20008cbe8fd))\n- \u003e you can pretty much 17:00create any inflation rate you want by constructing a market basket a weighted basket of products or services or assets that yield you the answer ([Time 0:16:58](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdac5b54d430008474643))\n- \u003e my criticism of economist is rather than embracing inflation based upon its fundamental idea which is the rate at which the price of things go 19:30up right they've been captured by a mainstream conventional thinking to immediately equate inflation to the government issued cpi or government-issued pce or government-issued ppi measure which was never the rate at which things go up it's simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and services the government wishes to track go up 20:00now the problem with that is is two big things one thing is the government gets to create the market basket and so they keep changing what's in the basket over time so i mean if if i keep tr if i said three years ago you should go see ten concerts a year and the concert tickets now cost two hundred dollars each now it's two thousand dollars a year to go see concerts now i'm in charge of calculating inflation so i redefine you know your entertainment quota for the year to be 20:30eight netflix streaming concerts and now they don't cost two thousand dollars they cost nothing and there is no inflation but you don't get your concerts right so the problem starts with continually changing the definition of the market basket but in my opinion that's not the biggest problem the more the more egregious problem is the the fundamental idea that assets aren't products or services 21:00assets can't be inflated with an asset a house a share of apple stock um a bond um any a bitcoin is an asset um or uh a picasso painting so not a consumable good not a uh not not an apple that you can eat right if i throw away an asset then uh i'm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it so 21:30what happens if i change the policy such that let's take the class example a million dollar bond at a five percent interest rate gives you fifty thousand dollars a year in risk-free income you might retire on fifty thousand dollars a year in a low-cost jurisdiction so the cost of social security or early retirement is one million dollars when the interest rate is five percent uh during the the crisis of march of 2020 the interest rate went on a 10-year bond went to 50 basis points 22:00okay so now the cost of that bond is 10 million dollars okay the cost of social security went from a million dollars to 10 million dollars so if you wanted to work your entire life save money and then retire risk-free and live happily ever after on a 50 000 salary living on a beach in mexico wherever you wanted to go you had hyperinflation the cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10 over the course of you know some amount of time in fact 22:30in that case that was like over the course of about 12 years right as the inflation rate ground down the asset traded up but the you know the conventional view is oh that's not a problem because it's good that that assets it's good that the bond is highly priced because we own the bond or um what's the problem with the inflation rate in housing being 19 it's an awful problem for a 22 year old that's starting their first job that's 23:00saving money to buy a house but it would be characterized as a benefit to society by a conventional economist who would say well housing asset values are higher because of interest rate fluctuation and now the economy's got more wealth and uh and so that's that's viewed as a benefit ([Time 0:19:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdb5e2d7ee800082ed9b6))\n- \u003e a conventional view of inflation as cpi understates the human misery that's in inflicted upon the working class and and on uh mainstream companies uh by uh by the political class and so it's a massive shift of wealth from the working 24:00class to the property class it's a massive shift of power from the free market uh to the centrally governed or the controlled market it's a massive shift of power from the people to the government ([Time 0:23:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdb832d7ee800082ed9b7))\n- \u003e on average it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply is about seven percent a year all the 26:00way up to the year 2020 if you look at the s p index which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks it returned about 10 percent if you talk to 10 a year for 100 years the money supply is expanding at 7 100 years if you actually talk to economists or you look at the the economy and you ask the question how fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year generally about two to three percent 26:30like the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a two and a half three percent improvement a year as measured by gdp is that are you okay with that not sure i'm not sure i'd go that far yet but i would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff yeah and if you ask the question how much more efficiently will we do the stuff next year than this year or how what's the value of all of our 27:00innovations and inventions and investments in the past 12 months you'd be hard-pressed to say we get two percent better typical investor thinks they they're 10 better every year so if you look at what's going on really when you're holding a million dollars of stocks and you're getting a 10 gain a year you really get a seven percent expansion of the money supply you're getting a two or three percent gain under best circumstances and 27:30another way to say that is if the money supply stopped expanding at seven percent a year the s p yield might be three percent and not ten percent it probably should be now that that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental questions like if i borrow a billion dollars and pay three percent interest and the money supply expands at seven to ten percent a year and i ended up making a ten percent return on a you know billion dollar investment 28:00paying three percent interest is that fair and who who suffered so that i could do that because in an environment where you're just inflating the money supply and you're holding the assets constant it stands the reason that the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply and the difference in asset appreciations is going to be a function of the scarce desirable quality of the assets and to what extent can i make 28:30more of them and to what extent are they are they truly limited in supply ([Time 0:25:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdbe42d7ee800082ed9b8))\n- \u003e money is monetary energy or economic energy 29:30and the economic energy has to find its way into a medium so if you want to move it rapidly as a medium of exchange has to find its way into currency but the money can also flow into property like a house or gold if the money flows into property it'll probably hold its value much better if the money flows into currency right if you had put a hundred thousand dollars in this house you would have 305 x return over 92 years but if you had put the money a 30:00hundred thousand dollars in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement you would have lost 99.7 percent of your wealth over the same time period so um so the the expansion of the currency creates uh creates a massive inefficiency in the society what i'll call an adiabatic lapse it's what we're doing is we're bleeding the civilization to death ([Time 0:29:24](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdc102d7ee800082ed9b9))\n- \u003e when you're inflating let's say you're inflating the money so the currency supply by six percent you're sucking six percent of the energy out of the fluid that the economy is 32:30using to function ([Time 0:32:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdc4514d8ed0008cfca1b))\n- \u003e policymakers are well-intentioned but generally all all government policy is inflationary and all government it's 34:00inflammatory and inflationary so what i mean by that is you know when you have a policy uh pursuing uh supply chain independence if you have an energy policy if you have a labor policy if you have a trade policy if you have a you know any any kind of foreign policy a domestic policy a manufacturing policy every one of these medical policy every one of these policies interferes with the free market and and 34:30generally prevents some rational actor from doing it in a cheaper more efficient way ([Time 0:33:54](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdcb0a7a2a20008a1292f))\n- \u003e as you increase the currency supply then the price of all those scarce desirable things will tend to go up rapidly and the confidence of all of the institutions the corporations and the individual actors and trading partners will will collapse ([Time 0:38:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdd03a7a2a20008a12930))\n- \u003e half the problems in the civilization are due to the fact that our understanding of economics and money is defective 40:30half 50 i don't know it's worth 500 trillion dollars worth of problems like money uh money represents all the economic energy and the civilization and it kind of equates to all the products all the services and all the assets that we have and we're ever gonna have ([Time 0:40:21](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdd4cb54d430008474645))\n- \u003e inflation is completely misunderstood it's a much bigger problem than we understand it to be we need to introduce engineering and science techniques into economics if we want to further the human condition all government policy is inflationary you know and another pernicious myth is uh inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomena so you know a famous quote by milton friedman i believe it's like it's a monetary phenomena that is inflation 42:00comes from expanding the currency supply it's a nice phrase and it's oftentimes quoted by people that are anti-inflation but again it it just signifies a lack of appreciation of what the issue is inflation is if i if i had a currency which was completely non-inflationary if if i never printed another dollar and if i eliminated fractional reserve banking from the face of the earth we'd still have inflation and we'd have 42:30inflation as long as we have government that that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies that are in the in themselves inflationary and generally they all are ([Time 0:41:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdd9fb54d430008474646))\n- \u003e the most pernicious thing is is i get you to misunderstand the phenomena so that even when it's happening to you you don't appreciate that it's a bad thing and you think it's a good thing so if housing prices are going up 20 percent year over year and i say this is great for the american public because most most of them are home owners then i have i've misrepresented a 48:00phenomena inflation is 20 not 7 percent and then i've misrepresented it as being a positive rather than a negative and people will stare at it and you could even show them their house on fire and they would perceive it as being great because it's warming them up and they're going to save on their heat costs ([Time 0:47:33](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cde4aa7a2a20008a12931))\n- \u003e i think what distinguishes uh human beings from all the other creatures on the earth is is our ability to engineer we're engineers 55:30right to solve problems or just build incredible cool things engineering harnessing energy and technique to make the world a better place than you found it ([Time 0:55:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdef2a7a2a20008a12932))\n- \u003e i think there's two big ideas uh the first wave of ideas were digital information and that was the internet way been running since 1990 or so for 30 years and the second wave is digital energy so if i look at digital information this idea that we want to digitally transform a book i'm going to de-materialize every book in this room into bits and then i'm going to deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion people and i'm going to do it for pretty much de minimis electricity if i can dematerialize music books education entertainment maps right that that uh is an incredibly like exothermic transaction it gives it's a crystallization when we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization we give off massive amounts of energy like if you look at what carnegie did the richest man in the world created libraries everywhere at the time and he gave away his entire fortune and now we can give a better library to every six year old for nothing and so what's the value of giving a million books to a eight billion people right that's that's the explosion in prosperity that comes from digital transformation and uh when we do it with maps you know i i transform the map i put it into a car you get in the car and the car drives you where you want to go with the map right and how much better is that than a rand mcnally atlas right here it's like it's like a million times better so the first wave of digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things which are non-conservative that is you know i could take beethoven's fifth symphony played for by the best orchestra in germany and i could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each at less than the cost of the one performance right so so i deliver culture and education and air addition and intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails and the consequences of the human race are first order generally good right the world is a better place it drives growth and you create these trillion dollar entities like apple and amazon and facebook and google and microsoft ([Time 1:06:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce01f2d7ee800082ed9ba))\n- \u003e the impact of a technology is so much greater on the civilization and the human condition than a non-technology that is almost not worth your trouble to bother trying to fix things a conventional way ([Time 1:10:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce058a7a2a20008a12933))\n- \u003e i'll start with tesla he had a very famous quote he said if you understand the universe think in terms of energy vibration and frequency and it gets you thinking about what is the universe and of course the universe is just all energy and then what is matter matter is low frequency energy and what are we you know we're vibrating from you know ashes to ashes dust to dust i can turn a tree into light i can turn light back into a tree if if i consider the entire universe and it's very important because we don't really think this way let's take the new york disco model what it if i walk into a nightclub and there's loud music blaring in new york city what's really going on there right if if you blast out 15 14 billion years ago the universe is formed okay that's a low frequency thing the universe four and a half billion years ago the sun maybe the earth or form the continents are 400 million years old the shift that new york city is on is some hundreds of millions of years but the hudson river is only 20 000 years there's a building that's probably 50 years old there's a company operating that disco or that club which is 5 to 10 years old there's a person a customer walking in there for an experience for a few hours there's music that's uh oscillating it's some kilohertz and then there's light right and you and you have all forms of energy all frequencies right all layered all moving through different medium and the co and how you perceive the world's a question of at what frequency do you want to perceive the world and um i i think that once you start to think that way you you're catalyzed to think about what would digital energy look like and and why would i want it ([Time 1:37:41](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce27c2d7ee800082ed9bb))\n- \u003e the most famous manifestation of digital energy is bitcoin bitcoin's a crypto asset it's a crypto asset that has monetary value ([Time 1:39:58](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce28d14d8ed0008cfca1c))\n- \u003e i'd call it a crypto asset network the goal is to create a billion dollar block of pure energy in cyberspace one that i could that i could then move with no friction at the speed of light right it's it's the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit how do i actually launch something into orbit right how do i launch something into cyberspace that such that it moves friction free and the solution is a you know decentralized proof-of-work network right satoshi's solution was i'm going to establish protocol running on a distributed set of computers that will maintain a constant supply of never more than 21 million bitcoin subdividable by a hundred million satoshis each transferable via transferring private keys now the innovation is uh to create that in a ethical durable fashion right the the ethical innovation is i want it to be property and not a security a bushel of corn an acre of land a stack of lumber and a bar of gold and a bitcoin are all property and that means they're all commonly occurring elements in the world you could call them commodities but commodity is a little bit misleading and i'll tell you why in a second but they're all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government controls them if you have a barrel of oil and you're in ukraine versus russia versus saudi arabia versus the us you have a barrel of oil right and it doesn't matter what the premier in in japan or the mayor of miami beach thinks about your bill they cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil or a cord of wood right and so property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe ([Time 1:40:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce2cc2d7ee800082ed9bc))\n- \u003e if it's a security a security would be an example of a share of a stock or a crypto token controlled by a small team and and in the event that something is a security because some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature character supply then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures ([Time 1:42:58](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce2f014d8ed0008cfca1d))\n- \u003e if you want an ethical path forward uh it needs to be based on common property which is fair and the way you get to a common property is through an open permissionless protocol if it's not open right if it's proprietary and i know what the code says and you don't know what the code says that's that makes it a security if uh if it's uh permissioned if you're not allowed on my network or if you can be censored or booted off my network that also makes it a security um so so when i talk about uh property i mean the challenge here is how do i create something that's equivalent to a barrel of oil in cyberspace and that means it has to be a a non-sovereign bearer instrument open permissionless not censorable right if i could do that then i could deliver you ten thousand dematerialized barrels of oil and you would take settlement of them and you would know that you have possession of that property irregardless of the opinion of any politician or any company or anybody else in the world uh that that's uh a really critical characteristic and and it actually is it's probably one of the fundamental things that makes bitcoin special bitcoin isn't just a crypto asset network it's easy to create a crypto asset network it's very hard uh to create an ethical crypto asset network because you ha you have to create one without any government or corporate corporation or investor exercising into influence to make it successful ([Time 1:46:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce345a7a2a20008a12934))\n- \u003e the bitcoin is the most difficult property that the human race possesses or has yet invented to confiscate and that's by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it by your private key so you know if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head then that would be the highest form of property right because i literally have to crack your head open and read your mind to take it it doesn't mean i couldn't extract it from you under duress but it means that it's harder than every other thing you might own if you and in fact it's exponentially harder if you consider every other thing you might own a car a house a share of stock gold diamonds property rights intellectual property rights movie rights music right anything imaginable they would all be easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize so so digital property and the form of a you know a set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race ([Time 1:49:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce37fa7a2a20008a12935))\n- \u003e if you want to build a better world based on digital energy you need to start with constructing a digital property and i'm using property here open permissionless in a legal sense okay but i would also go to the next step and say property is low frequency money so if you if i give you a million dollars and you want to hold it for a decade you might go buy a house with it right and the house is low frequency money you converted the the million dollars of economic energy into a structure called a house maybe and after a decade you might convert it back into energy you might sell the house for currency and it'll be more worth more or less depending upon the monetary climate ([Time 1:54:15](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce3f72d7ee800082ed9bd))\n- \u003e when you think about uh what's going on here you have extremely low frequency things which we'll call property then you have mid-frequency things i'm going to call a money or currency and then you have high frequency and that's energy and that's why i use the illustration of you got the building you got the light and you got the sound and they're all just energy moving at different frequencies now bitcoin is magical and it's it is truly the innovation it's like a singularity because it represents the first time in the history of human race that we managed to create a digital property properly understood it's it's easy to create something digital right every coupon and every skin on fortnite and roblox and and apple tv credits and all these things they're all digital something but they're securities right shares of stock are securities whenever anybody transfers when you transfer money on paypal or apple pay you're transferring in essence a security or an iou and so transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in in the internet domain or in cyberspace that's a critical thing and and anybody in the crypto world can do that all the cryptos can do that but what they can't do what 99 of them fail to do is be property ([Time 1:55:49](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce42e6c7ab50008e9f03c))\n- \u003e the fact that you can create a hundred trillion dollar layer one that would stand for a hundred years that is the revolutionary breakthrough first time ([Time 2:00:16](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce4b5a7a2a20008a12936))\n- \u003e the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber economy and um we don't want it to move fast what we want what we want is is immortality incorrupt immortal and corruptible indestructible right that that's what you want integrity from the layer one now there's layer two and layer three and layer two i would define as an open permissionless non-custodial protocol that uses uh the underlying layer one token as its as its gas fee ([Time 2:01:57](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce4cf6c7ab50008e9f03d))\n- \u003e lightning network would be an example of a layer two non-custodial so the lightning network will sit on top of uh of layer one it'll sit on top of bitcoin and it solves the what you want to do is solve the problem of it's well and fine i don't want to move a billion dollars every day what i want to move is five dollars a billion times a day so if i want to move five dollars a billion times a day i don't really need to put the entire trillion dollars of assets at risk every time i move five dollars all i really need to do is put a hundred thousand dollars in a channel or a million dollars in a channel and then i do 10 million transactions where i have a million dollars at risk and of course it's it's kind of simple if i if i put if i lower my security requirement by a factor of a million i can probably move the stuff a million times faster and that's how lightning works it's non-custodial because there's no there's no corporation or custodian or counterparty you're trusting right there's a there's the risk of moving through the channel but um lightning is an example of how i go from 350 000 transactions a day to 350 million transactions a day so on that layer too you could move the bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies

free you move it through binance or coin base or cash app so this is a very straightforward thing

society is a polite society right because you have the optionality to withdraw all your assets from the crypto exchange you can enforce fairness and at the point where you disagree with their policies you can within an hour move your assets to another counterparty or take personal custody of those assets and you don't have that option with most other forms of property maybe you don't have as much

#🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: https://dergigi.com/2022/06/27/the-words-we-use-in-bitcoin/?utm_source=pocket_reader\n\n---\n\n# Part 1: The Language Used In Bitcoin\n- “All metaphors are wrong, but some are useful,” to paraphrase George Box. Undoubtedly, many people are confused precisely because of the shortcomings of these metaphors. All the labels that we apply to the various concepts in Bitcoin are wrong, at least a little bit. Some are wrong a lot.\n- Unfortunately, this confusion won’t be going away anytime soon. And more worryingly, this confusion is being weaponized by legislators, politicians, and commentators alike. Those who despise Bitcoin are trying to pass laws and plant ideas in people’s heads that are bastardizing how Bitcoin works, as well as the language we use to describe how it works. Consequently, it would be beneficial to get our language straight.\n\nWallet:\n- A wallet is a piece of software or hardware that makes it easier or more secure to store and/or spend your bitcoin.\n- Here is the gist of it: to create a bitcoin transaction, you need to sign a message with a private key. Consequently, two things are essential for a wallet: key storage and signing.\n- What we have historically called a bitcoin wallet, thus, is just some software that manages and stores keys and allows the user to easily use these keys to sign and broadcast messages.\n- Given that a hardware wallet is nothing but a small device that is used for signing transactions, a more accurate term is “[signing device](https://signingdevice.com/),” which is currently gaining traction thanks to people who understand the technicalities of Bitcoin deeply.\n- In the end, the “wallet” metaphor will always be wrong in a crucial way: your wallet does not actually hold any of your coins. That’s not how Bitcoin works. It might hold your keys, which brings us to the next word.\n\nKey:\n- To create a bitcoin transaction, you use your private key to sign a message. The keys in bitcoin are cryptographic keys, and cryptographic keys can be used to create digital signatures.\n- Consequently, a “key” in bitcoin is more like a pen, not an actual key.\n- To make theft or accidental spending as difficult as possible, keys that give access to large funds are held in “cold” storage. The secret information is disconnected from the internet, held on special signing devices that never touch a general computation device.\n- A “hot wallet,” on the other hand, brings the secret information required to move your sats as close to the network as possible. If you want to spend frequently, your keys have to be readily available.\n- The “key” metaphor, for example, isn’t terribly wrong. We can actually think of signing as unlocking. The underlying elements responsible for spending sats are referred to as [locking and unlocking scripts](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/output_locks), and for good reason. These scripts are small computer programs that define the conditions that are required for certain sets of sats to move. You can think of it like this: those who want to move sats have to solve a cryptographic puzzle. Usually, a private key is required to fulfill the spending condition: the key is the key to the puzzle. So if we think “key to the puzzle,” it’s not even wrong.\n- Two more things: the reason why your private key can be represented as words is that it is, just like everything else in bitcoin, information. And the reason why we call these words a “seed phrase” is because your private key is the seed from which all your other keys and, ultimately, addresses are derived from.\n\nAddress:\n- Because bitcoin transactions do not have a “from address,” even though you might think they do, especially if your mind is poisoned with the “address” metaphor.\n- In Bitcoin, only receiving addresses exist. A transaction does not contain a from address. A transaction only contains the aforementioned scripts, which are challenges and solutions to challenges. If you can solve the challenge, you can move the coins.\n- You can understand Bitcoin and bitcoin transactions in a similar way: transactions can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, i.e., inflows and outflows, to stick with the liquid metaphor. However, there is one important difference: there are no molecules in bitcoin; there is only accounting.\n- There are no molecules in bitcoin because every transaction “destroys” all inputs and creates new outputs. If you are dead-set on thinking about coins, you can think about every transaction as a smelting process. All inputs are liquified in a big furnace, and new coins are created as outputs.\n\nCoins:\n- What we call “coins” only exist by convention. The protocol is oblivious to our notion of coins. It only knows sats and spent or unspent transaction outputs. Spent outputs are inputs of past transactions. If the sum of one or multiple outputs adds up to 100 million sats, we call it “one bitcoin.”\n- Bitcoin is information, not a physical thing. It is teleported at the speed of light, not moved in any physical sense. It is [Magic Internet Money](https://21-ways.com/3/) for a reason, and I’m afraid that we all have to understand its [inner workings](https://21-ways.com/ch0-04-building-blocks/) to a certain degree, especially if we want to be properly equipped to fight against any and all linguistic attacks, present and future.\n\n# Part 2: The Language Used To Attack Bitcoin\n- Money is adversarial by nature because money is used between parties that aren’t fully trusting each other in the first place. Consequently, a monetary system is an adversarial system.\n- Viewed in this light—that Bitcoin is made up of [ideas, people, code, and nodes](https://dergigi.com/2019/05/01/bitcoins-gravity/#loop)—it is easy to see that some attacks would be more obvious than others.\n- An obvious attack would be a software exploit that shuts down a large number of bitcoin nodes, for example. An even more obvious one would be a large-scale attack on its physical infrastructure.\n- But: how do you attack an idea? With bad ideas, that’s how.\n\n“Unhosted Wallet”:\n- Bitcoin wallets are supposed to be unhosted—or, to use a word that wasn’t made up by devilish puppeteers: _independent_. The purpose of Bitcoin is to bring full sovereignty to the individual and to remove all dependencies on trusted third parties. No rulers, no masters, no hosts. Only peers.\n- Instead of using the term “unhosted wallet,” one could refer to regular bitcoin wallets as independent or freedom wallets. The opposite of an independent wallet is a custodial service, which means that you have a permission slip, nothing more. By using a custodial service, you destroy what makes bitcoin valuable in the first place. You revert to the permissioned model of money: a debt relationship between masters and slaves, which is the fiat system we want to move away from. Some have all the power; the users have none.\n- Such a custodial service, a service that they want you to refer to as a “hosted wallet”—but what might be better described as a slave wallet—offers nothing but IOUs: permission slips \u0026 debt certificates that can be revoked, multiplied, re-issued, and destroyed at any time. The slave has nothing; the master has everything.\n- Make no mistake: this is a war of narratives, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Freedom vs. dependency, control vs. self-ownership, reliance vs. responsibility. If anything, a wallet should be self-hosted, and self-hosting is not a crime. However, we shouldn’t think of “hosts” in the first place. A wallet does not need to be hosted because a wallet, as we’ve seen previously, is nothing but a key—private information—combined with hardware or software that allows you to do something with said key, e.g., derive addresses or sign transactions.\n- Having 12 words in your head doesn’t make you the owner of an unhosted brain wallet; that’s ridiculous. You don’t need permission to remember 12 words by heart, and any law that makes the act of remembering 12 words illegal is a very, very, (very!) stupid law.\n- Letting someone else hold your keys destroys all the benefits that bitcoin brings with it. If others could be trusted with our money, we wouldn’t have needed Bitcoin in the first place. And if nobody takes the responsibility of self-custody, Bitcoin will be captured, just like gold before it.\n- Consequently, the term “unhosted wallet” is an attack on Bitcoin that we should take seriously, along with the [implications](https://dergigi.com/2021/08/02/implications-of-outlawing-bitcoin/) that a successful ban would entail. It is a most ingenious and mischievous attack—subtle yet effective, re-framing what a wallet is and should be.\n\nChangeTheCode:\n- Bitcoin, however, is neither slow nor wasteful. Proof-of-work is insanely efficient if your goal is to create a monetary system that is free from politics and secured in a public and transparent manner. If you do not value such a system, it will always seem wasteful.\n\n\"Proof of Stake\":\n- Proof-of-work solved the problem of [telling time](https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/) in a decentralized system, the problem of random selection, the problem of fair issuance, and the problem of unforgeable costliness in the digital realm. It embeds [objective truth](https://dergigi.com/2022/04/03/inalienable-property-rights/#reify) into a blob of data directly, which is why it is trustless and reliable. The information “speaks for itself,” to quote Satoshi.\n- Proof-of-stake, on the other hand, has no objective truth, no objective time, no random selection, no fair issuance, no outside cost, no operational cost, and centralizes over time. It is the perpetual motion machine of consensus mechanisms, which is to say that it isn’t a consensus mechanism at all. It is rotten at its core because it relies on trust through and through.\n\n# Conclusion\n- Bitcoin is about freedom and self-sovereignty, not about asking for permission. It is about independence and verifiable truth; extreme ownership and responsibility; hope and human rights.\n- The best way to fight bad ideas and bad terminology is with good ideas and good terminology. Thus, we should all make an effort to call things by their proper names, try to understand their inner workings, and explain them in simple terms to others.\n- Bitcoin is a return to sanity, one that is desperately needed in the insane world of QE infinity and negative interest rates. The tragicomedy of our current financial system reads like the introduction to a game show: “Whose deficit is it anyway? An economy where everything is made up and the points don’t matter.”\n- The points in Bitcoin _do_ matter, as do the words that we use to describe it. Bitcoin is truthful and precise in its [speech](https://dergigi.com/speech), and we should strive to be too.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Blockchain-Crypto/What-Is-DAO-in-Crypto-Decentralized-Autonomous-Organization-DAO-Explained-in-7-Min-Simplilearn":{"title":"","content":"tags:

If you’re a knowledgeable person using crypto for some legitimate reason, you’ll use some well-regarded crypto platform and probably not get scammed. If you live in a developed country with a good banking system, and you have no legitimate use cases, your engagement with cryptocurrency may be entirely through clicking on spam emails that say “MAKE 1000% MONTHLY RETURNS WITH MOONCOIN” and wiring them your life savings.

And this has pretty much the same effect.\n  The most obvious example of this is the way [Paypal bans sex workers](https://tryst.link/blog/financial-discrimination-against-sex-workers-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/) (including sometimes confiscating the money in their accounts). I don’t think the CEO of Paypal is personally a prude. I think he’s afraid that he’ll get in trouble with the government if he looks like he’s soft on “public indecency”. Without any official diktats that could become a Supreme Court case, the government successfully makes sex work punishingly hard.\n  Recently I’ve seen this expand from sex work to [erotic fiction](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/payment-processors-are-still-policing-your-sex-life) to [medical marijuana](https://mgmagazine.com/cannabis-news/cannabis-payment-problem/?doing_wp_cron=1669442490.3007938861846923828125) to [expressing opinions dubbed “misinformation”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/10/paypal-faces-backlash-after-floating-fines-sharing-misinformation/).

The only excuse is that it’s decentralized. This means you can use it for all of those cool things - sending remittances, circumventing corrupt banking systems, resisting authoritarian governments - that are hard to do with regular money. Of *course* subjecting yourself to a difficult constraint is going to be harder than not doing that! You don’t hate the International Space Station for being worse than houses on Earth.

If you use crypto anyway, it will be worse than your regular financial system, because it’s trading off many things you need (efficiency, speed, safety, the good kinds of regulation) for something you don’t need (avoiding the bad kinds of regulation).

the stories that the culture tells in the middle is the structure which is the institutions and the rules and the laws and the economic system but underpinning it all is the infrastructure which is the energy and 08:30the throughput and the waste streams and how the system functions and so you and i both agree that what's coming in the coming decades is we're going to have to solve all three of

我們作為個人，作為家庭，作為小型企業，作為公司，作為民族國家，我們都在努力使金融盈餘貨幣利潤最大化，而這些利潤與能源息息相關，與碳氫化合物息息相關，我們不能停止或放緩，因為這個系統需要增長來繼續，來償還過去的金融債權，所以我們所做的是通過各種規則的改變來踢開罐子，比如債務等等。 我們必須繼續增長，但增長是與能源聯繫在一起的，而我們現在繼續這樣做的唯一方法是中央銀行和政府吹大他們的資產負債表，以保持商品和服務流向大量人口，所以發生了什麼，是市場或比人類個人更高層次的系統的向下因果關係嗯，對我們的行為施加了16:30的規則，這是我們無法控制的，所以我們事實上是人類現在是作為一個能源饑餓的超級生物體在運作。\n  we as uh individuals as families as small 15:30businesses as corporations as as nation states we are trying to maximize financial surplus money profits which are tethered to energy which are tethered to hydrocarbons and we can't stop or slow down because the system requires growth to continue and to pay off the financial claims from the past and so what we're doing is we're kicking the can with various rule changes uh with debt etc 16:00and we have to continue to grow but the growth is tethered to energy and the only way that we're continuing this right now is by central banks and governments blowing up their balance sheets in order to keep goods and services flowing to large populations so what has happened is the market or the downward causation of a higher level system than than human individuals um is imposing

所以你在看人類技術的方式，從石器開始，然後是農業技術，然後是工業技術，使我們能夠從環境中獲取比其他動物更多的能量，以便能夠做未來的剩餘物，然後能夠與其他人競爭未來的剩餘物，使人口更快地增長，這種熱力學與競爭性相結合的定義特徵是多麼基本，或者說是熱力學與進化理論相結合的，技術最終發展了我們提取能源和使用能源的能力，以獲得更多的東西，這增加了我們在戰爭和經濟戰爭中獲勝的能力，以及其他的東西，推動了軍備競賽的能力，更快地提取外部的眼睛等，最終推動了整個地球的脆弱性。\n  one of the deepest definitions of life is actually an entropy pump something that can take more energy from the environment and externalize its entropy 18:00and so then you're looking at the way that human technology starting with stone tools and then agricultural tech and then industrial tech allowed us to harvest more energy from our environment than other animals to be able to do future surplus stuff and then to be able to compete with others over the future surplus and grow populations faster and how how fundamental of a kind of defining characteristic this thermodynamic combined with competitive or like it's a thermodynamic and then evolutionary theory together 18:30where the tech ends up evolving our capacity to extract energy and use energy for more stuff which increases our

在自然界中，那些能夠捕獲更多能量的生態系統具有優勢，這最終導致了一個叫做克裡伯定律的比例法則，即動物的能量使用比例是其大小的四分之三，這對小鼠和藍鯨都適用，因此，生物體的大小決定了它使用多少能量。 如果你把地球上所有的國家加在一起，全球GDP的斜率正好是GDP規模的三分之二，雖然不完全一樣，但這種關係是成立的，即使是作為一個生物有機體，整個人類經濟也是如此\n  in nature those those um ecosystems that are able to capture more energy have an advantage and it it ends up resulting in a scaling law called klieber's law which is that animals energy use scales to the three-quarter power of their size and this works for mice all the way up to blue whales and so the size of the organism show dictates how much energy it uses 20:00well lo and behold if you aggregate all the countries in the earth the the slope of global gdp is right around the the size of the gdp to the two-thirds power it's not exactly the same but the relationship holds even as a biological

穀物比你可以獵取的肉類和漿果等更容易儲存，這意味著你可以度過饑荒，更快地增長人口，然後如果你的人口增長更快，你就可以贏得的部落戰爭，現在你也有了更多值得另一個部落入侵的東西，所以現在你必須進行防禦和軍事，以及所有與擁有剩餘物有關的事情，現在第一次出現了需要處理剩餘物的經濟學，所以私有財產所有權和繼承權以及所有這些東西，這就像它是一個大問題，特別是嗯過渡是當我們的物種在伊甸園吃蘋果的時候。\n  that grains were more storable than say what you could hunt and gather meats and berries and stuff more storable means you can make it through the famine and grow the population faster and then if you grow the population faster you can win a 22:00tribal warfare and now you also have more stuff that is worth invading for another tribe so now you have to do defense and military and all the things that go along with having that surplus and now for the first time the economics of needing to deal with surplus come about so private property ownership and inheritance and all those things it was like it was a big deal that particular um transition was when that was when our species ate the apple in the garden of eden

這也是人類世的開始，因為在這之前，你希望自然界基本保持狩獵和採集的方式，你第一次想開始砍伐一個地區，把它變成農業用地，種植大量的穀物，因為在採集環境中，沒有足夠的穀物是有用的，你必須在它後面劃線種植，然後能夠拖動犁，所以你可以認為人類世的開始和提取儲存能源的開始是相應的。\n  that was also kind of in one 22:30way the beginning of the anthropocene because before that you want nature to be pretty much the way it is to hunt and gather from this the first time you want to start clear cutting an area to turn it into agriculture land for lots of grain because in a gather environment there's not enough grain to be useful you've got to row crop it to then be able to drag a plow behind it so you can kind of consider the beginning of the anthropocene and the beginning of extraction of stored energy corresponding together ([Time 0:22:29](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e6f317834a0009f93832))\n-

inequality really started to occur we were always in equal in terms of status and uh respect and things like that but we were always incredibly equal in terms of consumption because we didn't have anything we didn't have stuff to carry around with us everyone's uh actual consumption of of outside of the body calories was pretty much the same but once we started 23:30soaring surplus that's when the uh the hierarchies um started yeah the beginning of the thing we call civilization that started scaling well beyond the dunbar number which equaled how to domesticate wild-type humans that would

體外能量是我們消耗的能量，但不是通過進食，而是在體外，所以在體內，美國人平均消耗2500卡路里，在體外，美國人平均每天消耗超過20萬卡路里，在燈光、飛機、購物中心、圖書館和公共汽車等，所以我們是唯一在體外大量使用能量的物種，這只是因為我們在使用這個儲存的碳氫化合物庫\n  exosomatic energy is energy that we consume but not by eating it's outside of the body so inside the body the average american consumes like 2500 calories outside the body the average american consumes over 200 000 kilocalories per day 25:00um in the lights and the airplanes and the shopping centers and the libraries and the buses etc so we're the only species that massively uses energy outside of the body and that is only made available by the fact that we're accessing this pool of stored hydrocarbons ([Time 0:24:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e7688f534000092270a6))\n- \u003e 今天，我們身體中60%的氮氣有來自天然氣的化學特徵，所以我們直接從化石碳和碳氫化合物中大量增加了食物供應。\n  sixty percent of the nitrogen in our bodies today has a chemical signature coming from natural gas so we've massively boosted the food supply

一些國家已經將其經濟產出與能源使用脫鉤，有一種東西叫做GDP的能源強度，即我們需要多少能源來產生一美元的GDP，美國和英國都是以服務為基礎的經濟體，因此，我們實際上已經通過使用更少的能源來更有效地創造GDP，但從超級生物體的角度來看，重要的是我們未來的可持續性，我們的生態圈，我們的氣候，我們的海洋是整個人類系統的作用，整個人類系統是非常緊密地聯繫在一起，超過99%，因為美國和英國在美國，平均每個美國人消耗57桶石油價值的化石燃料，但我們從中國再進口17桶左右，我們不從中國進口石油，而是進口電視和塑料沙拉碗，以及類似的東西，這些能源是在中國燃燒的，我們為它支付美元，它來到這裡，所以它是我們的，它是我們消費的一部分。 我想說的是，在過去的五到八年裡，全球範圍內的能源和GDP似乎有了一些脫鉤，這是金融市場的一個偽命題，因為中央銀行在GDP計算中對養老基金的處理方式，導致了金融市場的大規模關閉，如果我想說如果或者我想說當股票市場重新調整的時候，這種關係將在99%以上收緊。\n  some countries have decoupled their economic output from their energy use there's something called the energy intensity of gdp which is how much energy we need to generate a dollar of gdp the united states the united kingdom are service-based economies 36:00so we actually have gotten much more efficient generating gdp by using less energy but the the important thing from the super organism vantage point which is our future sustainability our ecosphere our climate our oceans is what the whole human system does and the whole human system is is extremely tightly tethered over 99 percent because the united states and the united kingdom 36:30um in in america the average american consumes 57 barrels of oil worth of fossil fuels per but we import another 17 or so from china in we don't import the oil from china we import the televisions and the plastic salad bowls and and things like that the energy was burned in china we paid dollars for it and it comes here so it's our it's part of our consumptive 37:00footprint but the bottom line is that um globally energy and gdp are tightly linked one other caveat i would say there the last five to eight years it seems to be globally a little bit more decoupling and this is an artifact of this massive uh off in the financial markets due to central banks because of the way that pension funds are treated in the gdp calculations and when and if 37:30i would say if or i would say when stock markets recalibrate that relationship will tighten back up around the the 99 plus percent ([Time 0:35:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e9a58f53400009227daf))\n- \u003e 這種富裕的國家不做自己的製造、生產和廢物管理，主要出口科技服務，這讓它看起來有38%。 相對於國內的能源使用，它有更高的GDP，但這是因為它只是把所有的高能耗的東西出口到其他地方的製造業，然後再進口產品，我發現這一點，我發現很多東西都是這樣。你可以拿一個國家來說，它有一個很好的精靈係數，但這只是因為它把所有的廉價勞動力出口到其他地方，它依靠這些勞動力來獲得它的東西，所以你就像你沒有一個好的精靈係數，你的經濟不平等是需要使你的文明run仍然很高，因為你只是從其他地方的廉價勞動力中購買你的。\n  this kind of wealthy nation that doesn't do its own manufacturing and production and waste management and largely exports kind of tech services can make it seem 38:30like it has higher gdp relative to its own domestic energy use but it's because it's just exporting all of its like really high energy intensive stuff to the manufacturing that's happening somewhere else it then imports the products of and i find this like i find this for so many things you can take a country that has a good genie coefficient but it's just because it exported all the cheap labor to somewhere else that it depends upon to get its stuff so you're like you don't really have a good genie coefficient your economic inequality that's needed to make your civilization 39:00run is still very high because you just buy your from cheap labor from somewhere else ([Time 0:38:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea1d8f53400009227db3))\n- \u003e 威廉-斯特凡-斯坦利-傑文斯是19世紀的經濟學家，他自相矛盾地預言，蒸汽機的巨大發明使事物比馬匹或之前的東西更有效率，但自相矛盾的是，即使它更有效率，人類最終會使用更多的能源，因為大多數人可以買得起東西，事情會做得更快，他們會建造更多的蒸汽機，這當然是事實。\n  william stavan stanley jevins was a 19th century economist who paradoxically predicted that the massive 41:00beneficial invention of the steam engine which made things way more efficient than horses uh or what came before paradoxically would end up having humans use a lot more energy even though it was more efficient that's because most more people could afford things uh things would be done faster they would build more of these steam engines and that is of course what happened ([Time 0:40:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea6e8f53400009227db4))\n- \u003e 首先，技術是通貨緊縮的，因為市場體系和創新以及人們被激勵去做更好的發明，所以隨著時間的推移，像平板電視這樣的技術含量高的東西會越來越便宜，直到漸進式的你無法得到更便宜的東西，所以技術是通貨緊縮的。 與此相對應的是耗竭，即我們已經獲得了最好的化石碳氫化合物，這是我們經濟的主要投入，然後我們必須獲得下一個更難的部分，等等，最終什麼都沒有了，但我們還沒有到那一步，所以技術通縮和資源投入通脹這兩種力量正在進行鬥爭\n  first of all technology is deflationary because the market system and innovation and people are incentivized to make better inventions so over time things that are tech heavy like flat screen tvs will get cheaper and cheaper until they asymptotically you just can't get them any cheaper but so tech is deflationary 42:00counter to that is depletion which is that we've accessed the best fossil hydrocarbons that are the main input to our economies and then we have to access the next harder tranche etc eventually there's nothing left but we're not there yet so these two forces between technological deflation and resource input inflation are are battling ([Time 0:41:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea8fa5d5070009ec4098))\n- \u003e 第一類技術，第一類是使我們的能源使用，我們的能源捕獲更有效的方法，例如，我們可以開發新的太陽能電池，更有效率，或者我們可以採取一個發電廠，我們輸入的能源量，我們得到更多的電力，第二類技術是發明呃新的方法呃或方法人類使用能源的方式，我們過去是手工操作，現在我們有機器來做，或者像facebook這樣的新方式，我們以前從來沒有過，現在它是一個新的能源使用載體，所以這是第二類技術，主導著我們的全球技術組合，最終建立越來越多的東西，成為明年更多能源使用的載體，傑文悖論意味著如果某樣東西變得更有效率，人們就會購買更多的東西，或者他們在那件東西上省下的錢會在沃爾瑪買一些從中國買來的東西，所以最終發生的情況是，效率在很大程度上是為超級有機體服務的，所以只要我們把GDP作為我們的文化目標，市場系統和個人以及公司和企業通過GDP優化44:00的利潤，效率只是在一個正反饋循環中為這個系統提供更多資金，我們在未來會使用更多能源\n  there's really two categories of technology the first tech the first 42:30category is ways to make our energy use our energy capture more efficient for example we can develop new solar voltaic cells that are more efficient or we could take a power plant and the amount of energy that we input we get more electricity out of that the second type of technology is inventing uh new ways uh or or ways 43:00that humans use energy that we used to do manually and now we have machines do it or new ways like facebook that we never had before and now it's a new vector for energy use so it's that second category of technology that dominates our our global technology portfolio which ends up building more and more things that are a vector for more energy use next year now jevin's paradox means 43:30that if something gets more efficient the people will buy more of it or the savings that they have from saving money on that thing will be spent at walmart on some things that they bought from china so what ends up happening is efficiency is in service of the super organism to a large extent so efficiency as long as we have gdp as our cultural goal where the market system and individual and and uh corporations and and businesses optimize 44:00profits via gdp efficiency will just feed more money into that system in a positive feedback loop and we'll use more energy in the future ([Time 0:42:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eac8c83dd60009380ff3))\n- \u003e 只要你的效率提高了，你就會得到一個全新的盈利潛力，而這些潛力是不存在的，我們最終會進入這些潛力，所以只要有一個內嵌的增長義務或圍繞淨增長的激勵措施，效率是能夠成為可持續發展的一種方式的想法是不可行的。\n  anytime you get an increase in 45:30efficiency you get a whole new uh profitability potentials that weren't there and we end up going into those so the idea that efficiency is a way of being able to become sustainable doesn't work as long as there is an ins either an embedded growth obligation or an incentive around net growth ([Time 0:45:27](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eb09a5d5070009ec409a))\n- \u003e 所以我們在這個地方，在GDP和能源之間存在著這種聯繫，我們在能源上得到的回報越來越少，對資本的要求是指數級的，僅僅是因為利息，我們明年必須有比今年更多的資本，因為我們的金融系統的性質是這樣的，所以開始變得越來越大，需要繼續擁有更多的資本，這意味著需要繼續擁有更多的能源，越來越不容易獲得能源。 所以必須對海上石油鑽探和壓裂等進行技術創新，但最終你會用完這些，然後會有一個偉大的清算，所以這就是你所說的，還沒有一個偉大的清算，因為中間的步驟是你用中央銀行的擔保和救助之類的東西來掩蓋這個問題，但是是的，最終會有一個偉大的清算，我指的是偉大的簡化，是的，最終根據定義我們將不得不有一個後增長經濟\n  so we're at this place where there's this this pegging between gdp and energy we're getting a diminishing return on our energy source and there's an exponential requirement on capital simply because of interest right we have to have more capital next year than we have the capital this year for the nature of the how we set up the financial system so then there starts to become this larger delta of need to keep having more capital which means need to keep having more energy have less and less easy to access energy 48:00so have to technologically innovate offshore oil drilling and fracking and things but eventually you kind of run out of that and then there's a great reckoning so this is what you call it there's not yet a great reckoning because the intermediate step is you paper over that with central bank guarantees and and bailouts and and things like that but yes eventually there's a great reckoning which i'm referring to as the great simplification and yes eventually by definition we will have to have a post-growth

我認為當我們沒有能力用債務和中央銀行的擔保來掩蓋這些生物物理現象時，我們最終會萎縮，而且這也是你最初的前提，我認為我們必須預測可能發生的事情，並嘗試讓我們的系統彎曲而不是斷裂，因為斷裂涉及到許多X-的類別。 彎曲意味著它為人類提供了另一種途徑，使其走向更理智、更持久、更有意義的文化，我們可以做到這一點的方法之一是對我們經濟的主要投入進行適當的定價，如果我們能夠不僅對碳，而且對所有不可再生的投入徵稅，那麼在人類的時間尺度上，任何不可 在人類的時間尺度上，這將是天然氣或銅或化石水的含水層或沙子或任何類似的東西 嗯，然後同時取消對人類的稅收 我們現在95％的稅收是對人類的勞動，所以如果我們刪除所有這些 你一年賺5萬，你保持你的5萬，你不必支付任何稅 但如果你買一個蘋果手機，有各種呃複雜昂貴的機器 呃，金屬和礦物在裡面，它可能需要兩三千美元，而現在是五百美元，所以如果我們有正確的價格，我們將能夠更好地以一種與我們的未來相一致的方式進行創新，我們可能會節約，我們不會只是嗯，飛到巴哈馬的旅行團或拉斯維加斯，或只是每天從亞馬遜購買，讓我們多一點多巴胺。\n  i think we will eventually shrink when we run out of the ability to paper over these biophysical phenomenon with debt and central bank guarantees and too big to fail and artificially low interest rates and things like that and so this gets to your original premise i think we have to anticipate what might happen and try to have our system bend and not break because break gets into many of the categories of the x-risk that you're so fluent in bend means it gives humans another pathway forward towards a saner longer lasting more meaningful culture and one of the ways we could do that is get the prices right

 this is why the jeffers paradox is so fundamental is ultimately the dollars are seeking returns anywhere and they'll seek the highest returns possible but they'll seek any returns too there will be a power law distribution on return so i can get 1000x return of course i'll get it but if i can get a three percent return i'll you know a large amount of capital we'll do that so when you get increases

has to be on an exponential growth curve up you can't do exponential extraction of energy forever and we're already on a diminishing return on hydrocarbons meaning uh hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons

technology is just values neutral i can use a hammer to build a house for the homeless or i can use it as a weapon but there's no value embedded value system embedded in the hammer it's just the value system the person that chooses to use it and that would be the same with everything in our industrial supply chain and they either have that view or some people have the view that tech is fundamentally values positive that's 33:00kind of the generals um hobbesian pinker and you know gatesand kind of view of the dialectic of progress that tech only gets selected for and the market only upregulates it if it's solving some real problem that people want and they're willing to pay for so of course it is inherently liberating humans from problems that allows them to expand and so it's fundamentally net positive um then there are the lewis mumfords and everyone who have critiqued why that's not true 33:30and many people then can go in a luddite direction of like no tech actually messes up religions and societies and ecosystems and so tech is fundamentally net negative to our value systems i would say we're arguing in this paper all three of those are naive tech is values affective it affects it in a complex set of positive and negative ways and very much in the same way that tech will produce some positive thing in the physical world but also externalize some negative things it doesn't have one effect it has a complex set of effects and we need to factor the positive and 34:00negative externalities in addition to the thing it was supposed to do and factor that into

human behavior now rather than being a hunter gatherer i'm 39:00beating a box all day right and i'm branding and binding its nose and whatever else i have to do because it codes a pattern of human behavior it codes a pattern of values in human psyche and be than to do that in scale means it codes a culture and so animism was universal in south america north america africa europe whatever it was pretty universal and animism died following the ox driven plow almost everywhere because you can't be animistic and be an 39:30animal all day long and so kind of some version of man men's dominion

systems from all life is sentient we're not the web of life we're merely a stranded at whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves two man's dominion over it's all here for us you know that kind of thing that was the result of a value system embedded in the technology itself inexorably embedded not based on how 40:00people used it but embedded in it and then some historians go on to argue that not only did the plow do that regarding animism it also went from where previous to the plow societies and david graber's new book adds a lot of nuance i'm at i'm doing like a hundred thousand foot view but that whether women were gathering and men were hunting or women were doing horticulture and men were hunting women could still provide half the food stuffs men had to do the plow because women would miscarry men's upper body strength 40:30mattered so now men provided the meat stuff and the vegetative stuff women moved in the house as a result you also move from a distribution of male and female gods to mostly male gods so the thing that is called patriarchy oft is often attributed as a rising is a byproduct of the plow also and the movement from all the food that gives life being male derived rather than female because again of the physicality uh involved in the nature of the plow then of course that gives you surplus and before that you didn't have surplus so you have these you didn't have private property ownership you have 41:00these different kinds of sharing systems now with much more surplus you could grow the population a lot faster now you've got larger than dunbar number kind of empires now you've got um radical wealth inequality and class systems so we're like are there arguments about why that ended up requiring more formal institutionalization of marriage on larger scale because now i own stuff that i could pass on to my kids when i died so i wanted more paternity certainty so everything from like institutionalization of marriage to 41:30views

giving rise to the protestant revolution and democracy and because without the printing press you can't have everybody have a newspaper and have books so only a nobility has access and we can go on and on and look at how each 42:00piece of tech if you use it in code's game theoretic power where those who use it will get ahead and those who don't will end up not making it through history so it's obligate it codes behavior as a result it codes values and minds as a result of doing that in scale it codes cultures so it's not just that we have to have values from something like religion or whatever to make us use tech well it's the tech is directly creating our values also so we have to design tech that in mind not just how does this tech 42:30externalize costs in the physical world

The human body is supposed to be made up of cells living harmoniously and pooling their resources for the greater good of the organism.

The “race to the bottom” describes [a political situation where](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom) some jurisdictions lure businesses by promising lower taxes and fewer regulations.

Once one agent learns how to become more competitive by sacrificing a common value, all its competitors must also sacrifice that value or be outcompeted and replaced by the less scrupulous. Therefore, the system is likely to end up with everyone once again equally competitive, but the sacrificed value is gone forever.

But right now students’ incentive is to go to the most prestigious college they can get into so employers will hire them – whether or not they learn anything. Employers’ incentive is to get students from the most prestigious college they can so that they can defend their decision to their boss if it goes wrong – whether or not the college provides value added. And colleges’ incentive is to do whatever it takes to get more prestige, as measured in *US News and World Report* rankings – whether or not it helps students. Does this lead to huge waste and poor education? Yes. Could the Education God notice this and make some Education Decrees that lead to a vastly more efficient system? Easily! But since there’s no Education God everybody is just going to follow their own incentives, which are only partly correlated with education or efficiency.

There’s lots of publication bias, statistics are done in a confusing and misleading way out of sheer inertia, and replications often happen very late or not at all. And sometimes someone will say something like “I can’t believe people are too dumb to fix Science. All we would have to do is require early registration of studies to avoid publication bias, turn this new and powerful statistical technique into the new standard, and accord higher status to scientists who do replication experiments.

They just have an incentive to want everybody else to do it, at which point they would follow along. And no individual journal has an incentive to unilaterally switch to early registration and publishing negative results, since it would just mean their results are less interesting than that other journal who only publishes ground-breaking discoveries. From within the system, everyone is following their own incentives and will continue to do so.

In theory, it should be *really hard* to have a democratically elected body that maintains a 9% approval rating for more than one election cycle.

In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out.

New ways of copying agents to increase the population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus’ unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors, will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on human values. And our coordination power will not be nearly up to the task, assuming somthing much more powerful than all of us combined doesn’t show up and crush our combined efforts with a wave of its paw. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnkhegqx2wendvdjffcrve5))\n- Warg Franklin analyzes the same situation and does a little better. He names “the Four Horsemen of Gnon” – capitalism, war, evolution, and memetics – the same processes I talked about above. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmg5rta1m40sjdwqy72nbj))\n- Each component of Gnon detailed above had and has a strong hand in creating us, our ideas, our wealth, and our dominance, and thus has been good in that respect, but we must remember that [he] can and will turn on us when circumstances change. Evolution becomes dysgenic, features of the memetic landscape promote ever crazier insanity, productivity turns to famine when we can no longer compete to afford our own existence, and order turns to chaos and bloodshed when we neglect martial strength or are overpowered from outside. These processes are not good or evil overall; they are neutral, in the horrorist Lovecraftian sense of the word […]\n  Instead of the destructive free reign of evolution and the sexual market, we would be better off with deliberate and conservative patriarchy and eugenics driven by the judgement of man within the constraints set by Gnon. Instead of a “marketplace of ideas” that more resembles a festering petri-dish breeding superbugs, a rational theocracy. Instead of unhinged techno-commercial exploitation or naive neglect of economics, a careful bottling of the productive economic dynamic and planning for a controlled techno-singularity. Instead of politics and chaos, a strong hierarchical order with martial sovereignty. These things are not to be construed as complete proposals; we don’t really know how to accomplish any of this. They are better understood as goals to be worked towards. This post concerns itself with the “what” and “why”, rather than the “how”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmdfsxev1twtrv1kztfets))\n- This seems to me the strongest argument for authoritarianism. Multipolar traps are likely to destroy us, so we should shift the tyranny-multipolarity tradeoff towards a rationally-planned garden, which requires centralized monarchical authority and strongly-binding traditions.

He says we do all these stupid things like divert useful resources to feed those who could never survive on their own, or supporting the poor in ways that encourage dysgenic reproduction, or allowing cultural degeneration to undermine the state. This means our society is denying natural law, basically listening to Nature say things like “this cause has this effect” and putting our fingers in our ears and saying “NO IT DOESN’T”. Civilizations that do this too much tend to decline and fall, which is Gnon’s fair and dispassionately-applied punishment for violating His laws. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnpenrdye5qanwsvz190d2m))\n- But a brief digression into social evolution. Societies, like animals, evolve. The ones that survive spawn memetic descendants – for example, the success of Britan allowed it to spin off Canada, Australia, the US, et cetera. Thus, we expect societies that exist to be somewhat optimized for stability and prosperity. I think this is one of the strongest conservative arguments. Just as a random change to a letter in the human genome will probably be deleterious rather than beneficial since humans are a complicated fine-tuned system whose genome has been pre-optimized for survival – so most changes to our cultural DNA will disrupt some institution that evolved to help Anglo-American (or whatever) society outcompete its real and hypothetical rivals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmjdyqk6szy4e0atpp0bqz))\n- The liberal counterargument to that is that evolution is [a blind idiot alien god](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/) that optimizes for stupid things and has no concern with human value. Thus, the fact that some species of wasps paralyze caterpillars, lay their eggs inside of it, and have its young devour the still-living paralyzed caterpillar from the inside doesn’t set off evolution’s moral sensor, because evolution doesn’t *have* a moral sensor because evolution doesn’t care. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmkekee6fjnscf40dyb6qb))\n- Suppose that in fact patriarchy is adaptive to societies because it allows women to spend all their time bearing children who can then engage in productive economic activity and fight wars. The social evolutionary processes that cause societies to adopt patriarchy *still* have exactly as little concern for its moral effects on women as the biological evolutionary processes that cause wasps to lay their eggs in caterpillars. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmmse1w24pmapdtr7ztb0m))\n- Evolution doesn’t care. But we do care. There’s a tradeoff between Gnon-compliance – saying “Okay, the strongest possible society is a patriarchal one, we should implement patriarchy” and our human values – like women who want to do something other than bear children. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmmz5papm8m839chvzmhfh))\n- Too far to one side of the tradeoff, and we have unstable impoverished societies that die out for going against natural law. Too far to the other side, and we have lean mean fighting machines that are murderous and miserable. Think your local anarchist commune versus Sparta. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmq9kx89x1p1bna3ez030m))\n- And then there’s us. Man has his own telos, when he is allowed the security to act and the clarity to reason out the consequences of his actions. When unafflicted by coordination problems and unthreatened by superior forces, able to act as a gardener rather than just another subject of the law of the jungle, he tends to build and guide a wonderful world for himself. He tends to favor good things and avoid bad, to create secure civilizations with polished sidewalks, beautiful art, happy families, and glorious adventures. I will take it as a given that this telos is identical with “good” and “should”.\n  Thus we have our wildcard and the big question of futurism. Will the future be ruled by the usual four horsemen of Gnon for a future of meaningless gleaming techno-progress burning the cosmos or a future of dysgenic, insane, hungry, and bloody dark ages; or will the telos of man prevail for a future of meaningful art, science, spirituality, and greatness? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnp857a542azhq39gxkfebb))\n- The project of civilization [is] for man to graduate from the metaphorical savage, subject to the law of the jungle, to the civilized gardener who, while theoretically still subject to the law of the jungle, is so dominant as to limit the usefulness of that model.\n  This need not be done globally; we may only be able to carve out a small walled garden for ourselves, but make no mistake, even if only locally, the project of civilization is to capture Gnon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnp89era8rbg84fw19cp2z8))\n- I can imagine ways that a “rational theocracy” and “conservative patriarchy” might not be terrible to live under, given exactly the right conditions. But you don’t get to choose exactly the right conditions. You get to choose the extremely constrained set of conditions that “capture Gnon”. As outside civilizations compete against you, your conditions will become more and more constrained. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnpdee89909thzd9mscywgx))\n- But the current rulers of the universe – call them what you want, Moloch, Gnon, whatever – want us dead, and with us everything we value. Art, science, love, philosophy, consciousness itself, the entire bundle. And since I’m not down with that plan, I think defeating them and taking their place is a pretty high priority.\n  The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values.

Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by definition they’ll be able to design machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so that it can suppress any competition – including competition for its title of most powerful entity – permanently. In the very near future, we are going to lift *something* to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it’s on our side, it can *kill Moloch dead*.

It was just what happened to them automatically when they wanted their country to stop being a hellhole.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmysadt3gbf0aq956qd314qv))\n- This is probably because many features of liberal democracy are adaptations to our current technological climate. For example, women’s lib seems like an adaptation both to the Sexual Revolution and to the demographic transition where people are no longer having like twenty children all the time.

In order to regain them, you’re going to have to roll back the Industrial Revolution. Needless to say, that makes fighting against the demographic transition look easy.

是的，所以也許我們需要這樣的東西 我們知道理想是什麼，在某種意義上是一個神聖的理想，我們沒有人能夠達到它 但是在這個理想周圍必須有一個空間，人們的個體差異、缺陷、特殊性和特異性不會被如此嚴厲地對待，這本身就會產生反作用，這是對微弱的讚美的損害\n  we have this notion that's rife in our culture let's say that's insisted upon that all families are equally are equal and i understand the emphasis on that from the let's call it the tolerance perspective 33:00but i think that it's badly flawed in one manner and i think this will be the hardest thing probably for us to discuss is that you can't flatten out distinctions without a tremendous loss and i don't think it's possible to dispense with the ideal of heterosexual monogamy now as the ideal yes that's so if we think well there's an ideal individual who's responsible and mature and far-seeing and honest an honest trader a good player uh an honorable person honorable 33:30decent person and then there's the minimal requirement for a family that's ideal and that's something approximating heterosexual long-term heterosexual monogamy and maybe you have two decent people united together and then there's a firm platform for children now the problem with that as an ideal is that we all fall short of the ideal and so right half 40 of people are going to get divorced and of the people who don't get divorced a good percentage of them are 34:00in pretty damn miserable marriages now that doesn't condemn marriage but it does show how difficult

yeah so maybe we need something like well we know what the ideal is it's a divine ideal in some sense in that none of us can live up to it but then there has to be a space around that ideal where the

在充滿互動性的集體意識、以及必然存在的私人（意識）版本之間，存在著一種起伏和流動。在集體思考不被允許時（可以稱之為思想的黑暗時代）仍然堅持獨立思考的人，我稱之為「火炬的守護者」。\n\n- 不幸地，我們正處於一個奇怪的黑暗時代：在某方面，我們從未有過這麼適合相互交流的科技工具，然而公開透明的對話卻也前所未有地不被歡迎。我們現在需要找到一種機制來重新啟動這個對話，而這必須從這個問題開始：我們是否能夠同意「對話」存在著無可取代的重要性。\n\n\n# 社會變革\n\n- 僅僅因為你搞清楚事物的一項功能，並不意味著你已經搞清楚了它的所有功能——一如[[切斯特頓的圍欄]]——有太多的現代人草率地推翻那些過去運作良好的事物，只為了支持新的、但沒有證據顯示能長久矗立的措施。\n\n# 教育\n\n- \u003e 我們過度保護我們的孩童。他們生活在一個——在很大的程度上——風險已經被清除到所剩無幾的世界裡，於是當他們面臨風險的時候，他們沒有工具來管理、面對它，所以他們才會要求安全感、要求有人可以給他們一個跟成長過程中一樣安全的長大世界——這是不可能的。這不但對他們一點好處也沒有，我們甚至因為這樣的要求而撕裂了社會。\n  \n- 我們總是知道，一個人十八歲生日那天並沒有發生任何神奇的事情、突然之間你就便成了成年人；現實是這是一系列、漸進的、演化的過程，它需要經驗的累積。否則，我們就會有很多——我們其實已經有太多——生理上成年、殫心理上還是小孩的人。\n\n- 先人的文化傳統、跟他們所身處的環境是完全或幾乎對等的。意思是說，正確的教訓會自動被習得，因為那是一個危險的世界，卻也是一個透過思考你該做什麼、做你應該做的事情、在你感到恐懼時更謹慎行事的世界。問題是我們現在移除了這個機制，然後搞不清楚接下來該怎麼辦。\n\n- 唯有當你面臨險境並採取正確的方式去處理，你才會成長為一個能夠處理這些事情的成年人。\n\n- 養大了一整個世代沒有暴露在風險之下、沒有能力駕馭這些事情的孩子，在社會層面上是個尤其悲劇的事。跟隱含了一定風險的社會相比，它並不會留下同樣明確的死亡人數、不會留下屍體，但他是一個更糟的結局、更大的平均值——這或許是化約主義的問題：你可以很容易地指出一個不幸死亡的孩子，而要指出幾代人不曉得該如何駕馭自己的情緒、身體、和人生抉擇，就困難得多。\n\n# 色情片\n\n- 讓色情片成為一個特殊類別的，是市場對其內容的影響。當製作色情片的人在市場上相互競爭以獲得更多的關注，他們便會需要突破原先的界線、進以在飽和的市場上脫穎而出。\n\n- 透過色情片來理解自身性偏好及性生活的人，會深深地內化「一切都是以我為中心」的訊息，無論看色情片的人怎麼做都沒辦法改變這點。而當他們找到可能成為他們人生伴侶的人時，他們會缺乏正確的觀念去建立起真正的人際關係。\n\n# 作為人類\n\n- 首先我們必須認識到，進化論所獎賞的「實用性」在某些面向上達到了荒謬的程度，它使我們僅僅專注於那些我們能有效控制的現象範圍，但採用祖先的預設參數，並不適合我們在現代世界中生活。\n  \n- 我們對於「什麼東西很重要」的感覺，往往是建立在一個我們不復存在的世界上。這意味著，如果我們可以修正演化帶給我們的這個僅專注於此時此地的扭曲視角（因為如今那僅適用史前的世界），並思考「我到底是誰」，你會發現自己是個非常古老而重要的東西的臨時保管人，而你的工作是盡你所能地確保這個東西可以在一千年、甚至五千年後繼續存在。這個想法會改變一切、改變所有關於你自己是誰的認知、同時消滅了你的孤獨主義。\n  \n- 一旦你了解到只是某個重要東西的臨時保管人，而假如一切順利，在很久之後、久至任何記得你的人都已經不在之後，這個東西還可以存在——這是一個巨大的責任。這將我們放置在所謂「宇宙笑話」的一個奇怪位置上：我們作為一種生物、生存在複雜混亂的宇宙中，我們一面想要搞懂自己存在的意義是什麼、一面想辦法不要餓死、還得思考如何讓自己的小孩茁壯成長。了解到自己生而為人確實是一件很奇怪的事情，但你可以將這件事情做得更好或做得更糟。我們該思考，自己是否能夠最大限度地善用這個生命，但同時不過度執著於自己在某個時間點之後將不復存在的事實。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Comments/How-Wolves-Change-Rivers":{"title":"","content":"tags:

federal government and that stops anything from becoming too tyrannical in principle ([Time 0:05:25](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c02a07d903800093afdb9))\n- \u003e but here and in canada although less so in canada because we're you know modern and trying to dispense with the monarchy modern confused dim-witted and untraditional um and casual and careless and then we have the french english problem which makes things more complicated on the monarchical front you have four divisions you have executive legislative judicial and symbolic and the monarch holds the symbolic weight and that's really smart because it separates it to some degree from the political weight you know you see what happens in the united states is well first of all is the president tends to turn into this to the czar you know because they have this idea in the united states now like first lady it's like what the hell is that we don't have that in canada nobody knows anything about about justin trudeau's wife and that's been the history of of canadian politicians it's like just because you're justin trudeau's wife doesn't mean you're queen but in the united states it's like well you know hillary clinton maybe she's queen and that's and that's partly because there is that demand for the symbolic weight that the leader should manifest and you also see that to some degree in the united states which is a star worshiping culture obviously with the glitterati and the royalty of hollywood and it's better put there it's better put there in the entertainment section even though that's also somewhat dangerous because it tends to elevate actors into pronouncements of ethical ver pronouncers of ethical virtues say but better there than in the political realm trump he's like king and president all rolled up into one and that's just too much and so and so i really admire the monarchical system and i think that for whatever reason the uk has done a wonderful job of maintaining that and ([Time 0:05:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c02fb0d030d0009c3c528))\n- \u003e i know the economic analysis indicate that the royal family generates way more income than they spend you know because they're a major and everything they're associated with here's a major tourist attraction it's this tradition that you have here this monarchical tradition is something that's tremendously attractive to people who don't have that canadians for example americans and because it's it's just it's so theatrical and so unique and then you had queen elizabeth who man i mean that's quite the woman there what how many 13 prime ministers and so you had someone around to intimidate all your prime ministers that's a really good idea and i'm sure she did a fine job of that you know ([Time 0:07:43](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c03240d030d0009c3c529))\n- \u003e you can imagine how useful it was psychologically in some sense for the prime minister who has monarchical temptations in some sense like trump did to have to go on a regular basis to this remarkable person who'd seen this immense span of political history and confess in some real sense right and to be subject to her cautious and wise judgment because i think she was a woman who was traditional and cautious and wise in the highest degree and there were scandals in her family but like you have a family if people knew what your family was doing don't you think there'd be scandals and so but she was remarkably free of scandals over that entire period and that's that's a hell of a thing to manage for 70 years

to the occasion and your country and the rest of the british commonwealth will recognize that what they have in the shared bonds that unite them based on english common law and the great democratic tradition that's so much a function of this country and this country really in particular i mean you're the birthplace of both canada the us australia new zealand india these amazing countries these free democratic productive generous societies it's quite the accomplishment and i see in england and europe but in england too in great britain such a such apprehension about that such refusal to note the greatness of your country and its contributions i mean you know no one in the united states ever talks about the fact that the uk was the country that er that eradicated slavery like that's that only happened once in the whole history of the of the human race you know when your country did it it took 175 years and a huge economic yeah you know it was it was your country and the great people who were were spearheading that movement at the time that established once and for all on the political and economic front that that was not to be tolerated and then you know it took a while for that idea to spread everywhere it still hasn't because there's there's plenty of slaves in the world the estimate's 30 million at the moment by the way but there are very few people who will come out forthrightly and say that it's that it's right that it's okay that you know might makes right and your country was definitely one of the moral forces in the world the primary moral force on the political front who established once and for all that that was no longer acceptable and so and and and and yet mostly what characterizes a fair bit of self-image in great britain is shame and you know every country has things to be ashamed of but not every country also has things to be proud of

guard and uh and then maybe we'll guard it but to do that we're going to have to defend ourselves against unwarranted accusations of of guilt not that there's not something to be guilty about you know because we're all the beneficiaries of the atrocities of history and we have to atone for that in our personal behavior but by the same token man you're supposed to separate the wheat from the chaff

這個錯覺之所以是錯覺，是因為我們錯以為讓人去念大學可提昇「素質」，但並不會。我們只是讓可以去念大學的門檻變低，讓「素質」比較不好的人也能成為大學生而已。亦即學歷的通膨。\n- 知識經濟並不會讓我們需要更多大學生，只是讓我們重新檢視教育的內容究竟該是什麼，究竟哪些知識和工具是有助於下一代人在知識經濟世界中生存。\n- 21世紀的NBA球員之所以比五十年前的球員更強大、強大到幾乎是不同星球的人類，並不是因為現代人比較會打籃球、或有比較多會打籃球的人，而是因為人類在這項運動上累積的知識和工具讓我們更能夠有效地訓練，讓本來就有天份的人能夠拿出以前人不知道可能的表現。如果說這是現代人比較會打籃球，是個很奇怪的推論。\n- 不幸的是，教育政策的制定者和改革者通常只了解過去，而根本不知道未來會需要的知識和工具是什麼。這往往不是他們的錯，因為預知未來本身就是件不可能的事。\n- 大部分的產業仍然可以被傳統教育所滿足，所以普遍的教育基本上只需要讓大部分的學生具備應該要有的技能和知識，就已經是功德圓滿。不需要太刻意地超前部屬（但當然可以讓部份辦學者去嘗試不同類型的超前部屬、有針對性的教育目的），因為教育界的傳統菁英不大可能對未來需要的東西可以有像樣的認知。\n- 學校需要做的事情，其實主要是提供大家已經更新到最新版的知識和工具，讓在不同聰明才智程度的人可以盡量「跟上」世界當前的狀態。不過就算學校在這部份做得不好，現在也已經有太多工具讓人可以真正地接觸最新的知識和工具。\n- 我們不該以為更多大學生可以幫助我們迎接知識經濟，因為滿街大學生都可佐證他們在學校所學根本沒有幫他們為出社會做準備。恰巧相反，現代人前所未有地發現自己在學校所學根本沒辦法拿到工作上用。\n- 之所以我們還是會追求唸好大學，是因為挑選菁英大學畢業生對大部分企業仍然是個行得通的穩健策略，就算菁英大學中偶爾出現一些較差的案例，只要學歷在大方向上仍然是個夠可靠的指標，民間企業就沒有好理由放棄，於是菁英大學學歷就仍有價值，辦學者就仍會努力讓學校變得更「菁英」（不管上了什麼榜、對學生究竟有沒有幫助），學生於是就會努力擠進菁英大學——一個惡質的多極陷阱，沒有人能夠主動改變這個生態。\n- 只會有部份時代尖端（因此學校教育還沒跟上）、或是本來就無法靠正規教育建立技能的產業，才會主動拋棄學歷、用其他方式評斷一個求職者的能力。但這很難同時大規模地發生於整個社會，除非整個社會在短時間內都發現學歷和素質的落差真的已經差到這個指標只是虛有其表。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Comments/Stephanie-Gray-Pro-Life-Arguments":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Author: [[Pints With Aquinas]]\n- Full Title: Stephanie Gray | The Matt Fradd Show Ep. 9\n- URL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=JQKZsfy_YdM\n---\n\nThe sovereignty of individual is the deepest truth I can currently conceive of and can't reason any deeper. I almost have to take a leap of faith and believe that each one of use is made in the image of God, as it sets the very fundamental for our sovereign existence.\n\nTo be valued both by ourselves and by others, is an undeniable instinct we all share and the basis of how we conduct our lives. We like to live as if we're something of value and we like it when others validate that ideas, and others will find us respectful only when we treat them the same way.\n\nFree will or not, we as humans like to live as if we're conscious agency of our being. We certainly don't like to be devalued as if we're merely objects or means to an end, that's when we'll feel used, taken advantage of, lied to, and betrayed.\n\nAlmost universally, the ideal life we can possibly imagine for ourselves consists of something involving appreciation and care from our family, validation and recognition for our work, cherishment and love from our partners, and affirmation and respect for ourselves. This is the very instinct we live of, and the ideal we live towards.\n\nSo it's undeniable that one of, if not the very thing we want in our life, is to be valued as a human being, in whatever way we individually desire. Being valued as an individual can give us tremendous meaning and help us get through significant amount of hardships, which is why the voluntarily adoption of responsibility is one of the quickest way to cultivate drive and meaning for your life.\n\nThis is why in our daily life, we should not only view ourselves as individuals as values and not accept ourselves to be used (to be enslaved by other's emotions or actions), but should also be wary not to reduce any person's individuality down to his/her look, race, gender, opinion, action, and belief. As tempting as it is to do so, by fighting this lazy and irresponsible attempt to reduce people into less than who they are and dehumanize them, we form a much stronger basis for public discussion, social affair, mutual understanding, genuine and trustful interaction on all levels. This is a moral pillar for a strong and stable society.\n\nSo this leads us to why watching porn is wrong - and I'm mainly talking about the act of watching people have sex for one's own pleasure - is because this act is equivalent to exploiting the performers for one's own usage and reduces them to merely objects for certain means. Watching porn is not wrong because sex and body are sinful, but this the very act we should avoid as it's wrong in and of itself, whether or not the performer likes it or if it's hurting anyone.\n\nAnd so there's no more dangerous idea than what some people might think 'humans as parasites on earth'. Such view might come from the care for the environment as well as the pessimistic view for humanity, but it's nonetheless a catastrophic idea. Such idea is not only not helpful (should we just line people up and shoot them? tell people to quit having children?), but itself degrades the value of the person promoting it, which is why it's catastrophic - it's an idea that can bring demise to the very person withholding it. And that's precisely what many mass shooter did - when one REALLY believes there to be no value in humanity and its existence, the most logical act would be to kill as many people as possible before one commit suicide.\n\nThat leads us to suicide. Imagine the ideal life we talked about where your value is appreciated, now consider the opposite direction, where a person is totally not valued. Despite there're many other complex reasons why people lead to suicidal thoughts,\n\n...The very suicide attempt is the doing (direct result) of the circumstances in which the person is not valued, so the only real self-conscious decision in the midst of it would be to stand up and live as if you're a valuable individual. Do not let the whole self destructing circumstance consume you into nothingness, which is what the darkness of this world can sometimes do to people.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JQKZsfy_YdM\n\nKey foundation that pro-life arguments are based on: Value of a living being (human) is based on the potential (human-ness) that one possesses, not on whether one can express that fully at a given moment.\n\nThe same can be said to those with brain damage (or even brain dead) or seriously ill. People will do what they can to hold on to these loved ones in the hope of them being well again - to realize the potential of being a human in this world again. It seems somewhat illogical or cruel to disregard that part of a embryo just because it hasn’t have the chance to prove its capacity of human-ness and establish a relationship with anyone, yet.\n\nHowever, how do we determine which potential is greater? The mother’s potential without carrying this unwanted child, or the potential of both of them living, or even the potential of the child at the expense of sacrificing the mother’s life if needed? In different period of the human history we seemed to have different answers, and I’m not so sure how to answer this one at this moment, and I’m quite certain this answer is unanswerable.\n\nFor the most part I’d still suppot a society with minimal interference of people‘s live from the government and I do not trust governments for achieving greater goods for most citizens (as I do believe in the sovereignty of individual‘s choices) and I do want to stay away from authoritarian regime of most kinds. I’d still propose a free, libertarianism socieity with minimal interference from the governments but with high moral standards of the people - having the shared sense of responsibility of the people goes hand-in-hand with the optimized freedom.\n## Highlights\n- \u003e On Pro-choice position: \n\t- it comes down to autonomy. we are a culture obsessed with autonomy, obsessed with choice and control. so people in support of abortion would argue that it's about my bodily autonomy, my right to control my body, and therefore if I want to have an abortion which is something that involves my body being laid down on the abortionist table then I should be allowed to access that ([Time 0:13:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8173439485f00095eff85))\n\n- \u003e It's not only the woman's body: \n\t- we know that it is not just the woman's body that's involved when she has an abortion. when a woman takes a pregnancy test and she's not yet seen the results and but she doesn't want to be pregnant, if the test comes negative, will she go to an abortion clinic?  obviously not. But if the test comes up positive and she doesn't want to be pregnant, will she then consider going to the abortion clinic? yes. \n\t- what is it that the positive test is telling her versus what the negative test is telling? the negative test is basically saying: it's just your body, don't worry it's just you, but the moment she has a positive pregnancy test, that's telling her it's no longer just her body, there's another body there, that's why she's thinking about going to the abortion clinic, an action she would never take if she had the negative test. \n\t- so the very fact that she's now going to the abortion clinic is an admission there's another body present so what about that body's bodily autonomy? what about that individuals choice? the choice I could make to lay my body down on the abortionist table is a choice that if I'm pregnant is going to impact another body and if I believe in bodily rights and I need to protect the bodily rights of that pre born human being ([Time 0:15:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8178639485f00095eff86))\n\t- so all of the physiological reactions a woman has when she's pregnant, is because of the presence of another body, therefore if there's another body then how do we treat that other body, how ought we treat that other body, and that's actually an important distinction. it's not what can I do, the question is what **should** I do. I can do almost anything yes, the question is should I do that in a civil society, in a society that believes all humans are equal, in a society that believes in the fundamental human right to life? ([Time 0:17:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b817c739485f00095eff87))\n\n\n- \u003e On the cases of sexual assault:\n\t-  there's two approaches that we need to take: there's the approach of the heart and the approach of the head. we need to start with the former, we need to acknowledge that anyone who's been victimized by sexual assault has been victimized, that they've been traumatized, that is a brutal assault for which there really aren't words to capture how vile it is. while I can't say I've personally experienced it I have observed through friendship the impact that has had on people who have personally experienced that, and I can acknowledge that is a terrible thing, and those people who have been hurt need our support, they need our love, our compassion, and counseling, and so on and so forth. \n\t- the question we then need to ask moving from the heart to the head, so there's an expression of sympathy and then this introduction of logic: will abortion un-raped a rape victim? will it undo the trauma? will it take away the evil that is happening ([Time 0:19:06](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b818075007ba0009a41dba))\n\t- (It won't but you can remove the brutal reminder by not giving birth to the baby) \n\t  so we acknowledge that there's some reminder, but we can't acknowledge that to the point to think that if we took that particular reminder away, that we'd be eliminating all other reminders, that there wouldn't be things there. \n\t- the next point I would make is that I would ask the question is it fair to give the death penalty to the innocent child that's a consequence we don't even give to the rapist in America ([Time 0:20:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8186e39485f00095eff88))\n\t- generally, abortion supporters I find are not supporters of the death penalty, so these are individuals that wouldn't give the death penalty to a rapist, they wouldn't give the death penalty to a murderer. so then we ask if you won't give the death penalty to guilty people, why would you ever consider giving the death penalty to an innocent person? that in the circumstance of rape, the guilty party is not the preborn child, the guilty party is not the woman, the guilty party is the rapist. so we're now talking with the act of abortion about giving a consequence a punishment to the innocent party that we're not even giving to the guilty party, and even if we were giving that to the guilty party, I think we should all agree that no innocent person should ever paid the price of a crime that they themselves have not committed. \n\t  so I would make the point that abortion is not gonna un-rape a rape victim, it is not going to take away the memories that she's been traumatized, and then most fundamentally, a society that supports human rights may not give punishment for a crime that the individual being punished has actually not committed, that they're not guilty of. ([Time 0:21:59](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8189839485f00095eff89))\n\t- if you could have two women in the same country who have both committed crimes, that according to that country's law, are worthy of the death penalty. one woman is pregnant one woman is not, both of them are guilty. if only one of the two under that law is going to be killed because she's not pregnant, that's an admission that within the body of the pregnant woman is an innocent party, and we don't kill innocent people for crimes that they haven't committed. so interestingly, not only is it the existence of a preborn child that saves some mothers from being killed by the death penalty, but the point is it's an acknowledgment that in her body is an innocent party, and so we don't kill innocent people for crimes they haven't committed. ([Time 0:30:22](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81986ddbfc10009dda902))\n\n- \u003e On when life begins (the embryo can't feel argument):\n\t- Peter singer, who is a professor at Princeton University, would argue that a person is someone who's rational, conscious, or self-aware. and so the abortion supporter will say even if biologically you're human - the embryo in the first few weeks of pregnancy, even the fetus in the first trimester and so forth - they will say well that entity is not rational, conscious, or self-aware in that moment. therefore even if it's biologically a human, it is not a person. \n\t- well if our definition of a person, which is what gives you the right to life and what stops me from being able to kill you, is being rational, conscious, or self aware, what about when you're having surgery and you're under anaesthetic in that moment? you're not rational, conscious, or self-aware, if surgery is happening and I look at you and I say can I kill you, you're not going to respond back and say \"no please don't\", because you're under anaesthetic. if you're sleeping and I whisper while you're sleeping \"may I kill you\" you're not gonna say \"no please don't kill me\", because you're not rational, conscious, and self aware at that moment. \n\t- So the reason we still acknowledge you're a person, is because we would say by virtue of being human, you have the inherent capacity built into your human nature, to be rational, conscious, or self-aware, even though you can't currently express that due to your circumstances of sleeping or being under anaesthetic. \n\t- in the same way, by virtue of being human, the embryo or fetus of human parents has within his or her nature, the capacity to be rational, conscious, or self-aware, but cannot currently express that because of her age. when you're sleeping, you can't express it, because of your circumstances, and that can change quickly. in the embryos case, the embryo may not express it because of the embryos age, which will change as the embryo gets older but our right to life ought to be grounded in our existence, not in how old we are.  the embryo cannot act on certain abilities because of the embryos age, yet human rights aren't based on age, they're based on existence as a member of the human family ([Time 0:24:07](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b818e2ddbfc10009dda900))\n\t- (But as a person, I've expressed my capacity to be rational, conscious, and self-aware before, that's not the case for an embryo as it hasn't shown any of that. )\n\t  so the fact that you have experienced being rational conscious and self-aware right now and then you might lose that ability to currently act on that if you're under anesthetic if you're sleeping and then you're going to come out of those situations and act again the fact that you've previously had this experience why does that matter in contrast to the embryo who has not yet had that experience why is that relevant I would ask the abortion supporter to articulate why ([Time 0:26:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81904548ef0000979697f))\n\t- so I would say the point is that, it is wrong to kill a human, not because the human feels pain at the time of killing, not because the human is aware at the time of killing, but because the individual being killed is a human. and so whether the preborn child feels pain or not, is aware or not, can respond or not, isn't relevant. what's relevant is this child is a member of the human family. \n\t- that's why with abortion supporters, I like to use a reference from the United Nations, which is often perceived as being a pro-abortion institution, but if you look at their foundational documents, they are profoundly pro-life. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says: all members of the human family have the right to life. and then they say in article 6: everyone ought to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law. well, who's everyone? well the preamble talks about \"all members of the human family\", so since the preborn child is a member of the human family by virtue of having human parents, than article 6 applies to them as much as it applies to you and me, that by being members of the human family they ought to be recognized as persons everywhere before the law ([Time 0:28:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81957ddbfc10009dda901))\n\n\n- \u003e Answering the \"Violinist Argument\", \n\t- (\"A Defense of Abortion\" is a moral philosophy essay by Judith Jarvis Thomson first published in Philosophy \u0026 Public Affairs in 1971.) \n\t- On the subject of consent (majority of cases)\n\t\t- first of all, there is a difference between the pregnancy in which a woman, in the vast majority of cases, has consented to the act of sex that brought about to the pregnancy, and the minority of cases where it's not. \n\t\t- so in the case of the violinist, you were kidnapped and plugged into this person without your consent. but for the vast majority of circumstances where women are pregnant, they've consented to the act of sex. and since pregnancy is a possible consequence, they have to accept that.\n\t\t- Like if you play baseball with your child in the street, and your son hits the ball and it goes through your neighbor's window, you can't say to your neighbor: I only consent to play baseball but I didn't consent to the ball going through your window, so I'm not going to pay for your window to be fixed. if your neighbor took you to small claims court, he would be able to argue that by virtue of playing baseball in an area where there was glass, there was an inherent risk associated with that of breaking someone's window, and by entering into the game you have to embrace the consequence and therefore pay to fix the window.

If the woman wants to carry through with the pregnancy when the baby's born and then later realizes she needs some financial help, she goes to do paternity tests he finds out he is indeed the biological father, and she says you owe me child support. now imagine if he came back and said \"hey I consented to the sex, but I sure didn't consent to this pregnancy, so I'm not paying for child support.\" if she takes him to court over this matter, the court will rule in her favor that, by virtue of engaging in the act of sex and creating this human being that he has to accept the consequences, which is the existence of a human being who's vulnerable and needy and requires financial provision and therefore he has a duty to pay child support, so if we expect that of the men shouldn't we expect that of the women.

([Time 0:39:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81aaf776a6b0009c7342a))\n\t\t- I think it's to say that we have a duty to help the vulnerable. what makes rape wrong is that you have a vulnerable party who is attacked by a stronger party; what makes abortion wrong, is that you have a vulnerable party that is attacked by a stronger party - that is in no way intended to minimize the gravity or the trauma of a sexual assault, it's to simply make the point that when injustice happens, when terrible things happen, it doesn't give the victims license to do just anything in response. \n\t\t- I would argue that a victim of sexual assault who becomes pregnant doesn't have to raise the child. the question is in a certain window of time, where no one else can care for the child, is there a responsibility to meet the basic needs of the child? \n\t\t- so again, by way of analogy, we could imagine that you're kidnapped alongside a newborn baby. you were knocked out and then you wake up in a cabin which is locked, there's no way of getting out and you're in the middle of nowhere. and you discovered that you're kidnapped with a child who's of no relation to you and in this cabin. interestingly, there is formula, there's water, and there are bottles. in such case, it's not really a great kind of heroic virtue for me to support this child right there. even though you've been a victim of kidnapping, it's \"unfortunately\" also your duty to meet the basic needs of this child, who's incapable of meeting those needs, and who's unrelated to you, just because it's a the right thing to do. Then when you're freed hopefully from this situation, you don't have to go on and raise the child.\n\t\t- now the abortion supporter might then say well then if you have to help the child in the cabin in the woods where you're both kidnapped, shouldn't you have to help the violinist? because you're not related to the child and you're not related to the violinist. so then it comes down to our basic or ordinary needs, versus extraordinary needs - in the case of the violinist needing to be plugged into my body.

So would it be nice of you - the parent - to give one of your kidneys to your child? yes, it would be nice. would it save your child's life? yes. would it kill you knowing that you've got two? no. but then should the law force a pyramid to give their kidney to their child?\n\t\t- So apparently when it comes to organ donation that there isn't a moral obligation to donate ones organs. it can be an act of generosity and the right circumstances, but it's not a moral duty. and so just as a parent should not have a legal duty to give their born child their kidney, a parent in the case of the mother, should not have a legal duty to give her preborn child her uterus.

I'd say the kidney exists in my body, for my body, but the uterus is very different. the uterus exists in my body, every single month getting ready for someone else's body, every single month my uterine lining is thickening in great expectation for the implantation of the next generation. therefore, you could say the uterus is unique from all the other body parts, in that it exists more for my offspring then for me, and they can therefore claim a right to that in contrary to the born child who can't claim a right to get your kidney.

Maureen Kondik, who wrote a paper called \"when does human life begin\". in that paper, she makes an amazing case for life beginning at fertilization.\n\t- she makes the case this way: she says when scientists have a bunch of cells and they want to know are these cells all the same type or are they different, she said scientist two criteria: they look at cell composition, and cell behavior. so in other words what does it make up of, and what does it do. \n\t- and so she said when you look at a sperm cell, what's its composition? the genetic material of the father. when you look at an egg, what's its composition? the genetic material of the mother. so already with sperm and egg we know they're different cells, because of composition.\n\t- she said now let's look at behavior: when a sperm is in existence and alive, it swims to find an egg and fertilize it. that's the behavior of a sperm - seek out an egg and penetrate it an egg. what is the behavior of an egg? it's to sit around and allow for penetration to occur. so by behavior, we can see the sperm cell in the egg cell are different from each other. by composition they're different from each other -\u003e therefore different cells. \n\t- let's look at that criteria in light of the one celled embryo or zygote is that embryo or zygote same thing? the one-celled embryo, is that individual cell different from the sperm and the egg by composition and behavior? yes, here's how we know. \n\t- when you have the embryo even before the chromosomes have intermingled because that takes time, and so at the moment of sperm egg fusion, when you have the sperms head which has gone into the egg you now in that entity have the composition of the mother and the father, the genetic material of both the chromosomes haven't intermingled, but they're all contained in that one cell, so by composition we know we're dealing with something different.\n\t- then let's look at behavior. if you look at one embryo, the moment a sperm has penetrated an egg, and you have the embryo. if another sperm comes along what happens is it allowed to penetrate, no it can't because this zone is created around the embryo that prevents penetration from happening. now if that was the egg cell it would allow penetration, if it was a sperm it would be swimming around. so by virtue of looking at composition and behavior of the embryo, we see it's different from the sperm cell or the egg cell. \n\t- so we know that something substantively new has come into existence that we didn't have prior to sperm egg fusion, and that new thing is the offspring, the next generation of the parents. therefore if we believe parents have responsibility to their children since we have a new child genetically distinct from mum and dad, then we ought to protect that child from that point forward.

I don't have that likelihood of success when I run out of the building with with 20 frozen embryos, because first of all I don't want them to thaw or they're gonna die, but if I'm taking the the canister out of the building, does it need to be plugged into something so are they gonna die in the process of removing? even if I can somehow use a generator - or whatever is needed to keep them in their frozen state, when they're out of the building then what do I have a likely to success? will they be implanted, should they be implanted that's a whole other ethical dilemma? is it ethical to implant embryos in other human beings who are not they're their biological parents? and so part of it could be, beyond the emotional connection, the likelihood of success of actually saving lives. \n\tso once you start to break down the scenario, you realize this isn't a case for abortion. Inability to save is not the same as direct killing, and it's certainly not saying that if I don't save you that you're not equal to the one I saved.

Consciousness creates the brain (and the illusion of the self), not the other way around.\nThe capital C \"Consciousness\" is all there is, that is God, like in Hindu, everything in the universe is an extension of god. \nOur consciousness is essentially God playing hide and seek with itself, pretending we're not IT and not understanding who he is.\nHuman is created in the image of God. \"Image\" means we're a lesser version of whatever God - the Consciousness - is. \nWe lost touch to God in our pursuit of pleasure and knowledge and power, and that's our original sin.\nTo redeem from our sin, we need to know the highest form of human ideal which is Jesus. Only through Jesus can we know God.\nIt means that, by living our lives of fractured consciousness and aiming at the highest ideal of human existence, can we get in touch again with the Self, the Consciousness, God.\nTherefore, aiming to live out the most virtuous version of oneself is the way to transcend from this consciousness to THE Consciousness. \nThe is the truth that Buddhism and Christianity both discovered, just from the opposite angles.\n\n\n---\n\nBuddhism: Impermanence \u0026 No self. Nonduality. Nothing to realize, nothing to hold on to. Self(non-self)-acceptance\n\nChristianity: The original sins, men made in the image of god, atonement for sins and betterment of oneself, faith in god.

It's not passive, it's not reactive, it's a power of itself to live courageously without an ego. There's this real power behind it when you let go of the ego.\n\nBuddha recognizes the original sins/ignorance of people, thus we need to bear the burden of suffering. To stop the suffering, you need to be actively acting out the correct ways of being in order to cease to suffer. This is just like hoe Jesus taught us to act according to god's will so we can transcend from our original sins.\n\nChristianity provides a clear framework with powerful story to show case how an individual needs to carry his own cross and transcend his sins. Buddhism provides the day-to-day methodologies to help us find the God-ness in our hearts through the eightfold path. Christianity focuses more on the stories and the teaching in them, and provide less concrete method/training to the masses for them to practice their mind. Buddhism is less illustrative with their stories but very detailed in the methodologies and practices, but it can be easily overwhelming as there're simply too many classics in Buddhism that provides infinite amount of information for a normal practitioner to

若是著重於描述現狀，那麼「保守是態度、保守派是大雜燴、保守主義只是原則」。反面的敘述可能更好，當有一個人宣稱保守主義「就是這個教條」時，那他應該完全不懂什麼是保守主義。\n  \n- 有些走馬克思路線的方法論，用唯物論的觀點去解析西方保守主義，完全失去了conservertive的原旨原味，變成「看來很好理解但實際上差距甚遠」。\n  只是有信仰，確實是比沒有要容易上手，至少跟自稱無神論，卻對某些科學論理信奉如聖經般的人，要容易理解。\n  現代保守主義的許多價值，跟筆者從小信仰的基督宗教是高度、密切相關，沒有浸淫在基督教的生活中，會很難理解上述這些作品，關於保守主義中強調的內在價值，到底是什麼玩意。一旦ㄖ無法體會，就會感到現代的保守主義者，言必稱上帝是非常基本教義派的行為，但這與實際狀況差異甚遠。\n  \n- 保守主義偏向概念跟原則，意即從內在價值發出，再外顯到行為上，而非反過來。\n  這些內在價值不是只有普世性的一致性，故不能輕易的認為，東方的哲學思想可以代換，把基督教換成儒教也會有一樣的結果。這類粗糙的對比只會有害於理解，讓我們將複雜的人類社會，簡化成一兩個教條的施行，非常不妥。我們可以將某一些概念引用，例如「己所不欲、勿施於人」，在全世界每個文化圈中都有類似的說法，但不能用幾句成語，就認為宗教都一個樣。\n  有熟悉基督教的人去看整套歐美發展的保守主義，絕對是比較駕輕就熟。近年筆者看到批判歐美保守派的台灣人，不管是住在台灣還是移民美國，其批判完全失去重點，不僅僅是誤解的程度，更像是紮稻草人打。更因為對基督教的不熟悉，尤其是對內在價值的不理解，將自己無法體會的價值，輕易批鬥成無科學根據，但批判者自己對科學之理解恐怕遠比批判對象要少。\n  再加上網路時代要找到特殊案例，用來批評既有的價值實在太簡單，導致許多人輕易相信，舊有價值是全盤錯誤，需要接受有現代性、進步性的科學觀點，去打造符合當代的標準。但相對的，在這些新價值中出現行為失序者，批評舊有價值者卻反而會為之辯護，「少數脫序行為，不能責怪整套理論」。\n  之前批評其他理論時不是說「一個受害者都嫌多」，怎麼現在變成「個案不能代表通則」？\n\n# [保有過去美好之物──秩序（1）](https://vocus.cc/article/63185754fd89780001c03833)\n\n- 理解保守主義的精神，首重理解「秩序」這個詞。\n  我們中文圈的人，對於歐美思想中的秩序一詞，在理解上欠缺內在核心的意義，非常容易望文生義，想像秩序只是一種表面規範。\n  秩序卻是保守主義一切的根本，所謂的重視傳統、標榜緩進的改革，道理都是在秩序兩字。\n  \n- 秩序是一種指引，指引我們從這走到那的標準，一條被開拓過的路徑，一條經由無數前人的犧牲跟實驗確保的路徑。因為已經有路徑，故走起來是有規則，在多數人行走的路上，就會出現一套有條理的行走默契。加上中文意義，我們可以延伸解釋，並非先有次序跟規範才有路徑，而是先打通了一條可行之路，自然產生出符合這條道路的交通秩序。\n  \n- 要說服保守派接受某個嶄新的政策，最好的辦法是說服他們，這政策對於既有運作良好的舊規範，不會有太大影響，提出各種論證後，保守派的接受度會提高很多。\n  但反過來說，若每次舉出各種不會影響舊規範的評估，最後卻屢屢證明會影響，那麼保守派的反彈，跟其他思想相比，會異常巨大。他派別擁護者往往不能理解，秩序的維護非常仰賴信用，保守主義者對於信用被破壞的憤怒是非常直接粗暴的。\n  \n- 如果社會是一台機器，那麼秩序就是齒輪，是整個社會系統運作的機制核心，一種協調、和諧的機制，無論是小轉大、大轉小的齒輪，或是單純改變施力方向的齒輪，都是看似不起眼卻是大型機具運作的核心要素之一。\n  作為和諧機制的核心，秩序身為齒輪有多重意義，根據架設的位置，繞行特定的轉動方向而不同。雖然單一齒輪只能做一件事，但很多齒輪能做到更多事。只要機器（社會）依照齒輪的設定去走，定期維護保養，就能長久運用。\n  而齒輪作為秩序的表現，也代表時間久了需要更換，但更換不能把尺寸規格全部替換掉。各位試想，為了換掉一個磨損的齒輪，規格換大了一號，即便新齒輪的材料無比堅固，對整台機器來說也是運作不良的。為了更換新齒輪，打掉整台機器去重造，非常的不切實際。\n  最常見的現象，是局部性的更換，將某處老舊的機械部件，逐漸換成新的，功能可以更強，但要跟原本的主要機械部位有相容性。\n  \n- 秩序就是廣義的法律表現，一種適用社會所有人的規範。法律有地域性，也象徵著秩序並非全部都是超越國界的普遍性原則，在殺人、偷竊等項目上，各國或許有刑責差異，但不會有不處罰的情況。這類普遍原則會存在，也當然有根據民情風俗不同的法律，僅能適用在特定範圍。\n  秩序由下而上成長，所以每個地區都會長出具有「獨特性」的秩序規範，縱然全世界每個文明拿出自己的秩序規範，會有非常多的共通性，諸如殺人偷盜必須受到處罰，但我們不能用都有殺人罪，去認定每個文明的秩序長的都一樣。\n  保守主義認為秩序要由下而上成長才會穩固，不同文明間的接觸，也會相互交流，慢慢融合出有普遍性的規範，成為共通的秩序。但這個流程因為是由下而上，所以傾向我們所謂的「融合」，而融合本身必定有主體，不存在兩個完全對等的文明，使兩種秩序可以平等用1:1去融合出新的。\n  保守主義對於不同秩序的交融，並非是絕對抵制，而是基於常識去判斷，漸進式的調整。\n  \n- 秩序做為由下而上長出的東西，我們不可能只接受其中一個部分，其他的都不要。意思是，保守主義對於接受秩序這件事，是要全盤的去理解，不能只挑好的不要壞的，天底下沒有佔盡好處卻無代價這種事。\n  秩序的衝突需要更多的妥協，妥協不是鄉愿，好比今天台灣接受移民，主體就是台灣。我們可以尊重移民本國的文化，但前提是移民要先能尊重台灣的文化，並同意、理解、接受將以台灣為主體的秩序。這不是文化歧視，而是必然的過程，沒有主體是不可能的，至於移民本人的母國文化，保守主義不認為有絕對的優劣，只有對主體而言，適不適合共存、融合的部分。\n  保守主義不會反對新的移民文化，只是要放長久來看，移民會融入台灣，形成一套新台灣文化，但這必須是長期、緩慢的吸收，不能是激烈的結合。原因後面會提到，秩序的存在對於全體有利，激盪的融合不僅是消耗資源，更可能促成舊秩序的崩解。\n  \n# [保有過去美好之物──秩序（2）](https://vocus.cc/article/6327575ffd8978000195fc56)\n\n- 更具體的說，法律即秩序是非常廣義的講法。\n  在法律之外，有一時一地的人們，共同生活的習慣，以及對大自然、社會、人生的一些信念。在沒有法律規定之外，人們還是會依照習慣處理人與人之間的糾紛，依照信念做為自己行為的準則。不管我們稱這個習慣是風俗、信念是宗教都可以。法律沒有明定的部分，萬一發生糾紛需要處理，司法人員通常會用習慣、社會常識去判斷對錯，最後使其成為一套成文法。\n  相處之道，就算經過幾百年，也不需要變成法律條文。但薪資標準根據時代則會有基本法律保障。我們不能因為法律沒有寫，就認為什麼都可以做，無視一切習慣。法律是張弛有度的彈性體，應當跟時代並進，但不能脫離社會習慣，以及在地社會的整體信念價值落差太大，這只會造成窒礙難行的結果。\n  \n- 多數的標準來自於人類生物本能，演化出來的各種生存需求，經過群體生活的長期演變，慢慢成為當代的標準。這些標準價值，並非由哲人或是大思想家提出才成為準則，而是多數人都認同的標準，被學者整理成有文字記載的經典。這些基於共同習慣，也是每個人的信念，最後有些可以具體化的就成為法律。\n  所以，一個成熟的社會，法律就是秩序的表現，但我們不會說法律就是秩序，仿佛不違法也不會失序一樣。一個法律無法滿足這個社會多數的習慣，合乎信念上的自我要求，這套法律就不會被認真遵守，秩序就無法從內心體現，這樣的社會是極其脆弱的。\n  正義必須透過法律的公正執行才能彰顯，這也是為何保守主義者認為，不能因為某些近年才出現的新價值，就強迫法院修改標準。就算要修改，也應該走正常的立法程序，如果只因為時代變了這種理由，或是強烈的特殊團體抗議，法院就從善如流，不依照法律執行，那麼正義就無法得到落實。\n  \n- 自由也在秩序後才產生，沒有秩序下的自由不是自由，只是失序行為。這意思就是「不影響他人自由下的自由才是自由」，每個人的內在秩序，都可以是自由思考無拘無束，但在社會上的外在秩序，就必須遵守規範，不得任意侵犯他人權利。\n  \n- 我們如果以為秩序就是法律，忽略社會習慣，更將人心信奉的價值，看作後天可以任意修正的項目處理，就可能設立忽略人心的法律。進而損害到法律的權威性，接著摧毀秩序本身的穩固，造成社會崩壞。\n  不管邏輯上的敘述多完美，或是論證的程序多正確，只要這套秩序規範的基礎，並非從下而上長出的多數習慣，那麼推行前都得要再三考慮、小規模施行看看狀況再說。\n  這不管是自己腦中想出的新規定，還是移植他國的法律，保守主義者對秩序的認知，非常強烈的基於「從下而上長出」，就算我們認為這些習慣實在不通現代情理，但畢竟是百年來運作良好的規範。要修正不是不行，取消也並非不可以，而是要謹慎再謹慎。\n  因為由下而上長出，就跟「橘逾淮為枳」一樣。\n  所以，任何根基於法律的秩序，都得要先適用於處在法律範圍內的人們，生活習慣與價值標準皆能接受的範圍。依照這種邏輯去修正、制定的秩序才會長久，不需強迫的法律，人人才有相互提醒跟遵守的意義。\n\n# [保有過去美好之物──秩序（3）](https://vocus.cc/article/632ff4c5fd897800018054cc)\n\n- 所謂的失序，表面的徵兆，初始就是法律的權威被蔑視，人們也不再照著傳統社會習慣做事，人心毫無共同體的信念，走向徹底的利己，只在乎今早，中午以後的事都不管。\n  走到這步之前，社會就會開始大亂，然後大亂的社會無法提供穩定的力量，近一步促使上述的失序行為加速。人與人陷入無止境的相互衝突，因為整個社會做為共同體已經處在無政府狀態，欠缺執行法律的機制，更無強制執行的力量，或說法律已經形同具文，無人遵守。\n  \n- 秩序的消費者是每個人，大家都在消費秩序帶來的好處，不時的產生壞處，透過秩序的運作消化這些破壞秩序者（司法）。我們可以理解，透過司法程序，以及人情義理中的懲惡揚善，將動搖秩序的個人處分，如同生態系中的分解者，將這些負面行為轉成養分，回歸大自然。\n  從此觀點，秩序的生產者就非常明顯，是屬於內在的價值，這個價值可以來自於宗教，也可以是其他超自然力量的信仰，或是個人對於這個世界的體悟，屬於信念的部分。每當社會出現失序行為，透過我們相信的體制加以處置，處置的過程就如同分解罪惡，使其成為養分，加強我們對於現有價值體系的信任。\n  每個人的信念堅定，伴隨經驗而生的習慣，加上值得信賴的法律與執行者，秩序就得以成立。\n  \n- 失序的瞬間崩毀，來自於多數想要維持秩序的個人，在某個時間點上，信念崩潰了。或者說，由這個信念產生的習慣崩潰，個人或許還是相信著一些理念，但對於怎樣執行完成不再有期待。\n  失序是很恐怖的，整個社會處在無法運作下，對人類整體的破壞顯而易見。沒有穩定的秩序，讓人們可以依規範過日子，就無法累積資源、發展各種生產性技術，沒有技術的進步，衝突多年後，生活水準依舊提升不了，只留下滿地破壞的殘蹟。\n  \n- 沒有穩定的秩序，就累積不了各種資源，資源總量不足，要追求更卓越的進步就是緣木求魚。\n  「倉廩實而知禮節，衣食足而知榮辱。」\n  在保守主義上的體現，就是根據當下的資源量跟技術能力，選擇符合可以施行的秩序，而這個秩序最好是從下而上，隨著社會成長而茁壯，如此才會穩固。\n  \n- 失序絕對不是重建秩序必要的代價，失序往往是全體付出犧牲，而少數主導新秩序者獲得絕大的利益。保守主義在乎的，並不是原教旨主義，那種在乎宗教情懷超乎一切，而更接近於「對多數人是否有利」、「放長遠來說對社會整體是否有利」，如果秩序的修正可以帶來更長遠的整體利益，那麼修正就是必要的，只是這個時間、變化幅度、影響範圍，必須審慎的評估，謹慎的推行。\n  審慎、謹慎，不代表不想動，很少有事情是「不做馬上就完蛋」，就個人來說可能如此，整個社會很難發生。所以遇到特例，救濟措施應優於修法改正，而非嘶吼立刻修法，救濟當事者就放著不管。\n  \n- 失序的根本，是內心價值的崩壞，一個信念崩毀的社會，其上的法律都只會是具文。而要維持這種社會的運作，除了提高極大的統治成本，用嚴刑峻罰去逼迫人民遵守外，別無他法。\n  歷史上所有的失序後的新秩序，幾乎都以專制獨裁作結。而提倡新秩序者，多半建立不了人心，於是為了理想國，只好使用利益組建武力，動用暴力迫使一般人遵從。\n  歷代用理論去倡議新秩序者，毫不意外的認為，這些失敗者是因為失去理念，才導致新秩序建立不起來，並不是這套建立新秩序的理論有錯。但實際上？是先失去人心，創造不了由下而上的新秩序，只好透過背離理想的手段強制執行，其結果正好就證明這套新秩序理論是錯的，不具有執行可能。\n  保守主義者為何對提倡美好理想者，往往先保持健康的懷疑態度，這並非對提倡者的人格鄙視，更不是輕蔑其對理想的堅持。只是單純的因為結果論，歷史上越是理想化的人，就越容易為了目標去歪曲手段。\n\n# [保有過去美好之物──秩序（4）](https://vocus.cc/article/6337f704fd897800017c7e2c)\n\n- 秩序與意識形態的差異：一條指引方向的路徑，通常是「已經存在」的，而意識形態通常只是告訴我們目標跟方向，並沒有具體的道路指引。\n  意識形態沒有生產力，是沒有根的東西，不同意識形態更接近於資源的使用方式不同。相信大政府的意識形態，認為資源交給中央處理比較有效率；覺得小政府才不會干預發展的，則是把資源分發給各個人民，任其自由發揮。\n  \n- 一個處在失序狀態，毫無秩序性的社會，意識形態的方向指示是沒有參考座標的。這種在失序中，盲目依循特定意識形態卻成功，並不是意識形態的理論優越。這比較像是在荒地中，領導者堅定帶領大家往某個方向走，靠著眾人硬踩出一條道路。而創建新路上的風風雨雨，反過來促成意識形態內的論述完整，從而打造出新的秩序。\n  我們不能說意識形態具有生產力，道理等同你無法宣稱，派遣一千個人踩出一條路，是標準的工程作法。\n  而實際上，這類意識形態沒有生存能力，人類社會很少是遺世獨立，尤其是近千年的世界，每個社會周邊都有其他社會。一旦一個地區失序，整個社會處在崩毀狀態，不可能等某個沒有實驗過的意識形態，慢慢摸著石頭過河，更大的可能是，外在既有秩序被複製於這塊失序的土地上。\n  \n- 在失序的年代，提出有效的意識形態，就需要含有新的秩序指引；在有序的年代，一個有用的意識形態，就得要有現今秩序的替代方案。\n  意識形態不能替代秩序，而是要提出秩序的替代物，一個好的意識形態，其中必定有指引秩序的道路。任何沒有辦法提出，或是只有極為概略性敘述的意識形態，卻宣稱自己可以制定法律標準，全部都是騙人的。\n  \n- 失序帶來的混亂，將是資源的虛耗，與技術的停滯，最終對人類社會造成負面影響。\n  在一段時間內，都不會被消耗殆盡。畢竟多數人都還想要維持社會的運作，並不是大家都想掠奪，人是可以用腳投票的，而在沒有更好的環境可選擇下，人類會傾向繼續努力維持社會不崩潰。\n  只是，這種走向失序的社會，不會帶來秩序的好處，意即累積。人類的科技是歷年無數智慧的累積，所有今天看到的一切，也都是過去的人們經驗的總承。\n  \n- 「審慎評估」是保守主義的主要態度。並不是要求守舊不變，而是既有的路徑走得很順，那沒有道理無緣無故改掉，除非有替代路線，或是找到更好的道路。\n  保守主義的秩序觀，非常在意連帶影響的社會資源，用生物的角度來說，就是更在乎生態系統，而非一條單一的食物鏈。\n\n# [自律負責，而後自由──共同體（1）](https://vocus.cc/article/63418653fd89780001a1dc0a)\n\n- 共同體的成立，必須要先有一個秩序，秩序是「有意識」的去遵循，不管我們稱這個秩序是什麼，若沒有秩序，共同體就不會存在。\n  秩序的具體表現是法律，基礎是社會習慣與個人信念，通常我們會認為，這種多數人對某些行為的看法，一般行事的做風，是一種習慣、習俗，而多數人的信念總集，我們廣泛的稱之為道德。\n  道德為何是個人信念的總集，因為每個人的信念或多或少都有差異，但在一個共同體內不會落差太大，總會有一個交集在。這個交集形成多數共識，有的人會擴張解釋，有的則傾向緊縮，但怎樣都會在交集範圍附近，標準不會差太遠。\n  就以基礎來看，習慣跟信念組成一個個人認同的秩序觀，但就整個共同體來說，是由「道德」作為最核心的概念，而從這個道德感、觀點出發，形成一個普遍的行為標準，也就是社會習慣，習慣中有需要的最後成為法律。\n  認同並發自內心遵循法律，前提是認可這個道德準則，若沒有內在的認同，法律就會不停的被衝撞。\n  在一個運作良好的共同體秩序中，是由內而外建立習慣法，而法律的變化，從外而內影響回習慣與道德的標準。\n  \n- 保守主義對於維持基於秩序的共同體運作，有很高的優先順序。存在即有一定合理性，或許不合時代，不容於其他國家，但至少在這裡行得通，也沒什麼人受到損害，那麼就不能只因為少數人覺得不合理，就得強迫所有人接受據說他國更為優越的法律。\n  \n- 就「單純」維持秩序的角度而言，可運作性比對錯重要，惡法亦法，只要冤案不要太過分的情況下，寧可用事後救濟的辦法，也不能不執行法律。注意「單純」這兩個字，實際上世界根本就不單純，只要一個共同體，有跟外界接觸，就會有交流，共同體秩序就會產生對比。保守主義的秩序觀點，秩序本身是為了使生活更加優渥，提高技術優勢，增進全體福利而生，如果對比其他的共同體秩序，有更好的地方，當然可以學。\n  這種因接觸產生的秩序對比，需不需要引進，在實務上的運作，保守主義會很重視平衡，以不影響舊有秩序的穩定下，去做出適當修正。\n  \n# [自律負責，而後自由──共同體（2）](https://vocus.cc/article/634dae9ffd8978000137ec63)\n\n- 道德觀點從何而來，多半由人類的原始狀態，也就是最初的世界觀——超自然力量。\n  人類的思想在個體上會有很大差異，但以群體間的尺度看卻不會。原始狀態，每一個共同體的思想落差很小，基本上都要有秩序引導，而秩序往往跟所生長的環境有關。在嚴苛的環境，大自然就像是不停的在試煉人類，諸神也相對狂暴；在富饒的自然環境中，神明則多有寵小孩的一面，將萬物賜予他最愛的人類。\n  在看天吃飯的年代，信仰的力量非常重要，基於信仰產生的秩序，有很強烈的宗教性質，毫不奇怪。\n  不存在秩序完全真空狀態，人們一定要有一個秩序，不然沒有共同體的個人很難存活。個體或許可以求生，但也僅僅是苟活，想要提升生活水準，就得要群體生活，群體必須先服膺某個秩序，不管是自造或是複製還是加入。\n  秩序生成，必定有先來後到，子女是父母生的，生物有自然生老病死，沒人從石頭中蹦出來。前面提到初始狀態，也是有一些最早的人，發展出簡單宗教，基本薩滿信仰，而後相信這套的人群，慢慢修正、補正這些神話，成為一套完整宗教體系。\n  \n- 就客觀上的表現而言，有神跟無神論，不是都一樣，只要有分配的意識形態就好，何必在乎建立秩序時，那股內在的道德力量？這種思維很唯物，把人的心靈貶低為物質影響的結果，只不過在現代，唯物論不受人喜愛，很少有人會主動宣稱自己一切唯物，多半採用不停否定非唯物的說法，或是反覆呢喃「我們有自我選擇」，規避共同體秩序中，從古至今都存在的道德力量。\n  \n- 秩序與意識形態的差異：意識形態只是抽象的指引，秩序則是已在社會具體運行。沒有以信仰為基礎的意識形態，遲早都會走向信仰化，或稱意識形態宗教化。\n  有神論跟無神論在秩序上的看法，最大差異體現在外，應該就會是對於信仰、意識形態有差異。有神論者的信仰與意識形態可以分開，只是通常發自信仰的意識形態會有很多地方與信仰雷同；無神論者則是把信仰跟意識形態兩者混為一談，但否定這是信仰，行為卻如信徒，產生矛盾。\n  \n- 今天根據無神論產生的制度，都有嚴重問題，其中最大缺點，當屬「不守信」，畢竟道德若不是出自於敬畏，而來自對於物質的追求，那麼為了物質利益去背信也很合理。\n  若沒有精神上自我約束，守約定的社會習慣根本建立不起來。沒這種習慣養成，法律訂再嚴格，鑽漏洞的人也會很多，最終得投注更多資源在防範背信的行為，或者乾脆當沒看到，放任法律權威受損。例如一些開發中國家的交通法規，其實很嚴格，但誰去遵守？\n  這就是保守主義認為無神論、唯物論等，只會讓社會運作成本拉得極高，輕視內心道德的建立，反而阻礙了應該自然形成的社會習慣。\n  保守主義認為無神論有害的理由，並不是單純「信仰問題」，而是「沒有信仰」的問題。人類所有運作千百年，至今仍然良好的共同體秩序，都需要信仰為基礎，一但我們把秩序的根基，習慣與道德抽離其內在力量，代之以物質基礎，秩序就不再成立。\n  而這些無神論與其發展出的意識形態，要成為一個共同體的秩序，勢必走到意識形態宗教化一途，領導者必須神化，不然秩序無法成立。沒有超越自然強大的敬畏對象，那麼共同體內每個人都不需要服誰了。\n  \n- 為何內在力量的欠缺，不僅僅是意識形態差異，會連秩序都形成不了，讓共同體無比脆弱？\n  以保守主義的觀點去淺白的說，那是因為「標準太低」，所以秩序形成的階級，非常容易形成極端強烈的精英意識，也就是上層會發自內心的瞧不起下層，而下層一旦爬上上層，就會同樣開始瞧不起原本的下層，整個共同體的內部無法穩固，一直處在暴亂階段。\n  這種暴亂共同體，不可能有累積，所以除了對外擴張外，沒有更有效的利用資源辦法。\n  \n- 簡單說，基於宗教信仰慢慢長出的秩序，會有一個非常強大、高遠的敬畏對象。在這種敬畏對象太高的信仰下，無論階級中處在上層下層，都知道自己的存在相比之下微不足道。\n  抱持此種觀點者，才會真正認知到「平等」的意義，非建立在制度上，而是發自內心的理解。由這種發自內心而成的平等觀，會產生「不干擾吾等下的自由」，也就是不侵害他人的自由為自由，不會想用法律去制定道德（因為道德觀趨近神授）。\n  這會引導出集體決策，沒人覺得自己可以代言神，法律只是世俗的一些約定，一般生活行為，遵守著神的律法，也就是我們所認知的有信仰的生活。就以美國來說，擁槍權的存在是為了防止政府對人民的權利侵害，所以人民自己要保有反抗的權力，其本質不是外在，是一種內心的保護，多數人在槍口下是沒有勇氣的，但若人人手上皆有反抗暴政的武器，那麼就能強化抵抗暴政的勇氣。\n  \n# [自律負責，而後自由──共同體（3）](https://vocus.cc/article/63553548fd897800013b6e0e)\n\n- 世界各地的宗教，只要發展的夠久，不管是一神教的猶太、基督、伊斯蘭，或是台灣的民俗信仰，數千年的演變，上層的統治者地位一直在下降，從神的代言人到政教分離後，宗教組織才是代言人，國王只是凡間的代理。然後國王變成跟平民沒有兩樣，只有身分地位之差，沒有能力的絕對差異。最後走到現在，國王只是個國家象徵，身分地位也只有法律上的意義，沒哪個統治者會宣稱自己具有神格，超越老百姓。\n  \n- 基於信仰而生的秩序，秩序本身會對人有強大的限制，因為「跟神比你算哪根蔥」。當這個階級比較的最高處，在人世無法企及的無限位置，那麼不管處在哪一階層，相較之下也都差不多。從這種信仰中，才會孕育出現代民主思想。\n  但無神論的秩序觀，消滅了超自然力量的延續，不認為有所謂值得敬畏的標準。既然沒有最高的，那麼只有更高，每個人都會追求爬到更高的位置。\n  你比較的對象是無限，那麼塵世中的一切比較都很虛無。從這種信仰中誕生的秩序，每個人都會有很強的自我約束力，負面的意思就是「比較認命」，這也是為何無神論者認為宗教是鴉片，欺騙人去認命而不追求自己利益的騙術。\n  確實就個體來說可能如此，但就整體而言，共同體的秩序本就需要每個人，在某個程度上「各盡其能、各取所需」。穩定的本身就需要接受現狀，不肯接受現狀的就會衝撞，當然共同體就無法穩定。然而很殘酷的現實，不穩定的共同體，只會出現有今日沒明天的生活，不可能有創造力，資源累積不了，現代社會無法出現。\n  \n- 現代社會就是工業社會，大量資源的累積、技術的累積、信用的累積，樣樣都是人類智慧的累積。沒有累積，怎有投資創造新技術的餘裕，沒有夠多可接受失敗的資源，共同體不會同意科學基礎，即實驗與試行錯誤。\n  秩序必定產生階級，無神論的階級沒有上限的存在，也不認為有無上的敬畏對象，內在衝突非常劇烈，為了要維持上下的優勢關係，其共同體運作的模式，會更接近掠奪型，不管是對外掠奪，還是上層掠奪下層。\n  從信仰中誕生的秩序，會有相當多的人，是以榮耀神為目的而生，不以自己當下的快樂為追逐目標。或許你覺得這實在很蠢，為了不知道哪來的神明，犧牲奉獻一輩子，該享樂的都沒享到。但就人類這種生物來說，群體性上有部分的人做出犧牲，為了提升技術無私的奉獻，整體就是有益，此類為了下一代幸福努力的信仰，就會讓共同體的適應性更強。\n  \n- 對人性惡的抑制，是基於對秩序的追求，試想誰願意在暴力中成為弱者，誰又願意讓自私的人來管理你？若為了個體的放縱，我們解放了宗教中對於罪的概念，將道德上的罪去除，代換以法律上的罪，那麼失去內在制約的力量，社會只會出現更多自私自利、為所欲為的人。\n  自私自利者，通常都把自己想要的東西，包裝成公眾利益，或是刻意放大少數個案的際遇。說詞都很美好，常以「一個人都不能被壓迫」為由，但每當自己壓迫別人，就改口「制度在壓迫，我沒有」。而自私的人發展出的理論，往往以解放他人的道德束縛為理由，作為他自己不需遵守既有道德約束的藉口。\n  \n- 享樂主義跟自私自利實在太難聽了，進入21世紀後，基於自利論點的利己者，也無法用無神論與衍伸的意識形態辯護，故現在的模式，無神論者開始轉化方法，走向現代秩序要用科學替代這條路。\n  \n- 保守主義認為，現代科學進展太快，而要用科學取代以信仰建立的傳統秩序，理論上可以，實務上做不到。因為科學本來就不是多數人可以理解的，以歷史發展來看，宗教是一種原始的科學，用來解釋大自然現象的方法，每個人都需要一套可以理解自己身處宇宙中，其所運作的秩序，用科學當作門檻實在太高。\n  這更可能形成新的祭司階級，科學家就是祭司，科學家代表宇宙說話，反正一般人不懂科學，所以科學家說怎樣就該怎樣，反科學都該被燒死。當我們整個社會對於科學的理解不夠深，取代的意義就不大，反而容易造成混亂。\n  \n- 進展太快的科學，將之用做秩序的根基，會讓秩序非常混亂。\n  而我們看到的現象，是科學被宗教化，太多想當祭司的人，以及試圖將之宗教化後，可以從中獲取利益者，會把這些科學發現，拿去建立新的道德高地，呼籲大家遵守之。\n  單單就科學發現，然後我們將之變成一個需要追求的目標，並沒有錯。錯就錯在宗教化，把一個指標看成不做到就完蛋，一點都不科學。正確的科學態度，都需要不斷的評估，而現在的科學，在執行上已經出現許多不容質疑的聲音。\n  保守主義反對的是科學宗教化，不是科學本身。要用科學去取代宗教，出現的恐怕不是科學，而是新的科學教，而且更加不寬容。\n  \n- 混沌不會帶來技術的累積，以科學為名建立的新秩序，因為無法替代信仰，只會讓舊有的失序，失序會讓科學失去發展的土壤，讓人回到蒙昧無知，而此時因為舊有的宗教信仰已經被摧毀，想要重建都很難。\n  科學無神論者，是打從心底不相信現代秩序之建立，其根基跟信仰有關，而這類人通常都非常唯物論，不相信內在精神的力量，所以對於摧毀信仰沒有任何遲疑。\n  \n# [自律負責，而後自由──共同體（4）](https://vocus.cc/article/63613559fd8978000178733a)\n\n- 原始宗教的產生，皆會承認人自身的不完美，就因為不完美，人才有努力完善自己品德的重要。\n  數千年人類宗教，所發展出的信仰核心，早就以「普遍善行原則」留下，成為每個社會運作基礎，即使宗教消失了，「普世善」也不會消失。但普世善是以原初的信仰為基礎，轉化成道德後延續，若敲掉信仰以其他替代，這個替代方案經得起考驗嗎？會不會連同我們現在普世接受的普世善都打掉了？\n  這是既有的路徑，保守主義認為這條路徑是行得通，且具有可運作性，那麼就沒有必要刻意去替代這整個秩序的根基，尤其是想從上而下，整個替代掉內在力量的道德成分。\n  缺乏敬畏「超越一切存在」的心態，會創造出無底限的階級，上層自己就是神，對下層無惡不作也沒心理負擔，這將會回到原始宗教創造時，祭司自己就是神的時代。階級衝突將會極為劇烈，社會無法穩定，就沒有累積，失序加速此過程，最後連科學發展需要的資源基礎都不復存在。\n  \n- 激烈改變，很有可能，也實際在發生，讓原有道德秩序的信奉者，完全無法接受，產生了原教旨主義、極端的基本教義派。他們會連接受緩慢的融合都不願意，反對到底，並願意用暴力手段來抵抗改變。\n  保守主義不反對融合新的秩序，反對的是整個替代、快速替代，理由之前提過，由下而上長出的秩序穩固，但一定每個地方都會不一樣。不一樣就不可能無縫接軌的直接套用，必定有衝突之處，衝突就需要透過協調，一點一滴的找出妥協點，最後得出全新的共識。若無法妥協，就讓時間去慢慢培養可以接受兩方的下一代。\n  若強制融合，且讓新秩序的人去主導原有秩序，那麼會出現反動派，讓整體的資源變少，且兩者不停衝突，讓所有人都產生損失。況且，這種硬去主導的新秩序，會因為屬於少數派，為了主導舊秩序的群體，很容易採用更專制的手段，壓制其他人的聲音，遂讓原本應該不錯的新秩序，不僅得不到融合後成果，反倒先變質。\n  \n- 一般稱之為政教分離的原則，不是政治跟宗教分離，是政府與教會分離。\n  由於法律來源之一的道德，與宗教信仰有極大的關聯，遂使得處在一神教範圍的統治者，想要制定法律時，亦不能超出教義的範圍，建築在信仰之上的習慣法，變成了統治者無法擅動的部分。就算更換了政府，換了王家，只要人民對於信仰本身沒有變動，整套基於信仰的習慣法就不大會改變。\n  在權力上比大，但信仰上比誰謙卑的做法，很少有人注意到，這微小但有意義的改變，去除了人的神性，人民也不需要把人當做神服從，將統治者的抽象意義抽離。而無神論等用意識形態作為指引，反倒容易模糊化人與神的界限，統治者無所不為，沒有基於信仰的習慣法限制，內在心靈也無任何道德負擔可言，反而都成為暴政。\n  \n- 從一神教衍生出的路徑指引，秩序具有內在倫理性質，建構出的共同體秩序相當穩固。而世界上一神教的三大宗教，都有原罪的概念，一定程度的傾向人性本惡，必須要有世俗的法律壓制，同時靈魂上要給予道德指引。\n  這些常識在教義上也許說的落落長，但實踐起來很單純，大體上一神教或是其他多神教體系，可以歸納出一些普世性的概念。\n  1. 人與人的相處之道，在於守信、重諾，彼此要有契約精神。\n  2. 法律作為約束性質，而非指引用途，沒有約束的部分，要靠個人品格去補足。\n- 這些規範很像是契約，你對我好、我也會對你好，不需要刻意講，社會上要運作順暢，這種「互相」的作為，在每個共同體文化中都存在。\n  意即秩序的建立，是以內生出的道德性為主體，人性本惡需要約束的在外，形成一套可運作性高的法律，才會穩定、長久。\n  保守主義對於信仰跟秩序的觀點，可以說核心就是內在的敬畏，限制了我們人性中的惡，維護了共同體穩定。\n\n# [人類是用感官去了解世界──理性（1）](https://vocus.cc/article/634bb1f4fd897800011eaf00)\n\n- 我們可以記錄給予小孩多少零用錢，但無法數字化父母對小孩的愛，一知半解的理性主義者會將愛這種情感，用大量的數字去掩蓋，試圖用統計解釋個人。問題在於，統計數字可以表達一個現象，但沒辦法將每個人的情感都表現出來，若只是單純的描述都不會有問題，問題在於過度相信理性力量的人，也容易相信自己可以透過理性去規劃別人的生活。\n  這其實是很有趣的現象，就算再怎樣自認理性者，也曉得可以規劃都市，計畫蓋多少國民住宅，但管不到居民在家裡做什麼。而這類理性過頭者，卻會認為自己的計畫可以完美無缺，涵蓋所有生活面向。這也是啟蒙時代以降思想家，諸如霍布斯、洛克、盧梭、休謨等等，進行許多思想上的實驗，討論理性的社會，但最終真正可運作，將工業社會與傳統信仰結合，創造新世代強健秩序的，是美國基於基督教的社會，法國則走向大革命的火焰。\n  這不是說理性錯誤，而是錯估理性的極限，也不是在吹捧宗教，而是能夠永遠理性行事的人終究是少數，多數人是依靠直覺跟經驗辦事。\n  \n- 美國獨立的過程，根本就是在維護既有的權利，而非打倒腐敗的體制。\n  美國並非為了打倒王權，而是本來就沒有多少王權介入，是英國想要開始提高限制，新大陸居民擔憂「開啟第一步後沒完沒了」，於是加以反抗，最終引發了維護既有自由的戰爭。\n  獨立後的美國，沒有走向法國大革命後的道路，很大一部分就是因為美國初期，根本就沒有太多的知識分子，多到可以高談抽象式的理性治理。\n  \n- 美國國父們是農莊主、商人、小製造業者，沒有一個是雲上之人，全是親手經營產業的實業家。跟隨他們的殖民者，知識水準以當代的歐洲標準來看近乎粗鄙無知。也就是這種無知，讓美國建國初期，對於抽象的法律很反感，對未經試驗過的政策都感到懷疑。不管怎麼說，重視實用、尊重教會傳統才是主流，再加上新大陸的發展處處是危機，在沒有火車跟飛機的年代，一個中央統管的政策非常沒有效率，尤其是在各州的農莊城鎮中，有太多在地發展出的臨機應變。\n  就他們的生活體驗，賦予人民對付野生動物的擁槍權，以及面對有敵意的印地安人自組地方民兵，與其他生活息息相關的法律政策，非常理性有道理。\n  \n- 純粹的理性很容易誕生出激進主義者，因為純理性者會認為，自己可以透過思考得到真理，但現實層面來說，能夠不在乎麵包，生活無虞去思考真理的人，都脫離底層生活太遙遠。欠缺五感的刺激，無法理解基層生活，就會把田園牧歌的圖畫當真，裡頭的蚊蟲跟農村「香水味」都不存在。\n  真正的科學家反倒不易如此，因為科學實驗需要反覆驗證，而社會無法在框架內反覆試驗，故科學家多會對激進改革小心翼翼。\n  \n- 所以在共同體中的理性，要能成之為秩序，比較像是理性作為對物質力量的駕馭，諸如數字分析、政策評估，另外還需要靈性上的堅定意志，合起來成為當代的信仰。如果物質是交通工具，那精神則是指引目標，兩者顯然不能缺其一。\n  \n- 不是最佳化，是最適化，保守主義不認為有可靠理性最佳化的社會，而應該是照著自然發展，找出最適合的秩序。\n  \n- 我們現在稱為「普世價值」的普世善，諸如對生命權的尊重，以及懲惡揚善的基本觀，就保守主義的觀點，普世善皆從古老運作的經驗而來。從來就沒有啟蒙時代後，先用理性去剷除宗教愚昧，而後才有普世善出現這回事。以理性之名推動社會改革者，大多是當代的無神論，以科學為名想要除魅，結果是讓自己的「理性至上」魅化。\n\n# [完美即為不完美──除了神以外，別無永恆（1）](https://vocus.cc/article/63c6f996fd8978000157e644)\n\n- 完美即為不完美──除了神以外，別無永恆\n  這不是宗教警語，只是保守主義的基本精神，讓我們敬畏這個宇宙，承認人類的不完美，將標尺放在無法企及之處，作為信仰的指標。\n  若像筆者有接觸過較正規的信仰道理課程，從小開始接觸聖經者，比較有機會碰觸到信仰核心，這個核心並非教條，而是敬畏。出自內心的敬畏才有價值，而信仰本質是一種永遠的追尋，正因為人類是不完美的，才有努力完善的空間，就因為目標如此遙遠，我們才有持之以恆的理由。\n  \n# [完美即為不完美──除了神以外，別無永恆（2）](https://vocus.cc/article/63ca2d05fd89780001c48c88)\n- 信仰作為秩序的根基，是不可能從社會裡面去除的，信仰的內容會隨時代調整，很慢但不會不動。今天以為改革就得是立刻馬上，信仰擋在前面就是落後守舊，欲除之而後快，就跟倒掉洗澡水時連嬰兒也倒掉的概念一樣。絕大部分人的生活都需要一種信仰，不管信的是什麼，若沒有敬畏之心，就會對破壞社會秩序毫無心理負擔。\n  知識分子或許可以拋棄的毫無負擔，但對一般人來說，沒有信仰跟至高無上力量主宰的宇宙，太過魔幻到無法理解。\n  這種刻意去除信仰，還強迫別人不要去相信，只會讓社會更不穩定，帶來的是破壞而非建設，無法累積資源的社會，哪來能量去創造更好的未來。\n  進步派的各種要求，比較接近於燃燒他人照亮自己，將自己的權益看作比天地都大，至於別人的權益受損，那都是他擋在進步之路前的錯。\n  保守主義者很清楚，這種態度不是進步，只是自私自利。\n  幾乎可以說是美化享樂主義，用以奪權的變種。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Conservatism/%E9%A1%98%E6%99%AF%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%9D%E7%AA%81":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nRef: [A Conflict of Visions](https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Visions-Ideological-Political-Struggles/dp/0465002056)\n\n---\n湯瑪斯·索維爾在《[A Conflict of Visions](https://www.amazon.com/Conflict-Visions-Ideological-Political-Struggles/dp/0465002056)》直指兩種截然不同的、看待人類社會的根本觀點：「有限觀 (Constraind Vision)」與「無限觀 (Unconstraind Vision)」。這兩種觀點顯示了人們在意識形態、政經議題上的關鍵分歧，是源自對人性基本假設的根本差異。\n\n「有限觀」認為人類有著難以改變的自私天性，所以我們應該嚴謹地遵循受到時間考驗的傳統及證據，尋求系統性（而非破壞性）的社會進步。在「有限觀」的世界裡，設計並維持一套能讓每個自私的機構和個人相互制衡的社會制度（諸如權力分立制度、自由市場），遠比崇拜權威、盲從個人經驗、或期待所有人都能拋棄自私天性還要可靠得多，更別說要我們相信政府真的具備必要的德性與才能去管理擴及整個國家的許多龐雜事務。\n\n相對地，索維爾認為秉持「無限觀」的人經常執迷於「人性本善」的理念，所以不願意信任權力分立、去中心化的繁冗過程，也對限制人類行動的大型機構和系統性過程感到不耐煩。他們更傾向於相信問題有更理想、更大刀闊斧的解決方案，而不願接受由社會上每個個人依據自身條件去選擇、權衡、妥協的自然結果。在政治上，他們相信少數夠有遠見的人有能力和資格為社會大眾做決策，由中央當局實施的改革去塑造一個更好的社會、並決定傳統和過時思想的存廢。\n\n顯而易見地，「有限觀」對人性是悲觀的，因此更相信系統性、去中心化、一步一腳印的集體進程，也尊敬引領人類走到今天的文化根基；「無限觀」則以理想主義看待人性，所以相信具有遠見和道德高度的人有資格引領並改變世界，更有責任剷除文化或體制中的敗壞陳腐。\n\n「有限觀」代表了秩序，他提供人們穩定、安全感、社會運作的默契、以及生命的已知藍圖；「無限觀」代表了混沌，他帶來機會、創新、改革、自由解放、以及生命的更多可能。秩序的僵化會導致壓迫、盲從，剝奪人的自由、安康、創造力，混沌的失控則會導致暴力、混亂，使社會喪失和睦、默契、向心力。\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Conservatism/Eugenics-Flawed-Thinking-Behind-Pushed-Science-Alex-Story":{"title":"","content":"tags:

necessarily think that every child that you encounter on the street is special and then you might say well are you blind about your child or are you blind to every other child and I would say it's the second that's true is that you can actually see your children but you don't have enough mental energy or maybe enough breadth of character to see all other children and so maybe I've thought too that love in some sense is the grace of God you know is that if if you're in a relationship with someone that's characterized by love you see each other in some deep sense and you can't see other people like that because you don't have the ability but it's not like the love is a delusion it's the opposite of it

isn't any better thing you can do and so then to minimize that to call it some sort of biological or biochemical aberration which is the worst form of unconscionable reductionism is to reduce the highest possible goal to something that it's nothing but like a trivial consequence and some underlying materiality it's appalling and it's really demoralizing

because he's the leading member of the British Eugenics Society, then Marx is important because he - just like Keynes and and Malthus - says that people belong in boxes, in other words, they're not humans, they are what we say they are, not what they want what the human being himself thinks he is. and then Darwin writes in particular about race, and there are some very interesting quotes with him and parliamentarians where he explains geopolitical changes including with the Ottoman Empire through the lens of race, and the one of the last sentence of descent his last book is essentially I

people matter, is because they are deeply rooted in our educational framework, whether it's in Canada the US France Germany, these four characters represent biology, economics, politics, and sociology. and so for me that's really important because that framework is essentially where most of our leaders have  grown up intellectually. and so what's important about this, is that we have to escape in my view or we have to try and at least become really aware of what these ideas were, in order for us to be able to extricate ourselves.

human beings to keep an eye on their institutions so they don't become entirely corrupt but to point out that a that institutions contend towards corruption let's say as a consequence of the inappropriate expression of power is a very different thing than to say that the institutions themselves are built on something approximating exploitation

15:00manifest it appears to me that it's part and parcel of a much older biblical than British tradition and that is the flowering of this idea this strange idea that despite surface appearances that might be differences in wealth and Status the difference between the aristocracy even and the commoners human beings have an intrinsic dignity that's not to be um that's not to be trifled with certainly not economically and that's the spirit 15:30that manifested the rise of of democracy in Great Britain and also the spirit that animated the the formation of the US

own will as fundamentally oppressive so as soon as you mention the word god that becomes a source of Oppression oh wait a minute there's there's there's some higher standard than what I want to do with my life there's some higher standard than my whims or passions no no no no no no I'm that's oppressive I'm I'm being oppressed and so they almost 20:00see the individual as as a self-sustaining self-generating self-originating entity the problem with that is that if if that's true then on what basis are you going to claim that all individuals have equal dignity that no one individual should oppress another and that we should we should we should work together in a form of self-government and common Liberty I mean it gets to the problem that you've been talking about but I I think it's the idea really of God if we're coming right down to it ([Time 0:19:33](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0845ebd0480008917f3b))\n- \u003e we know that thoughts that are associated with 21:00self-consciousness are statistically indistinguishable from experiences of negative emotion so it's literally the case that the more you think about yourself the more unhappy you are unhappy anxious grief-strick and frustrated disappointment disappointed hurt and so then you think well where did people find the meaning that helps them abide through tragedy and turn their 21:30attention away from themselves and the answer is well we don't even have to introduce God into the picture at the moment you say well you find a fair bit of that sustaining meaning through reciprocal relationships you want to have an intimate relationship of some duration or it's just a series of short-term psychopathically narcissistic pit stops which don't seem to do anyone any good so you want to have an intimate relationship of some duration you probably want to have a 22:00family at least to have some contact with your parents and your siblings and perhaps even children if you dare to do that likely you need some friends you probably need something approximating a job or a career you have to be nested inside a series of superordinate social structures in order to be a functioning individual at all and so I think conservatives can to offer a rejoinder to the Liberals and say you you are assuming that individual autonomy is a higher good only because 22:30for centuries the individual was so ensconced and superordinate social Community by default that you could just ignore that that existed and now we can't do that anymore because people are so fractionated that they're abandoning well marriage they're abandoning family they're abandoning friendship I suppose in favor of its virtual alternative and that's catastrophic and I think young people know this

not so much by what you accrue to yourself but it's what you give away to other people it's who it's who you choose to serve what you choose to spend your life on and I think what modern liberalism tells people is demand your rights demand entitlements demand the Fulfillment of your desires what 23:30conservatives should be saying is go and find somebody to serve go and find something greater than yourself to be part of go and give your life to something and as you do you'll find that you are able to to make the world around you a better place and you don't do that by by again accruing things to yourself you don't do that by by piling up more rights you do that by giving yourself away in a sense which is I think a very fundamental truth that every husband knows every father knows and I think that that's something that that young 24:00people want to hear they want to be called to something greater than themselves and liberalism just doesn't offer that liberalism is is at the end of the day it's a cult of satisfying your own desire whatever it may be today and at least people fundamentally alone adrift and isolated

let's say then you're not a prisoner of each momentary whim and the reason for that is that all that happens if you are that is that you betray yourself and so we know for example that Psychopaths who are motivated by power and very manipulative and who are in it for the gratification of their own whims do very badly across any reasonable length of time they're 25:00completely incapable of learning from experience technically and what that means is they constantly betray themselves and so if you're pursuing an Impulse of Hedonism then to hell with you tomorrow fundamentally and next week and next year you continue to do things that are pleasurable or Escapist in the moment but all it does is drive you downhill across time because you should treat yourself as a community that extends across time ([Time 0:24:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b08c94ede0e00085303fd))\n- \u003e if you do want the best for yourself in some higher sense let's say yourself across time it's clearly the case that the most effective way to achieve that is to be unbelievably useful and generous to other people because there are a lot of other people and so if you're interacting with them in a manner 26:00that is let's say self-sacrificing in a reciprocal Manner and generous then they're going to want to interact with you and so if you interact with a thousand people in your life and you're generous to all them and they reciprocate then you're the beneficiary of a thousand acts of generosity a thousand continual sets of Acts of generosity how can that not be a better approach than trying to maximize your momentary whim ([Time 0:25:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b08ef43915b0008027b7b))\n- \u003e as the

left with a new hierarchy in the United States which is if you have an advanced degree and can 30:00earn a lot of money then you are the best and you have the most choices in life and you are the most valuable member of society if if you're not if if you are not somebody who who wants to go get a four-year college degree if you don't earn a lot of money then you're somehow less than you're lesser

something like the Dignity of work and service and if it's all about your rights and not about your responsibility and the meaning in your life is actually attendant on the responsibility then all that clamoring for rights just makes you makes your life devoid of any purposeful meaning and that strikes me as highly probable given that most purpose is equivalent in some sense to self-sacrifice

if we don't bring forth what is within us then there's a lack in the structure of reality and that lock produces undue pain and misery and suffering and so it is the case that each person needs to

They criticize the fact that those in power are mostly men and that’s the oppressing patriarchy against women.\n\nThis logic doesn’t hold true due to a couple reasons:\n\n1. You can’t even properly defined what this arbitrary “power” is. What kind of power? Political power? Economical power? Physical power? Psychological power? Is it the power your boss have over you? Or does it also count when one person is more likely to follow another one’s opinion in their relationship?\n\nEssentially, feminism is playing this game with such degree of ambiguity that it’s almost impossible to tell the exact kind of power they’re actually opposed to, instead they’re just pointing fingers at things they simply don’t like to see without really giving it a proper definition.\n\n正因為我們身處的「價值場域」是以極其複雜的方式、耗費漫長歲月才得以演進至今——縱連中國皇帝也未必能一意孤行地推翻前朝、乃至千百年累積的傳統典範——所以若將這一切歸因於「權力」或更廣義的「力量(Power)」、用輕率的二分法將人類劃分成壓迫和受壓迫者，那只是顯露了一個人對歷史的無知。更別說，許多人根本是打著「政治正確」的正義旗幟、實行著部落主義和獵巫行動。\n\n(見[[社會的價值階級]])\n\n一條魚若要批評池水污濁，得先認知到水是牠賴以生存的必要條件；如果牠輕蔑地以為自己不用水也能活得好好的，那實是對現實抱持了最根本的不敬。\n\n二戰至今，世界由啟蒙運動所開啟的現代主義思維，走進了對科學、理性、文化、體制等社會根基進行反省的後現代。人類開始思考自身存在之於整個地球的意義、開始收斂四百年來因科學進步而累積的過份自信、開始透過不同的意識形態去檢討社會民族之間的鬥爭角力。也於是，對於生態環境、弱勢族群、社會正義、全球化等議題的關切與著力逐漸在國際間萌芽。\n\n時間快轉到二十一世紀，佔據主流媒體的已普遍是自由派、甚至進步主義的聲音。在逐漸左傾的年輕世代（[相關閱讀](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010850061)）裡，社會結構越來越理所當然地被理解成「權力鬥爭」下的產物，無論鬥爭的主體是種族、宗教、階級、或性別（性向）。當「部分人壓迫其他人」的故事被輕易認定為人類歷史的縮影，社會議題就幾乎必須是某種「公平正義」問題——即使絕大多數的問題都絕非只是「壞人欺負好人」這麼單純。\n\n台灣，在獨特的歷史背景（中國傳統的帝制思維和政府遷台後的黨政記憶）和西方思潮的積極攝取（進步主義、女性主義、美國媒體和娛樂產業）之下，無論是貼著「傳統」或「先進」標籤的不同世代的人，都可以在「部分人壓迫其他人」的照樣照句裡找到自己認同的敘事：惡霸財團對農工的侵害、父權主義對女性的壓迫、有錢人對平民的操弄、獨裁政府（無論是否真的滿足這個詞的定義）對人民的欺侮……\n\n只要你有心，你總是可以替自己找到「我站在好人這一邊」、甚至「我其實是個受害者」的證據。\n\nQ：這樣想有什麼問題嗎？\n\nA：讓我先嚴謹且慎重地表示，我既不是要一竿子打翻所有的左派主張，更非對社會上的苦難與不義視若無睹。世界上的確存在許多受害者需要援助、社會中的確仍有許多問題需要修正，更別說，不幸的事也可能降臨在我身上。但在此同時，輕易將社會視為「權力鬥爭」的戰場、進以把自己看作「好人對抗壞人」故事裡正義（或受害）的一方，實是一件極其無知又自負的事情——就我的觀察，這正是許多先進國家社會正逐漸傾倒的方向。\n\n即便在動物社會裡，純粹的「力量」也從未是安身立命的長久之計：黑猩猩族群中的[Alpha Male](https://www.ted.com/talks/frans_de_waal_the_surprising_science_of_alpha_males)——一個近年被廣為濫／誤用的字眼——事實上往往是特別關心婦孺、樂於分享的仁君，而那些利用暴力和恐懼來統治的黑猩猩領袖，不僅得長期活在被推翻的焦慮裡（人類歷史上的暴君也多有此煩惱），更可能要實際承受[遭眾人變節且懷恨凌虐的下場](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/chimpanzees-chimp-tyrant-eat-cannibal-tyrannical-leader-propos-nothing-a7557916.html)。\n\n「力量」在人類社群中是個更加不管用的社會基礎。如果你觀察小孩在遊樂場上的互動，你會發現那些愛欺負別人的小霸王通常都不是最受冷落的對象，他們有敵人也有朋友；真正最不受歡迎的反而是那些有社交障礙的孩子。然而欺凌他人來換取注意力的行為，在國中就會開始顯得乏力，高中之後便是個挺糟的策略。\n\n(見[[道德的動物學基礎]])\n\n你我在成長過程中往往都會很自然地發現，懂得信任、合作、互惠是可以讓你在多數日子裡過得最順利的方式。我們學會配合他人、信任彼此；我今天替你出力、並相信你明天會為我做同樣的事；我們不需要將雙方施受的恩惠記在紙上供日後算帳，因為我們對彼此的為人和情誼抱持信心，不擔心會被辜負——這就是良好人際關係的最實際詮釋。\n\n在感情或婚姻關係中亦是如此：兩個人相互關心、為彼此付出，並假設對方也會為自己做一樣的事。如果你認為你的感情關係是建立在權力的鬥爭上，或如果你相信某些網路上的「兩性專家」會告訴你的「願意轉身離去的人擁有比較高的價值」，你可能會認為自己需要站在這段關係裡的上風、藉此讓對方滿足你的要求，但這麼做只會讓你成為感情中的暴君、而另一個人成為奴隸——這不會是你想要對待自己和你所愛之人的方式，它只會引領這段感情走上腐蝕心靈的死路。\n\n(見[[論「紅藥丸」與男性的生命責任]])\n\n2. Feminist view undermines the very value of individuals that are not in power (even in this arbitrary sense) and in a way downplays their role in the history of mankind.\n\nConsider the social structure of chimpanzees and bonobos, or the equivalents in human society: one patriarchal and the other matriarchal. Is the fact that one puts one gender in power for leadership and stable social structure, downplays the importance of another gender and essentially diminishes its value and contribution to the society?\n\nObviously, any gender, or any particular person doesn’t need to be in “power” to be deemed worthy and beneficial to the society, nor should any person be deemed less valuable only because the lack of “power”. It’d be foolish to think anyone that’s not in power is lesser than the ones who do, or as if those who lack in power are dispensable while those in power can maintain their importance.\n\nSociety is founded on many other pillars than mere power, thus to think one needs to be in power to prove his/her relevance is really to devalue the masses who do not, as well as oneself that isn’t yet in power. Feminism’s point of view essentially isn’t empowering women but downplaying this role in the history of mankind and evaluating their sovereign value by portraying them as victims.\n\nI’d suggest that we promote the very sovereignty of individuals as that’s the true foundation of our society. Every single person can matter as long as they strive to actively participate in the society, be it with power or not. There’re simply too many ways to contribute to the society and its just more right, more noble, and more useful to encourage a person to aim at the highest good one can manage. It might be the CEO of a huge corporation, or a housewife with 2 kids. They’re all important and the society needs every single one of us to strive for the goods we can create in this earth, not by any arbitrary standard or ideology, but by what we can conceive of as our calling.\n\n\n\n3. If one really think it through, one can see that the feminist logic isn’t really complaining about patriarchal society, but instead the very essence of competence.\n\nThose in power, even if they are mostly men, are still a very minority of people. While on the other hand of the spectrum, those in prisons, working dangerous jobs, or homeless, are mostly consist of men as well. If the oppressing patriarchy really is systematic oppression against women, then those living the most terrible lives would be women and not men.\n\nSo if feminism really sees what they’re truly against, they’ll realize they’re not against patriarchy, but any form of inequality produced by the very nature of competence.\n\nAs long as some people can do valuable things better than others, which will inevitably happen if we value one thing over the other in our society, it’ll produce inequality or outcome. If that leads to certain group of people having more power and that becomes a problem, than feminism is clearly blind to the fact that this inequality of competence is also essentially how capitalism produce wealth for all people and help create the thriving society we now enjoy.\n\nBut consider the alternative: communism has already shows how it can bring equality of outcome by bringing most people into poverty, while it still doesn’t solve the power problem and might even worsen it by putting the power into even smaller group of people’s hands.\n\nNovel prize winning economist Milton Friedman thus said \"Any society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither. On the other hand, a society that puts freedom first will, as a happy byproduct, end up with both greater freedom and greater equality”.\n\nAnd once again, that essentially tells us why it’s a better idea to promote individual sovereignty and give people the freedom to live their lives fully without any judgement from both the society’s standard or ideology. We might find more happy housewives as we no longer tell them to be ashamed about their choices, or we might find more female CEOs of the largest companies committed to their career. Or we might find that we’re not too far from the ideal after all, but now without no judgements and victimhood. Maybe the world where it’s truly equal is the place where people can live happily with all the inequality but no one is playing victims for any specific group identity. Maybe the world feminists should want is the world in which it’s no longer needed.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//Democracy/%E5%8E%BB%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E5%8C%96%E7%9A%84%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93%E8%AE%8A%E9%9D%A9":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: \nhttps://news.marsbit.co/20221125170623744167.html\n\n---\n## Highlights\n- “我認為，”SSC 寫道，“最廣闊、最無形的巨大無形之物就是技術進步。 ”\n  例如，他認為印刷機促成了新教改革、報紙、文藝復興、科學革命和民族主義的興起。 馬丁路德、達芬奇和以撒牛頓爵士都是傀儡。 印刷機是巨大的無形之物。 在發明之後，所有其他事情都註定要發生，無論最終是誰將它們變為現實。 “因此，歷史上最大的變化是對不同技術條件的預定反應。”\n  在這種觀點下，技術進步奠定了基礎，其他一切都在發揮其腳本作用。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg2q75ng7xwmjpf14ebyaqp))\n- 技術進步可能會在時代之間、過去的方式和未來的方式之間劃出更清晰的界限。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg2s03hdsvnjx6q17dpypd2))\n- 變革過程分為三個階段：\n  • **分離**：個人、團體或社會秩序被剝奪了先前定義的身份和地位的時期。\n  • **閾限期**：迷失方向的非結構或反結構時期，開闢了新的可能性，不再基於舊的地位或權力等級制度。 探索新的身份並考慮新的可能性。\n  • **重新定向**：個人、群體或社會秩序採用新身份、獲得新地位並設計更適合新身份的新結構的改革時期。\n  無論我們是進入第四次轉折、一場大型戰爭、生活在一個有限的空間，還是三者兼而有之，越來越明顯的是，我們正在走向另一邊的新事物。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg2vaz8rmqech24yvye9fqg))\n- 我們正在走向一個在各個方面都更加去中心化的時代——地緣政治、金融、教育、新聞和能源等等——由技術驅動，包括但不限於互聯網。 這個新的去中心化時代將需要新的基礎設施和組織原則，以適應去中心化系統固有的混亂和複雜性。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg2ya5vhjenjdg6w1nj79rv))\n- 我們越能在大規模範圍內進行交流，我們的物種就越能像一個單一的有機體一樣發揮作用，以人類的集體知識塔為大腦，每個人的大腦就像體內的神經或肌肉纖維。 隨著大眾傳播時代的到來，集體人類有機體——人類巨人——應運而生。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg2zcm6pqfpk7478tjt6hya))\n- 人類歷史可以被視為我們組織自己以滿足基本需求並試圖超越這些需求的方式的歷史。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg2zw3zvrxa4wje6fk37d8a))\n- 與我們今天的組織方式相比，人類在史前時期的組織方式是多種多樣的、創造性的和靈活的。 即便如此，我們還是在中心化和去中心化之間搖擺不定。\n  作者著手回答這個問題，「不平等從何而來？ “最後反而問，”我們是怎麼被困住的？ ”\n  Graeber 和 Wengrow 認為人類失去了我們遠古祖先享有的三種自由：\n  1. **離開或搬離周圍環境的自由**\n  2. **不服從他人命令的自由**\n  3. **塑造全新社會現實或在不同社會現實之間來回轉換的自由**\n  作者指出，重要的是，前兩種自由“通常充當第三種更具創造性的自由的腳手架”。 搬遷和不服從命令的權利賦予了人們試驗社會現實的自由。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg35ggym59971qy31tpngw5))\n- Graeber 和 Wengrow 不同意 SSC 將技術進步視為巨大無形之物，他們寫道：\n  \u003e 選擇相反的方式來描述歷史，即一系列突如其來的技術革命，每一次都伴隨著我們成為自己創造物的長期囚徒，這是有後果的。 歸根結底，這是一種將我們這個物種表現得比實際證明的更缺乏思想、更缺乏創造力、更不自由的方式。 這意味著不把歷史描述為一系列連續不斷的新思想和創新，無論是技術的還是其他的，在此期間，不同的社區集體決定他們認為哪些技術適合應用於日常目的，哪些技術僅限於實驗或儀式遊戲領域。 當然，技術創造力對社會創造力更是如此...... 在人類歷史上，儀式遊戲區域一次又一次地充當了社會實驗的場所——甚至在某些方面，它是一部關於社會可能性的百科全書。\n  \u003e 我認為我剛剛分享的圖表，無論畫得多麼糟糕，都可以解決這兩個論點。 人們應該能夠在沙盒中進行實驗和玩耍，以發現風險較低的新技術和社交工具（所有小點），但肯定有一個總體形狀，因為一些技術和社會結構以 Vast Formless Things（正弦波）為主。 那麼，我們不是偶人，而是實驗主義者。\n  無論史前史的事實將我們引向現代史，事實仍然是現代社會建立在等級結構中，處於不斷變化的中心化程度，以實現越來越複雜的事物。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg3bbhg5zw9hzqefr5zp5ak))\n- 我不單純地認為中心化或去中心化本質上是好是壞。 正如我們所討論的，中心化系統是為了解決之前去中心化系統的缺點，而去中心化系統是為了解決中心化系統的缺點。 這是一個進步。 每個都有它存在的時間和地點。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg3etqmp0g6a3bfh1y1c8ks))\n- 事實上，足夠先進的技術應該可以擁有完美的中心化系統或完美的去中心化系統。 烏托邦共產主義可能會在完美的數據和協調下運作。 烏托邦式的自由市場可以用完美的資訊和無交易成本解決科斯的企業理論。\n  我要說的是，我們正在接近當前中心化時代的局部最大值，並且我們正在走向一個品質和複雜性比我們今天所處的系統更高水準的去中心化時代。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg3fhpbafcv0x0w2p8xm0hk))\n- 在我們討論過的所有中心化和去中心化示例的背景下，都有大量無形之物以新技術的形式潛伏在幕後。 武器、船隻、機器。 舉個最明顯的例子，如果沒有印刷機，很難想像全球帝國或大規模代議制民主的興起。 今天很多事情的運作方式——從我們組織公司的方式到我們吃的食物，再到我們教育孩子的方式——都是工業革命的產物。\n  重大的社會變革是由重大的技術變革驅動的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg3gm9g76tk0rvtrvwsaj36))\n- 從化石燃料向太陽能、風能、地熱能和核能等可再生能源的轉變將在一系列層面上進行去中心化，從最大到最小。\n  掌握能源的國家，掌握了自己的命運;

But Taiwan’s success in this regard was not a fluke. Rather, these capacities come from the Taiwanese government’s long-standing open-mindedness to reinventing its governmental institutions and overall strategic posture based on the capabilities made possible by the latest advances in technology.\n\n**在全球範圍內，人們普遍認為臺灣的影響力超過了其重量，無論是在科技、工業還是治理創新領域。這種看法在很大程度上是正確的，原因很簡單：它必須這樣做。** 這個民主和事實上獨立的國家位於中國大陸東南沿海，是西方的重要盟友，也是中國共產黨的眼中釘，中國共產黨自1949年中國內戰的失敗方建立台灣以來，一直正式聲稱臺灣是中國大陸的叛變省份。臺灣政府的人口和經濟規模只有中華人民共和國（PRC）的一小部分，臺灣政府一直知道，臺灣的持續獨立存在將取決於優越的戰略，**經濟發展、技術創新和制度靈活性構成這種戰略的核心。**\n\nWith a population and economy just a fraction the size of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Taiwan’s government has always known that its continued independent existence would depend on superior strategy, with economic development, technological innovation, and institutional flexibility forming the core of such a strategy.\n\n在整個20世紀，臺灣政府有意識地努力建立一個本土的工業基地，然後在其上建立一個本土的「矽谷」，以模仿西方最好的部分。具有諷刺意味的是，這些努力現在已經超越了西方本身，也產生了一個高度信任、高度技術素養的政府和社會，他們能夠將外交政策所必需的同樣開放和戰略思維應用於國內問題。\n\n# 數位和民主政府\n\n臺灣是世界上最早發現和應對這種迅速發展的大流行的國家之一，部分原因是**一名高級政府衛生官員在臺灣最大的在線留言板上閱讀了一篇關於一種從中國傳播的新疾病的高度投票的帖子。**[3]在其他情況下，這可能是一個有趣的軼事，但在臺灣，這個細節象徵著臺灣的大流行反應與大多數其他國家相比如此異常有效的原因。不僅政府的反應值得讚揚的是該國在COVID上的成功，而且是**中央集權的國家機構與整個民間社會之間的富有成效的互動，其中國家開發了分散的公共使用的集中式系統，相反，它關注並賦予沒有政府頭銜的普通人提供的有用舉措和資訊的合法性。**\n\nIt was not only the government’s response that deserves credit for the country’s success on COVID, but rather the productive interactions between centralized state institutions and civil society at large, where the state develops centralized systems for decentralized, public use, and conversely pays attention to and confers legitimacy on useful initiatives and information provided by ordinary people without government titles.\n\n**除了有關COVID-19通過臺灣互聯網迅速傳播的新聞和資訊受到普通公民和政府官員的監控外，“公民駭客”還與政府合作，迅速建立了工具，幫助人們避免感染併為大流行做好準備，例如實時感染地圖和機器人，以打擊有關該病毒的錯誤資訊。**現有的集中努力，如將國家健康保險數據與海關和移民機構整合，個人數據的在線報告，建立國家疾病控制指揮中心，以及迅速開發的新工作，如手機跟蹤，增加口罩生產和檢疫程式，都被證明是決定性的 - 但只有自願的， 知情和熱情地參與數位活躍的公眾，既相信政府的措施，又在十多年前SARS襲擊全國時也經歷過大流行，並記住了口罩的重要性等重要教訓。所有這些因素加在一起，為臺灣的成功提供了動力。在包括美國在內的西方，儘管採取了一些類似的行動，例如建立在線監測工具，但沒有社會信任和機構能力的基線來使用這些工具。\n\nIn addition to news and information about COVID-19 rapidly spreading through the Taiwanese internet being monitored by both ordinary citizens and government officials alike, “civic hackers” quickly built tools in collaboration with the government to help people avoid infection and prepare for the pandemic, such as live infection maps and bots to combat misinformation about the virus.(https://consilienceproject.org/taiwans-digital-democracy/#fn-5 \"go to footnote\") Both existing centralized efforts, such as integration of national health insurance data with customs and immigration institutions, online reporting of personal data, and the establishment of a national Command Center for disease control, as well as quickly developed new ones, such as cell phone tracking, ramping up mask production, and quarantine procedures, all proved to be decisive—but only with the voluntary, informed, and enthusiastic participation of a digitally active public that both trusted government measures and had also previously lived through a pandemic when SARS struck the nation more than a decade earlier, and remembered crucial lessons such as the importance of face masks.(https://consilienceproject.org/taiwans-digital-democracy/#fn-6 \"go to footnote\") All of these factors combined to power Taiwan’s success.

Moreover, this isn’t even just because the Taiwanese government has successfully digitized most of its functions, but because it deliberately wanted to design a system where citizens would enjoy online ease of access to any conceivable government service.\n\n另一項政府運營的網路服務允許公民在起草和實施立法和政策問題時查詢和討論這些問題，包括公民直接向政府機構負責人發送電子郵件的功能。\n使用非常簡單和適當的URL www.gov.tw 登錄這個中央入口網站的臺灣公民，能夠快速找到從出生證明到登記死亡的政府服務的連結，以及在兩者之間的任何生命階段可能有用的所有其他服務，根據一個大概是臺灣火柴人從出生起的生活的圖形，有組織，相當字面上， 接受教育，工作，然後退休和死亡。搜索網站目錄可以生成資訊和表格，涵蓋從兵役到登記選舉候選人的所有內容，包括國家政府以及市和縣政府。政府運營著一個名為MyData的平臺，該平台允許公民在經過適當驗證后下載政府擁有的任何資訊，例如房屋或車輛擁有權登記，保險狀況，個人收入數據，甚至他們自己的國民身份證照片。[11]另一項政府運營的網路服務允許公民在起草和實施立法和政策問題時查詢和討論這些問題，包括公民直接向政府機構負責人發送電子郵件的功能。[12]\n\nTaiwanese citizens who log on to this central web portal, using the very simple and appropriate URL www.gov.tw, are able to quickly find links to government services from birth certificates to registering deaths and every other service that might be useful at any stage of life in between, organized, quite literally, according to a graphic of a presumably Taiwanese stick-man’s life from birth, to education, work, and then retirement and death. Searching the site directory yields information and forms covering everything from military service to registering candidacies for elections, from both the national government as well as city and county governments. The government operates a platform called MyData that allows citizens-—after proper verification--to download any information the government has on them, such as home or vehicle ownership registration, insurance status, personal income data, and even their own national ID photograph. Another government-operated web service allows citizens to inquire about and discuss legislation and policy issues as they are being drafted and implemented, including a feature for citizens to send emails directly to the heads of government agencies. \n\n這種數位化也延伸到政府服務的後端：早在2000年，臺灣政府機構就開始在專用的寬頻互聯網網路上以電子方式交換檔，並維護一個官方的在線系統，用於政府採購，包括一個不滿意的承包商資料庫。[13]臺灣政府的計算機化推動可以追溯到1980年代，儘管是在1997年，研究發展與評估委員會（RDEC）建立了政府的“骨幹網路”，並開始推動政府運營和服務的數位化。在2000年代初，這也包括官方努力將互聯網接入帶到農村地區。[14]到2019年，臺灣的互聯網普及率為人口的93%，98%的互聯網使用者使用手機連接到網路。[15]\n\nThis digitization extends to the back end of government services as well: Taiwanese government agencies began exchanging documents electronically all the way back in the year 2000 on a dedicated broadband internet network, as well as maintaining an official online system for government procurement, including a database of unsatisfactory contractors. The Taiwanese government’s computerization push dates from the 1980s, though it was in 1997 that the Research Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) established the government’s “backbone network” and began the push for digitizing government operations and services. In the early 2000s, this also included official efforts to bring internet access to rural areas. By 2019, the internet penetration rate in Taiwan stood at 93% of the population, with 98% of internet users using a mobile phone to connect to the web. \n\n臺灣龐大的數位足跡（包括政府和民間）以及與中國大陸不良關係自然會給該國帶來嚴重的網路安全問題。臺灣政府每月面臨2000萬至4000萬次網路攻擊，其中每月約有10萬次專門針對國家安全局的攻擊。[16]此外，大約80%的成功攻擊被確定為來自中國大陸也就不足為奇了。[17]第一次「台中駭客戰爭」一直發生在1999年，當時中國大陸對當時的臺灣總統的聲明進行了報復，當時中國駭客滲透臺灣計算機網路超過160次。[18]這一事件促使臺灣國家資訊與安全工作組（NICST）成立，該工作組是臺灣政府網路防禦的主要組織，直到2016年政府成立網路安全部。此後不久，臺灣總統蔡英文創建了資訊、通信和電子部隊司令部（ICEF），作為一個獨立的軍事司令部，負責對抗中國的「駭客軍隊」。。這個獨立的網路戰司令部是世界上第一個此類指揮部。根據蔡英文總統的說法，「網路安全就是國家安全。[19]\n\n\u003e **臺灣政府不僅長期帶頭整合數位政府的創新，而且本身也有責任帶頭發展臺灣科技產業，作為其經濟發展和國家主權整體戰略的一部分。**\n\u003e \n\u003e The Taiwanese government has not only long spearheaded and integrated innovations in digital government, but is itself responsible for spearheading the development of Taiwan’s technology industry as part of its overall strategy for economic development and national sovereignty.\n\n正如中國大陸試圖破壞臺灣的數位足跡以利於其利益一樣，它也試圖利用臺灣的民主話語。自1980年代末台灣開始自由化以來，臺灣的媒體和新聞業蓬勃發展，新聞相對自由，儘管也可以說也受到小報聳人聽聞的支配。[20]臺灣四大報紙在社論上因同情或反感與中國大陸統一而分裂。《中國時報》和《聯合日報》被廣泛認為是民族主義的，同情中國。《自由時報》——其擁有者還出版了臺灣最大的英文報紙《台北時報》——和《蘋果日報》被廣泛認為是親台獨立和反華的。然而，這些分歧不僅僅是社論：蘋果Daily的香港居民創始人於2020年因違反香港新《國家安全法》而被中國政府逮捕，並於2021年被判處14個月監禁。相反，《中國時報》的大亨老闆住在上海，在中國大陸擁有巨大的商業利益，在意識形態上支援統一。[21]多年來，中國故意利用其經濟和人口影響力，以及國內的審查制度，將臺灣的媒體話語轉向親中國的方向。[22]\n\n\n\n# 建設臺灣的矽谷\n\n直覺上，像台灣這樣的全球數位政府領導者也是全球技術領導者，這是有道理的。但究竟為什麼會這樣呢？簡單地說，是因為臺灣政府不僅長期帶頭整合數位政府的創新，而且本身也有責任帶頭發展臺灣科技產業，作為其經濟發展和國家主權整體戰略的一部分。\n\n以目前的一個專案為例，在該國尋求約13.4億美元的外國研發投資，同時花費約3.5億美元的補貼來説明吸引資本。[23]至關重要的是，與許多其他國家花費大量資金將自己轉變為資訊技術驅動的服務經濟不同，臺灣實際上可以令人信服地將資本轉化為有價值的研發。最好的理由不是統計——國內的博士學位數量不能告訴我們這些博士學位是否真的是技能的證據，或者國家是否擁有使用這些技能的社會技術。相反，我們注意到臺灣是臺灣半導體製造公司台積電等傑出科技集團的所在地，台積電是世界領先的積體電路供應商，為蘋果等公司供貨。[24]該公司由莫裡斯·張（Morris Chang）於1980年代末創立，當時Chang曾在美國多家晶元製造商工作，並意識到他可以在臺灣創建一家公司，只需製造美國工程師夢想的任何東西：“無製造商的鑄造廠”。[25]這一戰略最近導致台積電與韓國三星公司通過與包括美國AMD在內的外部設計師合作，成功擊敗美國的英特爾，分別在2018年和2020年製造7奈米級和5奈米級晶元。[26]台積電對世界經濟的中心地位在2021年的晶元短缺中得到了生動的體現，這在很大程度上是由需求激增和一些原材料短缺引起的。\n\n雖然這可以證明臺灣的製造能力，而不是研發能力，但該國通過自然擴張人力資源和資本來控制相當數量的市場的能力也顯示了研發實力。台灣擁有受過高等教育的工作力，45%的工作年齡人口擁有學士學位，而美國工人的這一比例為44%，中國工人的這一比例為17%。[27][28]隨著它的發展，這個國家也證明瞭自己在文化上能夠利用國外的教育體系來提高自己工作力的技能——莫裡斯·張（Morris Chang）本人在麻省理工學院和斯坦福大學接受教育，然後才創立台積電。\n\n\u003e**無論是在技術、工業還是善政方面，從日本到韓國再到臺灣，東亞各國政府都試圖複製一些成功的西方效應，並最終建立一個完整的合理化制度體系，旨在產生和維持這種效應，往往最終得到一個比最初產生相關成功的混亂和偶然的西方體系更精簡的體系。**\n\u003e\n\u003eWhether it’s in technology, industry, or good governance, East Asian governments from Japan to South Korea to Taiwan seek to replicate some successful Western effect, and end up building an entire rationalized institutional system that is geared to produce and maintain that effect, often ending up with a far more streamlined system than the messy and contingent Western system which produced the success in question in the first place.\n\n台積電也不是臺灣第一家半導體公司。第一個是聯合微電子公司，仍然存在，並與台積電一起從1973年成立的臺灣政府研發機構工業技術研究院（ITRI）中分離出來。工研院的總部設在新竹科技園區內，這是一個由臺灣國家與臺灣頂尖大學協調建立的工業園區，通常被稱為臺灣的“矽谷”。新竹公園是由臺灣國立清華大學前校長、時任國家科技部部長徐賢修提出的。[29]徐賢修曾周遊世界，尋找改善臺灣科技產業的有效策略，並受到加州矽谷的直接啟發。\n\n台灣獨立前三十年的財政部長李國挺在1970年代末，甚至向斯坦福大學工程學院院長弗雷德里克·特曼（Frederick Terman）諮詢了讓去過海外的臺灣國民返回臺灣科技部門的正確策略。特曼不僅本身就是一個聰明的技術頭腦，而且是第二次世界大戰後斯坦福大學自己的公私合作研究戰略的建築師，也是斯坦福工業園（今天更名為斯坦福研究園）的建築師，該工業園為惠普，瓦里安，施樂PARC，史蒂夫·賈伯斯的NeXT等公司提供了實體之家。 特斯拉和幾十年來的臉書。[30]“矽谷”設計的成功創建，證明瞭臺灣政府的遠見卓識和運營能力。\n\n這是工業化晚期的東方模仿西方的一個反覆出現的現象的例子：無論是在技術、工業還是善政方面，從日本到韓國再到臺灣，東亞各國政府都試圖複製一些成功的西方效應，並最終建立一個完整的合理化制度體系，旨在產生和維持這種效應。 通常最終會得到一個比混亂和偶然的西方系統更精簡的系統，後者首先產生了有問題的成功。\n\n新竹公園建成后，企業和政府機構蜂擁而至，被優惠的稅收減免和合用同一地點所吸引。台積電和聯華電子現在都設在園區內，其他各種外國和國內公司以及台灣航太局也是如此。交通大學和國立清華大學總部設在隔壁。這不是一個意外，而是一個意外。Shu故意模仿矽谷與伯克利和斯坦福的接近。總體而言，這一戰略似乎取得了巨大的成功。斯坦福大學的官員現在定期訪問。\n\n# 地緣政治角度\n\n很難找到一個像臺灣這樣明顯受到地緣政治邏輯約束的國家。自1949年建島以來，該島一直被共產黨統治的中國大陸視為一個流氓的分離省份，當時蔣介石及其民族主義國民黨（國民黨）政府逃往該島，直到今天正式被稱為中華民國 - 這意味著執政的中國共產黨是非法的篡位者。兩岸關係在1990年代末確實實現瞭解凍，當時中國大陸選擇了與臺灣經濟一體化的戰略，旨在最終統一，但近年來，兩岸關係已經恢復到高度緊張的狀態，部分原因是上述拒絕與大陸進一步經濟一體化的太陽花學生運動，以及中國從那時起相應地採取更具侵略性的姿態。隨著大陸的復興已經基本趕上，在軍事技術等一些領域已經超越了發展較早的臺灣，該島作為事實上的獨立國家的未來看起來不確定。\n\n\u003e**人們不應低估來自北京的這種壓力在多大程度上直接轉化為臺灣的有效回應。**\n\u003e\n\u003eOne should not underestimate the extent to which this pressure from Beijing has directly translated into effective responses in Taiwan.\n\n**臺灣對中國大陸入侵的強烈擔憂，有可能為長期從事技術和工業規劃，維持國家與人民之間的信任與合作，提供了必要的民族凝聚力和信任。** 正如第一次世界大戰時期的知識分子倫道夫·伯恩所說，戰爭確實是國家的健康。撇開利潤不談，這足以成為追求工業和技術自給自足的理由。\n\nIt is possible that Taiwan's highly warranted apprehension of an invasion by the mainland Chinese has provided the national cohesion and trust necessary to undertake long-term efforts in technological and industrial planning, and maintain trust and collaboration between the state and the people. As WWI-era intellectual Randolph Bourne put it, war is indeed the health of the state. Profits aside, this is reason enough to pursue industrial and technological autarky.\n\n同時，人們不應低估來自北京的這種壓力在多大程度上直接轉化為臺灣的有效應對措施。即使在國防領域本身也是如此。從純粹的理論角度來看，台灣是絕對站得住腳的。佔領該島將需要歷史上最大的兩棲入侵，並且只有在一年中幾個月的特定數量的狹窄灘頭陣地上才有可能。通過防禦工事、地形、對大陸的網路和導彈攻擊、城市戰爭、狂熱的近乎自殺的公民參與，以及美國封鎖新加坡附近麻六甲海峽的可行可能性，人們確實可以想像一個可信的臺灣向北京發出的信號，即他們真的不值得入侵的代價。[31]\n\n然而，當我們檢視臺灣目前的現實時，我們看不到這樣的信號。中國分析家坦納·格裡爾（Tanner Greer）令人信服地斷言，他對臺灣今天的地緣政治態勢持更悲觀的看法，對臺灣安全研究人員、最近退伍的新兵、執政的民進黨官員、武器工程師以及現役的中華民國陸軍和海軍軍官進行了九個多月的採訪。根據格裡爾的說法，臺灣人根本沒有意願將他們的島嶼變成一個“堅不可摧的堡壘”。**近二十年左右的挑戰包括軍隊和國家服務機構內部的癱瘓，黨派僵局，糟糕的軍事戰略，糟糕的軍事訓練和採購，軍隊人才流失以及政治階層的失敗主義精神。**[32]當然，這些安全問題只是大陸可以利用的最明顯的弱點。經濟壓力，甚至海上封鎖似乎比入侵的可能性要大得多。這更是臺灣在與軍事事務沒有直接關係的技術和工業領域進行創新和能力建設的原因，但**如果沒有軍事能力來支持這些領域，它們最終仍然脆弱。**\n\nChallenges in the recent two decades or so include paralysis within the military and national service establishment, partisan gridlock, poor military strategy, poor military training and procurement, brain drain from the military, and a spirit of defeatism among the political class. These security concerns are of course only the most obvious weaknesses that the mainland could exploit; economic pressure and even a naval blockade appear far more likely than an invasion. This is all the more reason for Taiwan to pursue innovation and capacity-building in areas of technology and industry not directly related to military affairs—but without the military capacity to back these spheres up, they remain ultimately vulnerable.\n\n\u003e**只有有了這種（工業）基礎，創新的良性迴圈才能起飛——即使是看似無關緊要的創新，比如軟體領域，最終都來自矽技術的重大突破，並且必須與不斷發展的硬體系統同步進行**\n\u003e\n\u003eOnly with this (industrial) base can the virtuous cycle of innovation take off—even seemingly immaterial innovation, such as in the realm of software, both ultimately comes from material breakthroughs in silicon technology and must be undertaken in tandem with evolving systems of hardware.\n\n\n技術不是憑空而來的，政府僅僅花錢刺激創新，或者建立研發機構和經濟特區是不夠的。相反，**一個蓬勃發展的創新生態系統需要一個工業基礎。新技術必須反覆運算和製造，技術人員必須能夠利用大量的技術人員和訣竅。** 只有有了這個基礎，創新的良性迴圈才能起飛——即使是看似無關緊要的創新，比如在軟體領域，最終都來自矽技術的重大突破，並且必須與不斷發展的硬體系統同步進行。由於國家在政治經濟學體系的地球化中發揮著至關重要的作用，例如通過實施有效的產業政策，工業和技術可以蓬勃發展，所有這些都與公共政策問題密切相關。[33]\n\nTechnology does not come from a vacuum, and it is not enough for a government to merely spend money on spurring innovation, or to establish R\u0026D institutes and special economic zones. Rather, a thriving innovation ecosystem requires an industrial base. New technologies must be iterated upon and manufactured, and technologists must be able to draw upon a deep pool of technical personnel and know-how. Only with this base can the virtuous cycle of innovation take off—even seemingly immaterial innovation, such as in the realm of software, both ultimately comes from material breakthroughs in silicon technology and must be undertaken in tandem with evolving systems of hardware. And since the state has a crucial role in terraforming systems of political economy such that industry and technology can flourish, for example by implementing effective industrial policy, all of this is intimately bound up in problems of public policy.\n\n\n臺灣工業體系的起源並不難看出，因為它們在整個20世紀下半葉都密切關注國家政策。在20世紀50年代，該島政府剛剛脫離日本帝國和中國大陸本身的控制範圍，奉行**進口替代**政策 - 通過該政策阻止製成品的進口以增加對國內生產商品的需求 - 作為第二次世界大戰後經濟復甦的手段。到1960年代，為了刺激增長和加速工業化進程，臺灣決策者轉向**出口導向**政策，即國家通過挑選和支援那些能夠製造最多出口商品的企業來刺激工業企業之間的激烈競爭，著眼於擺脫他們所支援的新興產業，迫使它們最終自給自足， 一個稱為出口紀律的概念。在整個1960年代和1970年代，這一策略奏效了，臺灣的工業部門也隨之發展。[34]\n\n隨著1970年代的過去，這一體系遇到了一些障礙，特別是當那十年的石油危機開始蠶食利潤時。臺灣的工業化戰略，迄今為止一直以勞動密集型產業為主，以最大限度地雇用人口，不再具有經濟意義，島上的精英們發現，僅僅趕上西方是不夠的。在1970年代末和1980年代初，臺灣政府再次改變策略，將政策轉向支持資本和技術密集型產業作為發展途徑。為了重振增長和深化工業體系，臺灣決策者利用他們建立的戰後工業基礎為基礎，創建了我們今天所知道的高功能技術體系。例如，新竹科學工業園區成立於1980年。進入20世紀80年代，政府開始將特定的戰略產業作為能力建設和創新的焦點——其中最早的產業是半導體——這一戰略性經濟規劃過程一直持續到今天。[35]\n\n雖然來自北京的威脅越來越大，這籠罩著臺灣的成功，但如果讓最近的緊張局勢和不確定性蒙蔽我們對臺灣政府非凡成就的判斷，那將是一個錯誤。幾十年來，臺灣一直通過將技術創新與制度靈活性相結合來確保其主權，正如最近對COVID-19大流行的民主化和巨大成功的應對所表明的那樣。無論台灣的未來如何，很明顯，臺灣已經為我們提供了一個寶貴的案例研究，研究制度在塑造公共政策、工業和技術方面的力量。\n\n# Footnotes\n\n1.

愛沙尼亞的網路發展\n\n愛沙尼亞人口131萬，距離極權大國俄羅斯，從首都塔林到俄羅斯邊界的金吉利普，開車只要三小時；而俄羅斯同中國，公認擁有實力強大的駭客網軍。\n\n1992年獨立的愛沙尼亞，成為全球數位經濟爭相學習的對象。愛沙尼亞是網路電話Skype的故鄉。Skype創業者高價賣給eBay後，賺了第一桶金繁衍不息，孕育與投資了更多新創。愛沙尼亞人口只有0.3%在高科技產業工作，卻貢獻了全國大部分的經濟。在數位安全、自由度都名列前茅。\n\n---\n# 推動數位化\n\n愛沙尼亞走上數位之路，其實是受到芬蘭的刺激。愛沙尼亞在納入蘇聯前，曾短暫獨立過，那時他們與芬蘭所得水準差不多。然後，冷戰讓兩國分屬兩個陣營，90年代芬蘭比愛沙尼亞有錢八倍。愛沙尼亞當時連家用電話都不普及，芬蘭卻有諾基亞。\n\n愛沙尼亞早在90年代中期，愛沙尼亞就推動中學生寫程式；與私部門合作，自鄉下建立網路中心，教中老年人上網。\n\n除了推動小學生學程式，愛沙尼亞也跳過傳統基礎建設、優先打造數位基礎建設的靈魂人物。\n\n如今，愛沙尼亞1500種服務都架在數位基礎建設X-Road平台上，不論人在那裡，都可以用數位身分證，加上數位簽章網上進行。數位簽章可用瞳孔辨識。三分之一的人網路投票。唯一必須本人現身的只有三件事，第一是結婚，第二是離婚，第三是買土地。\n\n---\n# 如何打造數位國\n\n現在科技是一種很廉價，大家都可以做的事情。問題是，一個國家有沒有政治意志，如果你有，就會去制定政策，有政策就可以讓你去推動法律。在民主社會，有法律就有框架、法規、規範去管控一切。然後，你要有一個安全、健全的識別系統，在安全的架構下，提供大家想要的服務。\n\n---\n# 資料完整性\n\n比起把數位治理的討論重點放在隱私權，**資料完整度與正確性（Integrity）**要更重要。\n\n隱私是個文化接受度的問題，即使在歐盟，法國、德國的隱私權要求就比北歐高。歐洲特別重視隱私，但這是弄錯焦點：**關鍵不只是誰能不能看，重點應該是不能讓任何人能竄改他。** 因為越來越仰賴資料的新時代，竄改可能致命，陷人於罪，譬如血型、銀行帳戶等。\n\n以2016美國大選為例，俄國駭入民主黨希拉蕊助理的郵箱，他們不僅偷了資料，更關鍵是串改了內容，然後公布假電郵。這才是真正的大問題。\n\n分散式帳本能夠解決這個難題。在愛沙尼亞，區塊鏈公司要求使用者用ID卡登錄，以確保實名制。\n\n---\n# 三種新的社會秩序\n\n新社會秩序不確定性在於，有三種模式正在競爭：一是企業主導，隱私權管制極少的美國模式；二是與政府監控人民所有生活的中國大陸與俄羅斯模式。 三是資料屬於個人，政府規管嚴格的歐盟模式。\n\n美國模式，Google可以確保每個人在他的王國中的數位身分，出了他的王國，就不能使用。\n\n中國模式，數位創新速度飛快。甚至要用資料把人民信用分級，決定你能不能出國、借款利率。\n\n但位於歐洲的愛沙尼亞，發展了一個新模式，透過政府基礎建設，人民的數位身分證、數位簽章被認可有法律地位。這是小國的優勢。愛沙尼亞的數位基礎建設X-Road已經輸出歐盟多國與日本，用自己的方式迎向數位世紀。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Democracy/%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86":{"title":"","content":"tags:

CBPR\n\n**談到資料治理的法律問題，最常被討論的是個資保護與資料治理之間如何並存**；我國在討論個資保護時，經常將此視為天賦人權的一種，似乎是不可質疑的前提。\n\n其實，「個資保護」概念直到1980年代才出現，因當時電腦科技出現，個人資料變得容易複製流通，才有應賦予個人對其資料有自主控制權的觀念，藉此保護20世紀初以來逐漸受重視的個人隱私權。\n\n然而，此觀念主要由歐盟加以制度化，並推廣於其他國家，至今卻仍未成為美國的主流法政策。\n\n主因在於，**美國是以「維持隱私權」此一較傳統的觀念為主。在隱私權模式下，個人對其資料並無自主控制權，個人相關資訊的流通，應以社會生活合理界線為準，是否構成侵害隱私，要由個案情境進行認定**。歐盟推動的個資保護法制，則是以相對明確的程序規定作為合法與否的判斷。簡言之，就是當事人事前同意，或有法律規定依據，才是合法進行個資蒐集處理利用。\n\n\u003eComment: 可參考[[普通法系]]\n\n美國與歐盟在此一法制上的歧異，衍生出在國際上兩大架構，一是以**歐盟的「個人資料保護基本規則」（GDPR）**，另一為**美國主導的「跨境隱私規則」（CBPR）**，後者強調在數位時代資料跨境傳輸應盡量不受限制。應注意的是，我國在APEC架構下已加入CBPR架構，近期並加入了「全球跨境隱私規則論壇」（Global CBPR Forum），將共同推動CBPR的全球化。\n\n強調個人對其資料的自主控制權，表面上很符合當代重視個人自主選擇的思維；但**GDPR的實際運作結果卻顯示，以個人同意為前提的資料蒐集利用，其實對數位平台巨頭來說輕而易舉**——因為，網路使用者為了使用平台的免費服務，往往輕易就點選同意相關使用條款；相對地，新創小型業者要獲得當事人同意提供個資就困難得多。因此，**GDPR反助長了數位經濟的大者恆大效應。**\n\n\n# 資料透明公開，有助民主互信及抵禦分化\n\n另一方面，**在公共議題上，個人若能自由選擇是否提供資料，許多公共資料庫將會變得殘缺不全，或至少在提供外部研究利用時會是如此**。結果將導致，除非我們將所有涉及公共利益的資料利用型態都立法給予法律依據，否則無法利用；**這不僅對公共政策的資料治理非常不利，更會造成社會資本的侵蝕。**\n\n在此所謂「社會資本」，就是民間社會長期累積的一種相互信任與合作基礎，此種信任合作必須藉由資料公開透明來維繫。例如，北歐國家因有強大的社會福利體制，故民眾相互信任及對大有為政府的監督，成為關鍵。\n\n\u003eComment: 參考法蘭西斯．福山——《信任：社會德性與經濟繁榮》\n\n**堅實的社會互助體系，有賴社會信任與資料透明來維繫。** 以北歐國家挪威為例，他們採用了「薪資透明化」（pay transparency），每個人都可上網查詢他人的薪資與繳稅紀錄。\n\n**相對的，脆弱的社會資本，往往是極權政府鞏固其統治正當性的根源；因此，以資料透明強化社會資本，乃是保障民主政治的重要基石。**\n\n**個資保護固然是為了維護個人隱私權，但個資保護在此只應作為手段，而非目的；亦即不應將個資保護絕對化，唯有在隱私保護的必要範圍內，才是合理。** 若是攸關公共政策研究與公眾信任的資料，不應以個資保護為藉口而阻礙其利用；即使資料涉及個人隱私，若去識別化就足以保護隱私，亦不應讓資料當事人以資料自主控制權為由，主張刪除；否則就是把「保護手段」變成了目的。\n\n換言之，在個資保護法制上，我們面臨兩種路線的選擇：一是要維持現行個資法中，以盡量降低資料流通來保護個人隱私的原則；或是應建構一套真正能促進資料流通利用，同時又保障個人資訊隱私的模式。\n\n如前所述，**資料流通利用對民主的社會合作基礎，及公共政策品質的監督有著不可取代的作用。 對台灣而言，資料透明公開，也是對抗極權國家滲透與分化的最佳防禦機制。**\n\n# 以資料治理因應變局，避免民粹化政治\n\n無論個資或非個資，對資料治理都同等重要，只是個資需要特別考慮個人隱私權益保護，因此其流通利用需有一定的保護機制。然而當吾人強調資料治理是當代公共政策重要基石之同時，也不應忽略**資料治理與民主治理之間存在著某種緊張關係。**\n\n所謂民主治理，就是各政黨針對未來環境變化與特定價值理念而提出政策主張，選民透過投票選擇支持某一方。\n\n然而，當前科技變遷速度甚快，且政策環境牽涉太多未知的知識與資訊，早已超越政黨所能預測分析的範圍。現在，各國政黨絕少能在選舉中，對世界政治經濟局勢與民眾將面對的環境變化，提出清晰的分析與願景，只能依賴行政部門在有限資料基礎上，進行因應決策。\n\n**此種快速變遷的政治經濟與科技環境，導致了各國政治的民粹化發展。因為人民對於民主治理的期待是「應該對政策有決定權」，在全球化經濟與快速環境變遷下，容易演變成反動式的無視國際局勢；選擇退縮回國內政治，方能感覺到自己有決定權。**\n\n以英國脫歐運動為例，脫歐派的口號就是「奪回主控權」（Take Back Control），此訴求擊中了徬徨的民心，認為民主（包括公投）就是為了奪回國家與人民的自我決定權。同樣地，美國在該年由川普獲選為總統，也是反映了美國人民的同一心理，並反映出數位經濟快速變遷下人民的另一種心理狀態：抗拒改變。這亦是民粹政治興起的根源。\n\n為何說資料治理與這樣的政治心理，有潛在衝突呢？**資料治理，是各國政府面對快速變化而複雜的國際局勢的必要工具。亦即，公共政策的問題界定、解決方案評估、實際效果評估等，都要有資料作為依據，進而可修正、執行政策。**\n\n但資料過於龐大，不僅政府部門無法掌握資料全貌，更遑論政府以外的人員；連民選官員及監督政府的媒體，也無法掌握政府決策的全面資料依據，因此成為某種「黑箱決策」的象徵。\n\n試想，將來若因為資料過於龐大，決策環境過於複雜，有些公共決策將能以大數據模型，或人工智慧系統自行分析並做成決策——這可能比公務員自行分析判斷龐大資料更有效率，不致延誤決策時機。然而，這樣的**機器學習式或大數據自動決策模式，也更接近黑箱決策、背離了民主治理原則**——因為，連決策分析了哪些資料，都難以對外說明。\n\n如此一來，這意味著政治事務不再是政策路線辯論的結果，而是客觀的資料分析結果，而且是由演算法分析。\n\n然而，在民主國家中，社會必定要求政策需以民意為基礎，而民意將可能被少數政客以極度簡化的問題與解方來操作。因為，這種簡單的問題與答案模式，最能讓民眾感覺到「奪回主控權」，也最能呼應抗拒改變的社會心理。\n\n換言之，**當民主政治的過程，難以消化複雜的資料分析時，政治路線的極端化將難以避免。**\n\n# 建立資料存取制度，促進取用與分析\n\n不過，此一難解問題並非全然無解。**解決之道，是資料治理與民主治理兩端都須再設法深化。**\n\n首先是資料治理，在實際運作上仍資料不夠完整，許多資料壟斷於特定業者。無論傳統業者或數位平台，皆握有大量資料不願釋出；資料被當成個別企業資產，個人資料則被預設為當事人自己的資產，極不利於創造資料的公共性價值。\n\n目前，只有中國這樣的極權國家能輕易將各種資料囊括於政府手中，藉此進行經濟宏觀調控與社會微觀監控。\n\n民主法治國家無法採用此種資料治理模式，但仍應**設法建立開放的資料存取制度（open access），促進資料公共性，如此才能建立民眾對公共決策的信心。資料透明可供各方取用，對資料的分析詮釋才有多元意見的可能。**\n\n另一方面，**在民主治理端，我們必須嚴格檢視政客的訴求是否有資料為依據，也必須理解民眾對主控權的期待，避免資料治理成為菁英官僚政治的化身。** 同時，要正視民眾面臨快速變化環境的不安，儘早提出讓民眾適應新時代環境的政策，並強化社會互助安全網，這才是台灣標榜數位轉型所真正該面對的挑戰。\n\n因為，「數位轉型」一詞，預示了迎向更大程度的變動風險，社會心理上也將更為不安。數位轉型固不可避免，但政治支持亦不能或缺，否則將事倍功半，甚至衍生極端化的政治效應，不可不慎。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Democracy/%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E5%BC%8F%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E8%88%87%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Innovation），即**每個人的創新奠基在已有的成果上，但不受著作權、專利權或市場商標等影響，可以自己做出更好的版本，也能因地制宜**。\n\n於是每個人都可能提出或創造更好的作法，像LINE掃碼功能推出後，用疾管家掃碼的人就少很多了，因為較不方便。又如簡訊實聯制，除APP的使用外，亦可使用紙本。有人甚至發展出概連續章等方法，比掃碼還快。要求所有人用手機、下載APP，是極不現實的。\n\n舊系統不會讓新的沒辦法發生，而新的發生時又不會經過各種限制、讓更新的沒辦法發生——這就是開放式創新的好處。\n\n---\n\n# 不同層級的公民參與\n\n每個人都有自己的事要做，也不必在這裡花上全部時間；重點是，我們能不能在事情發生時，在這裡集結願意貢獻心力的人。像維基百科有很多人看，但真正會編輯的人沒那麽多；但是，當你知道有維基百科，需要查資料、做作業時，就可以運用。\n\n最後這會像一個緩坡，你有兩、三分鐘可以投入，那就可以聽未來城市的Podcast，大概知道有這麽一回事；等到你有20分鐘，也許你可以看共筆，順便打幾個字、改幾個錯字；你有兩個小時、兩天、兩個月的時間時，都各自有不同的事可以做。\n\n**任何人都可以投入，因為每個人都是公共服務的利害關係人，只要他有時間，就可以投入。**\n\n其實，公務員下班就是公民，甚至是鄉民。他下班後也可以去PTT提出政府改革訴求，或藉此改善公務員基本工作權益。又像是報稅軟體的改造討論，許多幫忙主持討論、連署的也不一定是財政部公務員，可能是海巡署的人——因為每個人都要報稅，他也能從民眾角度思考。\n\n所以我的意思是，**讓公務員覺得自己是公民參與的公民，而不是被參與的公務員**——過去五年多的培力，大部分公務員都了解這項好處，這也是值得繼續推動的原因。\n\n---\n\n# 開放政府平台\n\n「[公共政策網路參與平台](https://join.gov.tw/)」網站包含想要政策提議、附議、政府法規預告等，都能隨時提供意見，若提案獲得超過5,000票，我們就必須處理。全台2,300多萬人，但這網站到今年十月已經超過3,000萬瀏覽人次了，所以滿多人至少來看過一次。\n\n其實，現在平台上超過1/4的提案，都是不到18歲的人提的——等於他還沒有選舉或公投的投票權，但已經能設定國家方向。\n\n---\n\n# 資安、假訊息的威脅\n\n越開放，假訊息就越難流傳。\n\n例如，大家都知道指揮中心在每天下午兩點會發布圖卡、製作帶狀節目、讓大家問到飽；假訊息還來不及流傳，在隔天下午兩點就會受到澄清。這有點像是，若你有一位好朋友，每天問好、看到彼此、下午兩點也會視訊一下，你較不會信任有關於他的謠言，假消息較無滋長空間；但他若60天才回一次訊息，只回八股文，你就更容易相信謠言。\n\n**台灣因應假消息的方式，不是建立在「下架」，而是讓更多人看到補充資訊，透過LINE、真的假的、防詐達人等工具，且很多人參與。** 雖然還是有很多假消息，但假消息的疫苗或解藥問世的時間也越來越快。換句話說，我們已有一個生態圈——不論何時，正在炎上的假消息就那一兩個，我們的力氣花在這一兩個上面就可以了。\n\n---\n\n# 意識形態的威脅\n\n重點還是他相信誰、誰是他的**密切接觸者**對吧？所以當你想跟長輩溝通，當然不是派一隻機器人去溝通。像我自己，我一定每週回淡水找阿嬤、爸媽視訊；當他們看到很多群組、想知道更多脈絡時，就能隨時問我。假以時日，他們會發現假消息背後目的，腦裡也會形成抗體，這是最重要的。\n\n所以，**我們不是不讓假消息流通，而是讓大家瞭解它的脈絡，而且要「notice and public notice」**——知道這件事後，也讓大家知道這件事情，這是最重要的。\n\n---\n\n\n# 數位發展部\n\n過去，在實體世界可以依照發生地的管轄權處理；但數位世界必須跟不同時區、空間、社會常規的人互動，光是發一則訊息，發送、存放、接收就可能是三個不同的管轄權。所以，很多國家就發現，原本對內的準則，轉移到數位世界往往要檢討。\n\n**跨國的常規該如何討論出網路世界的常規，變成大家雖不滿意、但可接受的事情**，就是各國的數位部長、數位大使的討論工作之一。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Democracy/Why-Socrates-Hated-Democracy":{"title":"","content":"tags:

If you become rapidly oriented around maintaining that paradigm, that way of looking at the world, then you'll get to something like this and just accept it. I've seen plenty of examples of that since then, when I've shown both extremes neoclassical at one extreme, Marxist's at the other. I've shown them logical flaws in their arguments, either developed by me or developed by other 06:30people and they'll just throw their hands out. Oh, it doesn't matter. We can assume our way around that problem. Steve Keen: This is really a human flaw. You become wedded to the way in which you view the world, more than the world itself. When you face a contradiction between it, for most people, they'll turn their eyes from the contradiction.

This goes right back to Alfred Marshall back in the 1800s and early 1900s. It's a vision of economy as a self equilibrating system, which will, given left alone to its own devices, it will reach a situation where producers and consumers become as well off as they can be, subject to the constraints of their own income, where people earn their 08:00marginal product and under therefore paid fairly. It's a vision of an equilibrium system, which disturbed from equilibrium will return to that equilibrium. It's sees capitalist society as a means to maximize people's welfare, subject to the constraints of their income, which as I've said, is fairly distributed. That's the vision. When you look at it from this point, from a political science point of view, it's a vision of a self-managing, anarchist society.

Steve Keen: Well, I might actually go back to micro to start to answer that question, because these days macroeconomics has become applied micro. 09:30Dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium models and real business cycle models, which are the ones that dominate, the former much more so than the latter, dominate how neoclassical economists think about the economy today. They are all models which are derived from the idea that you should be able to start from the concept of a utility maximizing individual and a profit maximizing firm, and derive your macroeconomics from all the optimization behaviors that are supposed to rule, both consumers, and producers at the micro level. 10:00They will often reason as if the entire economy is a single, utility maximizing individual who works in the factory that he owns for a wage rate set by his marginal products and invests for an indefinite future for an infinitely long lived dynasty. Again, that's a caricature, but that is, again, a summary of what you can find, is the way they think. Their macro is applied micro. The problem is all the micro is wrong.

We can't just parse everything of value in the human experience into utility and assume that it will somehow be Pareto optimal, because utility in our current economy is another deep dish pizza for a 400 pound person, plus a six pack of beer. Whereas, other people in Africa and other places are starving, number one. Number two is we are not self interested. 11:00We are, to an extent, but we're very other regarding. When you smile at a baby human, the baby human will smile back at you. We deeply evolved in a tribal, group setting. How we care about others is not part of the equations.

This is the point that I emphasize in my debunking economics. I'll start from the point, which will when I'm writing the third edition, it's where I'll start. 11:30That's the theory of supply. Because in the theory of supply, which it says, given a certain price, how many units will be provided to the market by the firms, in an industry. Again, that's supposed to be set by profit maximizing behavior by the individual firms. What they're supposed to experience, according to the theory, is as they increase output, they are buying factor inputs, labor, and capital at the same price. But they've got a fixed number of machines, are adding more and more labor to those machines, and each new worker adds more output, but at a lesser amount than the previous worker. 12:00Steve Keen: What that means is you're paying a constant wage, you are getting less productivity per person out of each additional worker you hire so you have diminishing marginal productivity. What that translates to is rising, marginal cost. That is the foundation of the supply curve. Now, every empirical survey that has ever been done, of the actual cost structures of actual firms, finds their marginal costs are falling. 12:30Constant or falling. The very last time that was done on a grand scale was actually by leading conservative economist Alan Blinder, who has been deputy president of the America Economic Association, he's been a vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, so absolutely impeccable orthodox credentials. Steve Keen: He did a survey, what he called, asking about prices, where he surveyed when he did the numbers, 15% of America's manufacturing sector. That's a pretty good survey. His conclusion was, and I'll quote from his book, \"The overwhelmingly bad news here (for 13:00economic theory) is that the vast majority of the manufacturing goods are produced under conditions of falling marginal cost.\" Now, what does his textbook say? This guy wrote a textbook 15 years later, he talks about diminishing marginal productivity and rising marginal costs and completely ignores his own research. The reason is, if you have falling marginal cost, then marginal cost is below average cost and therefore, there is no segment of the supply marginal cost curve above average 13:30cost, which is called the supply curve. The very foundation of the theory empirically falls. You'd find the same thing in demand. Everything about the theory is unsound. ([Time 0:11:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed54913c88c200092a8dfe))\n  \n- \u003e it implies, first of all, they don't maximize profit by equating marginal cost and marginal revenue, which is the litany 14:00they get toward in first year microeconomics. Because if they do, their price will be below average cost and they'll lose money. What firms actually do, rather than choosing a profit maximizing output level, they try to flog as many units as they can, because in a competitive industry, the more units you sell, the more profit you make. Your average costs are falling as your output level rises. This is an explanation for large firms evolving and for the competitive behavior of firms, where they always try to sell as many units as they can. 14:30Steve Keen: If the neoclassicals were right, the main job of a marketing manager would be to sell stuff. Stop selling. We've reached the point where marginal cost exceeds the marginal revenue. Okay? Now, no sales manager who says, \"Stop producing output and stop selling,\" would keep his job for a nanosecond in American capitalism, because it's a completely false guise as to how you actually maximize profits. You maximize profits by selling as many units as you can. Steve Keen: The behavior of firms is different. 15:00It can't be doing this equilibrating of marginal utility against marginal costs that can't comply. The demand curve can't be derived. The market demand curve doesn't exist in the shape that they draw in the textbooks. That's been proved by logical arguments by near classical economists. The whole thing is a belief system, which has undermined itself using mathematics and empirical research, but they continue pumping it out there because it's a vision to them of the perfect society.

What you'll get is you'll get a dominant firm in the industry. Then that sets up a target for other firms to move into that industry.

([Time 0:17:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed566c1673db00098c072f))\n- \u003e If you go back 40 years, economists used to use what they call computable general equilibrium models at their core, they had an input output matrix. As part of the input-output matrix, you had the other industrial sectors, which were inputs to your own industrial sector. You also had raw materials turning up there. So before the so-called rational expectations revolution, there was a tendency to see equilibrium 19:00as being the result today of the interaction of numerous input-output dynamics and markups and product prices to give you an equilibrium at a point in time. Steve Keen: Then what they went through is this, what they call, intertemporal equilibrium. What took over there were Cobb–Douglas production functions and what they call constant elasticity of substitution production functions. The Cobb–Douglas is the pure form of it, where there's a high substitutability. 19:30That says that output is technology, which they use the symbol A for, times labor, times capital where labor and capital are both raised to powers, so that if you double all imports, all labor and all capital, you'll double output. In its own way, that's a reasonable, that's a reasonable assumption. Okay? But the exponents for labor and capital are derived from marginal productivity theory, which says that the wage of the worker is the marginal product of labor and the rate of profit on capital is the marginal product of capital. 20:00So that your values for those exponents reflect the wage, the income share of workers into the GDP and the income share in capital. The share for labor tends to be 0.7. The share for capital tends to be 0.3. That's just the arbitrary numbers they've stuck with from what income distribution was roughly in the sixties. Steve Keen: Now, there's no role for energy there. When they tack in energy, what they'll do is add it onto another factor. They say, \"Well, all the exponents still have to sum to 1. 20:30The contribution of energy is about three or 4% of GDP, so the exponent of energy is 0.03 or 0.04.\" There's a brand new paper actually by Rudy Bachmann and a few others, it's a working paper, but what it does is apply neoclassical theory to say what would happen to Germany if Russian embargo and energy, reduced energy input by 10%. Now, according to standard Cobb–Douglas production theory, a 10% fall in the energy 21:00input to German industry would reduce German GDP by 0.4%. When they use the high substitution, they'll say it might reduce it by 2%, but in other words energy is pretty irrelevant. Steve Keen: My contribution on this theory was just the simple insight, labor without energy is a corpse. Capital with that energy is a sculpture. Energy is not an independent factor of production that you throw into a factor with labor and capital. Energy is an input to labor and an input to capital, without which they can do no work. 21:30When you do that, just at the very simple level, even using the same exponents they do, the exponent for energy is 10 times the exponent they use rather than being 0.03 it's 0.3. The same of capital. Energy is much more significant than they realize. Then when you try to look at the empirical data, you find that in fact, the relationship between energy and GDP, or change in energy and change in GDP, is one for one. If there's a 10% fall in energy, there will be a 10% fall in GDP. 22:00Their theory trivializes the importance of the major factor of production, which is energy. ([Time 0:18:41](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed570f1673db00098c0730))\n- \u003e You, and I think the factor relationship of energy to GDP is 0.99 or 1, whereas a neoclassical economist would think it's 0.03 or 0.04. 23:00These are two worldviews with a planet with 8 billion people, CO2 420 parts per million, collapsing ecosystems, no plan for the future, other than continued economic growth. I think it's a pretty major assumption differential between those two world views. ([Time 0:22:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed57f01673db00098c0731))\n- \u003e When you look at the amount of energy you and I consume, it's enormous compared to what a Roman slave would consume. But the amount of our energy we actually put into manufacturing is trivial. Whereas, of course, back in the Roman slaves day, virtually all the energy they got in was the output they'd have to provide to the slave owner. That's about a hundred Watts per person, but machinery gone up radically. 24:00That, of course is where our productivity has come from, the increased amount of energy harnessed per machine over time, but of course that means waste. Steve Keen: If we had that framework, we would never allow the level of energy consumption to reach the level it is, because with the level of waste production, we'd also be acknowledging that. Of course, that's again, absent from mainstreaming thinking. ([Time 0:23:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed58424e937a000997b8d4))\n- \u003e Any sixth grader or ninth grader or 12th grader or college student could be listening to this 24:30conversation and they could, in five minutes, on their own, from a credible source, find out on the internet that a barrel of oil is 5.7 million British thermal units worth of energy potential. If you translate that to work, 1,760 kilowatt hours of work. Where you and I, digging ditches or hauling manure, or building a house generate around 25:000.6 kilowatt hours worth of energy in a day. Meaning without any conversion factors, a barrel of oil is 11 years worth of work potential. If you handicap it, because humans are more efficient at directing their energy, it's four or five years of work. Yet, we pay a hundred dollars for it and the average laborer in the United States makes $50,000 a year, yet we're generating four or five years of that person's physical labor 25:30from this barrel of oil that all we do is pay for the cost of extraction, not the cost of creation, nor the pollution. How does an economist not see and understand what I just said? Steve Keen: Because they have a nonphysical view of the economy. It's all stuff you can write on a whiteboard when you have terms, labor and capital and ... But energy's not one of the terms they even look at. It's a mindset that I trace right back to Adam Smith, in fact. 26:00Because if you go before Smith, you'll find you had the physiocrats. The physiocrats, Quesnay, Cantillon, there's quite a few others, they argue that all wealth comes from the soil, but what they fundamentally meant was all wealth comes from the sun. If you imagine you're at the Aquacultural Society of France, which was the main location that developed the physiocratic theory, you plant one, one seed corn, you get a thousand 26:30pieces of corn back and if you simply sit there and watch it'll happen over time, even if you barely do anything with the soil. Steve Keen: This became obvious to them that what was causing the wealth in human societies, what they literally call the free gift of nature. Now, in that sense, the free gift of nature that predates the understanding we have at the laws of the conservation of energy. They're aware of it. They're saying, \"We're simply exploiting energy we find in the universe, turning it into useful work.\" Then along comes Smith and says, \"Oh ... \" Living in Scotland, industrial, hardly agricultural 27:00Scotland, he couldn't accept that land was the source of value. He said, \"Labor is the source of value.\" You then had the classical school of thought coming along. Steve Keen: Now Marx then took over and said labor is the only source of value. Therefore, labor should get the entire rate of profit. The neoclassicals come along and say, \"No, both labor and capital contribute to output. Labor gets its marginal product and capital gets its marginal product and that's all just.\" 27:30We've wasted 250 years arguing about the wrong stuff. The physiocrats rights were right. We only have an advanced economy because we exploit free energy and all we're paying is the cost of extraction and therefore those enormous differentials you mentioned earlier come about.

Please tell me what happened.

When Marx turned the classical school, the labor theory of value against capitalism, then in the 1870s, that was when neoclassical economics, which came out, which said, \"No, it's the marginal productivity that determines the income, both factors of production, labor, 29:00and capital get what they deserve.\" The whole thing was seen well, productivity is coming out of three elements; labor, capital, and technology. When they tried to then quantify that, and this is probably in the 1950s and sixties with Robert Solow, they have what they called the Solow residual, that when they look how change in GDP comes about, it had very little relationship with change in labor or change in capital, but what came is change in technology. This A term which was undifferentiated became the magic source that enabled growth to occur 29:30over time. When you asked economists about it they say that's human ingenuity. Yes, there is ingenuity there, but if it wasn't fossil fuels to harness, we wouldn't be producing this volume of output. ([Time 0:28:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed59bdde2e040009f7f898))\n- \u003e what the economist call the technology component is actually 31:00the exergy, the energy useful work done by the representative machine of a particular time. Steve Keen: If you go back to James Watson's steam engine, then the energy was coal. It was about nine tons a day was consumed by the average machine, about 30% efficiency. You've fast forward to today, it's 10 tons of kerosene per second, passing through a Falcon nine and the efficiency's a bit higher, maybe about 0.4, 0.45, but fundamentally that 31:30technology term can be reseen as the useful energy derived from a machine. That's where our wealth has come from. ([Time 0:30:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed5a472637480009fc284e))\n- \u003e technology is a vector for more energy use, and we do improve and innovate, but it's all predicated on a growing amount of energy and a cheap amount of energy. ([Time 0:31:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed5a72de2e040009f7f899))\n- \u003e What would a model that uses a biophysical underpinning look like on the energy and climate aspects, from your perspective? 39:00Steve Keen: Well, the first thing is that you have to have energy and matter as and input to the production system. If you don't have energy and matter going in, you don't have goods coming out the other end. You therefore have both physical constraints, the energy has to be available, the energy return and energy investment has to be enough for you to actually get a net energy boost out of your mining of energy. You necessarily generate waste out of the production. Waste gets put back into the biosphere and then will undermine the productivity of the biosphere. 39:30That's the basic starting point. I've done the mathematics for that, with working with Matheus Grasselli and Tim Garrett. We've done a set of models of a pure energy economy and then energy plus matter economy to show those interrelationships. That's actually your very starting point. There's no output without biophysical input. Energy is absolutely crucial, is the input without which nothing else happens. That would be the starting point. And then from that framework, you would never have let level of energy usage reach the scale 40:00that it is today. ([Time 0:38:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed5c0c7b8f680009d4e609))\n- \u003e I think there's two things we need to do. One is to realize that the limits to growth was actually correct. If you've seen the work by Graham Turner in Australia, two papers that he's put together 41:00on how well the model fits time. There's Gaya Herrington, who's done work working with one of the major consulting firms. They've both shown that the business as usual or BAE2, which is where you had twice as many resources, or the other one with the technology, those three of the seven runs that they did for the limits to growth study, we are somewhere in the ballpark of all of those, which means a breakdown driven by either excessive pollution, which is the carbon dioxide sort of things or running out of raw materials, which is the declining of energy return on energy investment, 41:30which we're also seeing. That's realistic. Steve Keen: What we're getting out of the climate side is just saying a lot of the potential tipping points that they saw coming forward, are coming forward much more rapidly than they thought. We're losing the Arctic. It's fairly accepted we're not going to have a white Arctic in summer by 2030 or 2040, sometime in that range. All the scientists are saying, \"Do not exceed two degrees. Whatever you do for God's sake, don't let the temperature go past two, because at that 42:00point, the tipping points that we know will cause catastrophic change. The climate will be triggered and we'll have forces far beyond what we can deal with.\" We should be saying to economists, \"Okay. Tell us how to finance the sort of very, very immediate attenuation, mitigation change in energy source proposals we need to prevent exceeding 2°C and then tell us what the resource implications are. If we do want to go from a internal combustion engine world to a electric vehicle world, 42:30do we have the resources for it?\" Steve Keen: No mainstream economist can answer either of those questions because mainstream economics has ignored the how money is created and live with a toy model of money creation. So they're useless on the issue of government finance and because they've got this non-bio physical model that dominates how they think today, at the heart of all these dynamics, sarcastic general remodels is normally a Cobb-Douglas production function, not something that includes 43:00input-output dynamics and physical inputs and so on. They're useless there too. We've really got to kick them out and ask the heterodox economists and some of the engineers, those questions. That's more important than a new economic model. ([Time 0:40:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed5c992637480009fc2851))\n- \u003e One is that genuine sciences are aware of the limitations of their own knowledge when applied to another field. If you have engineers, they're not about to jump in and tell a chemist how to concoct chemicals in the laboratory or biologists and so on. So there's a level of professional respect for another theory, which means that genuine 44:00scientists don't go and look at economic theory, because they think, \"Well, there's things economists know that I don't know. They'll make choices that I can't understand. I'd be an amateur so I keep out of that.\" Then what it sells to the world is a beautiful vision of capitalism. Steve Keen: Now, it's a completely inappropriate vision of capitalism because if you, as a proverbial alien coming in and taking a look at our society, if you had an alien flying past the planet and taking a good look at capitalism, the last word they'd use to describe it is equilibrium. 44:30It's far from equilibrium. It's changing all the time compared to any other social system. What we've seen is a radical change in the means of production and a radical change in the nature of social relations over time, as well. So far from being an equilibrium dominated society, we're a change dominated society. It's the wrong picture of how our society functions, but what it implies is a perfect world. Steve Keen: If only we can get rid of trade unions, monopolies, 45:00and government, the free market, get rid of all those non-market interventions the market system will reach equilibrium, where we produce the right amount of everything compared to what people's tastes are, where people's maximize their utility subject to their income and where their income is gained by their worthwhile contributions to society, as measured by the marginal product of their social class. It's a vision of harmony. Humans seem incredibly biased towards imagining a perfect world. 45:30Religions talk about a nirvana or a heaven, et cetera, et cetera, neoclassical economists talk about equilibrium now. It's heaven on earth. That is a incredibly seductive vision for our crazy species. ([Time 0:43:41](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed5d14de2e040009f7f89d))\n- \u003e Credit is change in debt, change in private 52:30debt. Okay? If you look at debt, that's how many dollars you owe. Your credit is how many new dollars you borrow each year. Okay? Mainstream economics ignores that on the basis of what they call the loanable funds model, which says that banks are simply intermediaries between savers and borrowers. If Nate is a saver and Steve is a borrower, then Nate lends to Steve, Nate's spending power goes down, Steve's spending power goes up, one cancels out the other, unless I'm a much more propagate spender than you are. 53:00It all comes down to differing margin propensity to consume. That is the model that they stick with, despite the Bank of England saying back in 2014, \"That's not how banks work. Banks are not intermediaries. They're money originators. They create money by creating debt at the same time.\" Steve Keen: Nate's out of the picture. Steve goes to the bank because he wants to buy a house in Bangkok, borrows a million dollars from a bank. The bank says here's a million dollars to hand over to the owner. You also owe us a million dollars on which we're going to charge you interest. 53:30Okay? But that million dollars is spent by the borrower and becomes part of aggregate demand and aggregate income. Now, I'm using an example of buying a property, but if I shouted you coffee when you were in Amsterdam and I swipe my credit card, then what happens is €7, let's say €10 money is created, which is spent. It's expenditure by me. It's income by the coffee shop owner. The level of debt goes up by €10, which is the increase in my credit card debt. 54:00Steve Keen: The change in debt is literally a one for one contribution to demand right now. Of course, credit can be positive or negative. If you have rising debt, credit is positive and adding to demand. But if you have falling debt, credit is negative and subtracting from demand. That's what caused the financial crisis. That's number one. ([Time 0:52:29](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed5f12f88ccb000982de28))\n- \u003e I say that credit allows us to consume things we, otherwise, wouldn't have been able to afford to consume and produce things we couldn't have afforded to produce. 55:00We will continue to grow our economy as long as we issue credit in sufficient amounts that we grow our energy. But at some point, this decade, in my opinion, either the financial markets themselves will say, \"No más.\" We won't be able to grow credit. Queue what's happening in Japan right now with JGBs. At some point, the financial markets are going to pull a George Soros versus the Bank of England and say, \"Interest rates are going to go up, we can't continue to borrow. 55:30This is untenable.\" But so far they have taken the neoclassical economist route of all's good, let's continue. It's a belief system. It could last another decade. I don't know. Nate Hagens: But the other side of it is the oil depletion side. If we have Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United States, if that whole thing, A geopolitically changes or B the underlying decline rate of oil in the world is 7%. 56:00We are offsetting that by infill drilling and drilling tertiary wells and drilling new wells, but eventually depletion will win. We're still going to have plenty of oil. From a climate perspective, we could argue we'll have too much oil, but we won't have a hundred million barrels a day at $50, $60 the way that our system has been built on. So I see this divergence growing. ([Time 0:54:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed5fd87b8f680009d4e60a))\n- \u003e We are running out of easily available energy. The cost of getting energy out of the ground is rising in energy terms. The energy return in energy invested is becoming a serious issue. At the same time, and this is work that's been done by another Australian engineer called Simon Michaux. What we've had is a declining energy return and increasing need for energy to process 57:00minerals, which are lower grade than they were back in the days of cheap oil. That's one of, and cheap coal, that's one of Simon's main points. Putting that all together, we only can produce output if we've got free energy to exploit and easy minerals to mine, and because we're running out of both, we create a crunch point where suddenly that just is not available anymore and then it will not be profitable. Steve Keen: The cost of production are going to rise radically. That'll turn up as inflation in the real world. That's what's happening right now to some large degree, but it's not inflation driven 57:30by wage demands or by profit markups. It's driven by the simply it's costing more and more to actually turn those raw materials and energy into finish goods. That's going to squeeze all the margins, which enable us to have the surplus we live on, workers and capitalists, is that gap between the energy input we need to put in and what we get back out of it, but that squeezes so do living standards. ([Time 0:56:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed6023de2e040009f7f89e))\n- \u003e if you impose the cost of that on the poor, then you're going to have the gilets jaunes times 10 happening globally because poor people are already finding they can't afford to heat their houses. They've got a choice. Do I heat the house or do I send my kid to school? When you start facing those sorts of choices and then make it even worse than that, you're going to get a revolt of the poor. Poor are the bottom 60 or 70% of population quite feasibly. So the only way this is sustainable is if the cost of adjustment are put on the rich, and that is not exactly how capitalism has functioned. ([Time 1:00:11](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed60c57b8f680009d4e60b))\n- \u003e I think we have to find ourselves rationing resources. Effectively, we are in a war. We don't realize that. We're in a war, we are losing, because we're fighting an unbeatable foe, which is the climate of the planet itself. The only way to adjust is that we've got to radically pull ourselves back and stop put pressuring on the climate. Therefore, the only way that can be done without causing complete social breakdown is A, most of the money that enables that is government created, not private debt, because there's no way to profit out of this overall. So the government money creation has to take over and we have to see it as effectively we're rationing resources so that the poor get enough to survive. The rich, get enough to be slightly more affluent than the poor, but the wealth levels and consumption levels they're used to just have to be a thing of the past. ([Time 1:01:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed61154fecc70009a2eb00))\n- \u003e I'm working on a proposal for a parallel currency system. The idea would be that you would have the normal monetary economy you have right now, but everything would have two prices; a money price, and a carbon price. The carbon price, reflecting the actual carbon content of the good you are purchasing. We'd all get a tradeable carbon credit on a daily basis from the treasury or central bank. We'd have to spend both amounts. Now, of course, because of the skewed nature of the distribution of income, if you gave it out at the average for an economy right now, I wouldn't even bother trying to at the global level, but that's how you ... Global agreements are the way you manage to prevent things being done, they don't actually occur. But do it at the national level so each economy gets ... Steve Keen: Each person, in say America, gets the average carbon credit for America. 95% of Americans would not reach that level of consumption, but the top 5% would. They would need to buy carbon credits off the poor to continue to buy what they're buying. That would be a way of putting enormous pressure to reduce carbon content and a redistribution for the poor, in that sense, through a market mechanism. Whatever we do, it has to provide more of a level of saying ... We have to provide a minimum level of income, a standard living for the vast majority of people, and then the rich have to drop radically. Your idea, taxing everything else, not taxing labor that ends up meaning that the worker gets to keep a hundred percent of what their wage is. That gives them more buying power, anybody buying more extravagant goods, they face the larger cost. Overall, we have to find something where the burden is put on the rich, not the poor.

Steve Keen: I think we could, but we have to realize we need be effectively a community of elders, society of experts, making these decisions guided by system software that enables their views to be brought together. That's the vision that I have that I have, which would be functional. You don't want people getting there, because they're narcissists and they can say, \"I can lead you to the promised land.\" We need people who are aware of the complexity of the world in which we live.

I expect to see an enormous number of deaths in the next 80 years, both of humans and other life forms. I see that basically as pretty much inevitable. What I want to have is some capacity to sustain what we've learned through the fossil fuel period. If there's some way that knowledge can be hung onto, then there's a chance for us to build a sustainable, life respecting, civilization on the other side of the catastrophe that I expect us to go through. It would be the greatest tragedy of all, to have learned as much as we know about the universe and then destroy our own society, which enables us to put that knowledge into practice. I care about maintaining that knowledge more than anything else. ([Time 1:12:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ed51b17ffd5400098a9ec5?annotationId=62ed635ede2e040009f7f8a1))\n- \u003e Nate Hagens: Yeah. What are you specifically most personally concerned about in the coming 10 years or so in the world? Steve Keen: Climate breakdown causing social breakdown, because if we have climate catastrophes, meaning food production collapses, for example, which is potentially ... The Ukraine wars accelerated that in Europe right now. The drought in the western United States, if that extends, of course, to all sides of the wheat belt, then we could have a collapse in food output and therefore, we get a choice of high prices causing starvation, or we go into rationing. Now that could lead, and particularly in as a divisive a society as America, that could lead to just social conflict. The law of the gun comes out as to who gets to eat or attempts to. Of course that would destroy your production and distribution system as well. Steve Keen: I'm worried about the climate breakdown leading to a social breakdown, ending up in a mad max world. In that case, I actually think the most sustainable societies are ones with a more cohesive social system, but also more acceptance of authoritarian control. Because if the Chinese tell the Chinese people, \"You've got to ration food,\" and it applies to everybody and it seemed to apply to everybody, they'll accept it. You tell Americans to ration food, they reach for their revolver.

#🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: \nhttps://youtu.be/1XGiTDWfdpM\n\n---\n\n\u003e what is economics or maybe what is or should be the goal of economics well it should be understand 02:00how human civilization comes about and how it can be maintained and that's not what it's been at all so we have a discipline which has the right name and the wrong soul\n\n\n\u003e what is the soul of economics the soul of economics really is to explain how do we manage to build a civilization that elevates us so far above the energy and consumption and knowledge levels of the base environment of the earth 02:30because if you think about and this is actually working from work i've learned from tim garrett who's one of my research colleagues as an atmospheric physicist and his idea is that we have these we exploit these high-grade energy sources from the sun itself to coal nuclear et cetera et cetera which means we can maintain a level of human civilization well above what we'd have if we're just still running around with rocks and stones and spears so it's that elevation above the base level of the planet which is human 03:00civilization and if we didn't have this energy we were exploiting if we didn't use the environment to elevate ourselves above what's possible in the background then you and i wouldn't be talking into microphones you know yeah we might be doing drum beats and stuff like this but we wouldn't be having the sort of conversation we have so it explained how they came about that what's the economics should be doing and it's not\n\n\n\u003e we're the most elaborate construction on the planet and like 03:30that's not what we've done we've denigrated the planet itself we don't have respect for the fact that life itself is an incredible creation and i i my ultimate if i had to see how humanity is going to survive what we're putting ourselves through then it would we'd have to come out of it as a species which sees its role as preserving and respecting life\n\n\n\u003e life is incredible and when humans don't respect it enough we trash it and and that's what economics i think has played a huge role in that so i actually regard my discipline i would never call it a profession let alone a science uh my discipline has probably helped bring about the termination potential the feasible termination of human civilization\n\n\n\u003e practically speaking what are the goals of economics well in terms of the tools we use we should be using the tools that engineers use frankly and that's which sounds ridiculously simple because you would expect that economists are using 05:00up-to-date techniques that are common in other sciences where you're dealing with similar ideas of stocks and flows and interactions between the environment and a system and so on and that's fundamentally systems engineering and that's what we should be using as the tools of economics\n\n\n\u003e i actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago 09:30that's where i'd like to start from and they're called the physiocrats and the name itself implies where their knowledge came from because if you go back far enough in history we didn't we didn't do autopsies but when you started doing autopsies they found wires they found tubes etc etc and they started seeing the body as a circulation system and they applied the same sort of logic to the economy and they became out of an agricultural economy which was france and they saw that the wealth came 10:00effectively from the sun so they saw all wealth comes from they said the soil but what they really mean is sun the soil absorbs the energy of the sun one seed plants a thousand flu seeds come back there is no surplus uh we are simply mining what we can find out of the natural economy that's where we should have stayed and developed from that forward\n\n\n\u003e we then went through the classical school of economics which comes out of adam smith and smith uh coming from scotland looked at what the physiocrats said and 10:30what the physiocrats argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth and the manufacturing sector is sterile that's literally the term they use to describe the manufacturing what is their own means sterile means you don't you don't extract value you simply change the shape of value so the the value comes from the soil the only comes from the soil that's the free gift of nature that's literally the phrase they used and we then distribute the free gifts of nature around and we need carriages which was the manufacturing term they 11:00used at the time as well as wheat so we to make the carriages we take what's been taken from the soil and we convert it to a different form but there is no value added in manufacturing so smith looked at that and said well i'm from scotland and we've got these you know industries you know we make stuff and it's machinery and he said no it's not land that gives it the source of value it's labor yeah now that led to the classical school of thought and that said that all 11:30value comes from labor uh that value is uh is objective so it's the amount of effort you put in that the price two things will exchange for reflects the relative effort that's involved in the manufacturing so this computer takes two hours to make and this bottle takes two minutes to make then there's this is worth 60 times as much as that okay they didn't talk about marginal cost it was absolute cost effectively they didn't talk about utility as a subjective thing they ridiculed subjective utility theory\n\n\n\u003e marx then turned that classical school which was pro-capitalism and anti-feudal into a critique of capitalism which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a defense of capitalism 12:30but they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value so that value does not reflect effort it's the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that determines their value marginal utility it's the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility and the concepts of equilibrium and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical school and that's still the 13:00dominant school now 150 years later\n\n\n\u003e austrian economics grew out of the new 20:00out of the rebellion against the classical school so you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back in the 1870s as william jevens from england uh menger who's from austria and vol ras from france and volras tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multi-con a multi-product economy where there's numerous producers and numerous consumers everybody's both a producer 20:30and a consumer and you try to work out a vector of prices that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously and that's his equilibrium orientation jevons is also on about equilibrium but he worked more at the aggregate level so there's a supply curve in a demand curve and that's what gabe marshall ultimately codified menger was pretty much saying that well yes there might be an equilibrium but you're going to get disturbed from it all the time you'll be above or below the equilibrium and what came out of the austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that the market 21:00should reach equilibrium but then said well you'll get disturbed away from the equilibrium and it's that's what gives you the vitality of capitalism because an entrepreneur will see an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap and that will give you innovation over time and schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that entrepreneur an entrepreneur is somebody with a great idea and no money yeah okay so to become a capitalist you've got to get money and therefore you've got to approach the finance 21:30sector to get the money and the finance sector creates money and also creates a debt for the entrepreneur and so you get this financial engine turning up as well and you will get movements away from equilibrium out of that you won't necessarily head back towards the equilibrium so schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role in which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time and that is really i think a much closer 22:00vision of actual capitalism than anything by even even the the industry-leading austrians you know hayek uh et cetera et cetera they they and certainly ron barto i find totally like reading a cardboard cutout version of uh of the wealth of the wealth of nations it's uh i find his worth trivial um but sean peter was rich but with the same foundations as the austrians but because he talked about the importance of money that took him away from the 22:30austrian vision which is very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism beta said you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs and that's a very important vision\n\n\n\u003e ean payton gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector and that's fundamentally the world in which we live\n\n\n\u003e money fundamentally is not a commodity it's a it's a claim on somebody else that's money's essence so when you do it you 25:30must use double entry bookkeeping to do it and then when you do you find all the answers that come out of thinking as money as a commodity you're wrong so for example i've got elon on this one so i want to get this rid of elon because i saw him making a comment about this a few weeks ago on twitter he said that it's wrong for the government effectively it seems wrong for the government to always be in deficit okay now when you look at it and say well how is money created how does money come about when it's not a commodity like gold would you dig up out of the ground when it's actually 26:00social relations between people that create money well money is the fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector when you if we make a transfer between us your deposit account goes down my deposit account goes up those are exchanges on the liability side of the banking of the of the banking sector but if we have a transaction with a bank uh then if the bank lends us money it's as its loans go up its deposits go up 26:30again that same balance so you've got to look and say money therefore is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector so how do you create create additional liabilities you must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side and the asset side of the banking sector so if you and i make a transaction no money is created money existing money is redistributed but if you go to a bank and by taking out a bank loan then money is created by the bank loan so the liabilities of the banking sector rise the assets rise 27:00they're balanced but more liabilities means for the banking sector means more money okay so that's what that's how private banks create money\n\n\n\u003e if the government runs a deficit it spends more money on the individuals in the economy than it taxes them which means their bank accounts increase so a 27:30government deficit creates money for the private sector okay so that's where money creation occurs from the government so it's it's it puts money in people's it puts more money into people's bank accounts by spending by welfare payments than it takes out by taxation so that's creating new money and then on the other side on the bank the money turns up in the reserve accounts of the banks which are basically the private bank's bank accounts at the central bank 28:00so rather than the asset of private money creation being loans the asset of government money creation is reserves\n\n\n\u003e money creation is a good thing because money creation is what allows commerce to happen\n\n\n\u003e if you imagine um your assets minus your liabilities as your equity and your asset is somebody else's liability and your liability is somebody else's asset when we're talking about financial assets and this is another mind-blowing thing that i've just recently solved myself so the sum total of all financial assets 29:30and liabilities is zero\n\n\n\u003e you'd have a bank account and you'd have some cash yeah okay those are your assets but the bank account is a liability of the banking sector and the cash is the liability of the federal reserve okay so what what's money well money is money money is the promise of a third 31:00party that we both accept to close our transaction\n\n\n\u003e what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy so i said in a in a barter economy what we do is you know i'll give you two of these for one of those yeah okay barter just would working at a relative price there are two of us involved and there are two commodities so with money money is a triangular transaction okay 32:00there is one commodity i want to buy that can of drink off you uh two people and the price that's worked out ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay the bank that the buyer has to the promises pay the bank that the seller has so if i we so what you have is a monetary transaction in a capitalist economy involves three agents the buyer the seller and the bank so the bank always has to be part of it well the 32:30bank has to be part of it what when when i hand you the money you accept that as uh you've now got rather than it's the bank promising to pay me something it's another bank promising to pay you something and we exchange the promises of banks and that's fundamentally money\n\n\n\u003e what he does talk about is foreground and background intention and his idea of a dialectic is that there is a unity will exist in society and that unity can be an individual it can be a commodity anything at all 39:00the unity will be understood by that society one particular aspect will be focused upon so if you think about the human being in capitalism the focus on the human being as an object is their capacity to work you're a worker okay that's put in the foreground the fact that you're human and you want to play a guitar and go surfing and make love and all the other things that humans do is pushed into the background there's a tension between the two of those 39:30and that can transform that unity over time and that's a beautiful dynamic vision of change so dialectics is a philosophy of change\n\n\n\u003e if you take a human in a any preview it could go back to cro-magnon days when we're you know living in caves and yep and we've got to go hunting and cook food and stuff like that but there's no social hierarchy as we've become used to so you don't get labored as a worker or a capitalist you're just a human in that situation then you'll you've got more of an integrated view of who you are and i think that's one of the appeals of a tribal a genuine tribal culture that 40:30you get treated for the whole of who you are you've certainly categorized you're male you're female you're young you're old you're a hunter you're a you're a tool maker etc etc but you're treated as more an integrated object when you get put in a complex society like a capitalist society then one side of you is emphasized and the others are de-emphasized\n\n\n\u003e is it fair to say that the background is like our basic fundamental humanity and the foreground is the machine of capitalism effectively\n\n\n\u003e what marx did 41:00is apply this to a commodity he said what is the essential unity in a capitalist economy and the essential unity is a commodity\n\n\n\u003e unity an object in society okay okay so he started from the point of view of trying to understand what how exchange occurs how do we set prices and his starting vision was to say that a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy\n\n\n\u003e the part of the unity 41:30that we focus upon is the its exchange value a capitalist produces a commodity not because of its qualitative characteristics but because it be sold for a profit so the foreground aspect of a commodity is its exchange value the background aspect of it it won't succeed as a commodity unless it has a use value\n\n\n\u003e in a feudal society the commodity what's focused upon is the utility and the cost of production when you're when you're the emperor is immaterial capitalism reverses that so the commodity in a capitalist economy 43:30is a plastic two dollar scratcher you can get from kmart or target yeah and so the the use value is necessary but irrelevant to forming the price\n\n\n\u003e the argument in the neoclassical theory is that the price ratio the price will when there's an exchange going on there's two person two commodity exchange of two commodities for between two people uh they will cha the the price will change until such time as the ratio of the marginal utilities is equal to the ratio of the marginal costs that's supposed to be the equilibrium\n\n\n\u003e now mark says that's [ __ ] that's a previous society where you exchange 44:30stuff that you happen to have for stuff somebody else happened to have without any real production mechanism being involved and he said that's like when you when you have an eight two ancient trial or two tribes meeting for the very first time and one tribe can make something the other tribe can't make and they will therefore the price they were willing to pay will reflect how unique this other object is that the this one tribe can make and the other can't so for example the story of manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads it's actually 40 glass trading beads i 45:00do believe it is a true story but the thing is the indians couldn't make glass beads so they value the glass beads of the island of manhattan okay which is a utility-based comparison what mark said that's the very initial contact over time even if you don't know the technology over time you you start to realize how much work goes involved to making what they're selling you versus what you're selling to them and you start making stuff specifically for sale\n\n\n\u003e the utility plays no role in setting price in marx's model whereas it's essential in the neoclassical model\n\n\n\u003e utility itself has different meanings in the two schools of thought if you take the classical school of thought which when marx comes from utility is effectively objective so the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it okay not how comfortable it makes you feel yeah okay now if you think about the utility of the chairs we're both sitting and they're identical from a classical point of view we're both sitting okay 46:30but from the neoclassical point of view it's how comfortable it makes you feel and that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort you might be far more comfortable in the identical chair that i'm sitting in then i am yeah and therefore the comparison is difficult and therefore working out a ratio involves you've got a decline in your each time you give away a chair in exchange for a iphone you have a fall in your utility okay but and then therefore you want a higher return because you're losing more 47:00utility each time the more chairs you give away the less utility you're getting from chairs so there's a decline in your utility that's your your marginal utility so it's including your subjective valuation in setting the price and what mark's pointed out is this is a caricature of actual change in the capitalist economy because we have in a capitalist economy huge factories turning out huge quantities specifically for sale they've got no utility to the um seller unless they're sold\n\n\n\u003e it's a very different vision of where how prices said and marx used that to explain where profit comes from but he made a mistake and his argument was that talking about a worker uh as an ally or unity this foreground background tension thing the foreground is that you hire a worker for their cost of production and their cost of production is a subsistence wage okay 48:00the utility to the buyer is the fact that they can work in a factory now it might take six hours let's say to make the means of subsistence and that's the exchange value and that's what the capitalist pays as a wage to the worker but they can work in the factory for 12 hours that's the utility 12-6 is six surplus of value hours and that's where profit comes from and that was marx's argument and i thought it was brilliant but it also applied to machinery\n\n\n\u003e the essential unity in a capitalist economy is the commodity a commodity has two characteristics exchange value and use value okay exchange value of a commodity in a capitalist economy will be its cost of production the use value is what you do with it okay once you've purchased it\n\n\n\u003e the basic idea starts from the commodities the fundamental unity and capitalism the important commodity in marx's thinking was the worker because that's where he said profit came from yeah okay and then that explains the motivation of the capitalist and that ultimately sort of labor theory of value and marx's arguments about how capitalism will come to an end\n\n\n\u003e the labor is the only commodity 55:00with both what he called commodity and commodity power\n\n\n\u003e the commodity is you can buy labor which is the means of subsistence labor power is the capacity to work inside a factory there's a difference between the two therefore that difference will give rise to surplus and there's no other 55:30commodity that has this incidence of commodity and commodity power so that was his exclusivest argument\n\n\n\u003e the use value exchange value argument can be applied to a machine what's the exchange value of a machine it's cost of manufacturing what's its use value its capacity to produce goods for sale no relation between the two there'll be 58:00a gap a machine can be a source of profit\n\n\n\u003e the use value significantly greater than its exchange value i.e that the contribution of the machine to production exceeds its depreciation and that was an insight which undermined his explanation for revolution\n\n\n\u003e the exchange value of the commodity sets its price the use value is independent he called them incommensurable he literally would use the word incommensurability between exchange value and a use value whereas neoclassicals make them commensurable so saying exchange value and use value in incommensurable and that normally means that exchange value is objective like the number of hours it takes to make something useful is subjective how comfortable the chair is the fact you can sit in a chair so that's incommensurability but when you apply it in production the exchange value of something is objective it's how many hours it takes to make a machine or how many hours it takes to make the means of subsistence for a worker the use value is also objective you're making commodities for sale and the worker does six hours six hours of work will make them the means of subsistence for the worker but the worker will work a 12-hour day and the six hours becomes a gap now that's incommensurability between use value and exchange value of labor\n\n\n\u003e in my modern reinterpretation of marx which brings in my work on energy i see both labor and machinery as a means to harness energy and produce useful work and they can both do that in fact they do it together it's a collective enterprise\n\n\n\u003e there's no fundamental difference from exchange value and use value perspective between a human and a machine and therefore they're using the same logic they can both be a source of surplus yeah which is what marx contradicted because his explanation for where socialism would come from is that only profit comes from late profit comes only from labor over time will add more machinery than labor that will mean a falling rate of profit and therefore a tendency towards socialism and what he did in that insight in 1857 is contradict his own idea about what would lead to socialism and he couldn't cope with it\n\n\n\u003e the real foundation of marxist political philosophy was the economic argument that there would be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall and that tendency for the rate of profit of fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder paying them less than their subsistence uh i'll revolt by workers against this and then you would get socialism on the other side\n\n\n\u003e strictly speaking what socialism meant is the public ownership of the means of production no private ownership for the means of production\n\n\n\u003e that's the outcome you actually want the best possible world you're trying to build as fast as possible you're paying workers as high wages as you possibly can and that leads to a world where you don't innovate you said capitalism on the other hand pure capitalist economy you're trying to pay workers as little as possible you have competitive industries you're trying to take demand away from your rivals you have kawasaki versus honda versus you know bmw etc etc the way you get demand away from your competitors is by innovating so what you will get is cycles and booms and slumps but you'll innovate and change over time so what you found was this huge gap between socialist volume production with no innovation and capitalism with innovation so that was the fundamental failing\n\n\n\u003e the essence of capitalism is what you can make in a factory and therefore for these unique objects these rare objects and the picasso painting uh you know a beautiful bottle of wine etc etc then the utility it can't be reproduced easily so its price will be determined by subjective valuation you said what we're talking about in capitalism is the stuff you can make on mass okay and that that that is the true focus of the capitalist economy and that is not about scarcity that is about you the only scarcity applies when you don't have the resources to make them anymore or you can't use the energy involved because you'll damage the biosphere with too much which we've already done okay but fundamentally the scarcity that neoclassicals have made us think about and austrians think about as well is non-reproducible but the essence of capitalism is the commodity the back scratcher the two buck back scratcher anybody can you know the cheapest chips to make and that's why you can make a profit out of them um not not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies that only the king gets so we think our vision of scarcity has been perverted by neoclassicals analyzing the exception to capitalism and calling it capitalism\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Economics/The-Dao-of-Capital-Notes":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟨 \naliases: \nref: \n\n---\nBastiat發現，市場及人與人之間的交易應當足夠自由地進行，這也是一種高級的、追求慾望滿足的機制。即使初期存在著明顯的不平等，追求慾望的過程會出乎意料地消除這些不平等性，指向更高層次的、需要間接實現的目的——所有這些都是為了資本主義制度下的受益者，也就是消費者的利益。他在《和諧經濟論》（Economic Harmonies）中寫道：「必須引入競爭，因為需要競爭來改變不平等的事實。勞動力本能地朝著承諾其會得到最好回報的方向前進，所以最終必然會達到一個能夠享受超常優勢的結果；因此，不平等僅僅是一種對自身的鞭策，驅使我們走向平等。這便是目的論在現實社會中最好的例子之一。」\n\n社會中的人們「彼此支持，為他人工作，互利互惠，運用自身能力，抑或任憑他人支配，都是為了取得回報」。個人就像國家一樣，並不是孤立的；事實上，個體的生存取決於個體間的相互作用。\n\nBastiat認為，私人財產權能夠得到足夠尊重，社會所有成員的利益就可以和諧共存。在他看來，政府的主要作用是維護生命安全、自由和財產，以及消除不公正。\n\n按照Mises的看法，時間偏好是利率的唯一來源——等待和放棄眼前的利潤（或消費），甚至資本流失（比如通過昂貴的資本支出），是我們人性中合乎邏輯的一部份——事實上，為了做某些有益的事，我們必須克服人性的一部份（這些事情累積起來就相當於文明的進步）。\n\n……放棄直接獲利的途徑，採取較困難和迂迴的路徑，暫時的虧損是一個中間步驟，是為了將來得到更大的潛在優勢。由於這樣做非常難，因此它仍然是一條少有人選擇的迂回曲折的路。這和我們的作法如此不同，與對時間的認知反差距大。\n\n我們必須改變認知維度，從當下改為中期，從即期改為跨期。這需要一種堅定的、脫離眼前正在發生的、可見的事物的前瞻性，轉向即將到來的、現在還無法看到的事物。Mark Spitznagel稱此新的視角為「景深」（使用時間上的光學術語而不是空間的術語），我們能夠敏銳地感知更久遠的未來時間。\n\n這並不像某些人想像的那樣，是從短線思維轉向長線思維。所謂長線，不過是陳詞濫調，而且經常本身都充滿了矛盾：為了長期目的而採取行動，通常需要有一個當下的承諾，它基於可選擇的機會集合的一個短線觀點，等待在一段時間之後出現的結果——通常在這段延長期裡，人們對跨期機會缺乏充分考量或區分。（更有甚者，說一個人在按長線操作，經常是為一件事沒有按計畫發生而找的藉口。）長線是遠視，短線是近視；景深則介於這兩者之間。所以我們不必考慮長線或短線。正如克里普悖論，我們應該從完全不同的角度看待時間——跨期，其中包含了一系列的「當下」時刻，環環相扣。\n\n老子「是謂微明，柔弱勝剛強。」時間不是外生，而是內生的，是一切事物的基礎因素——而耐心是最寶貴的財富。漢學家Roger Ames和David Hall將「道」說成是「做的方法」「過程性的」（他們稱做「動詞型形容詞」），延續一段時間的「焦點認知和現場認知」，這就是景深，我們通過這個概念，探索配置、環境和系統中蘊藏的潛力。\n\n對於老子而言，大部分的外部世界都只是帶來了來自外部的分散注意力，大部分認知都是對一個隱藏的事實的發散性認知——而這其實更需要人們集中注意力。用《老子》中更準確的話說，就是「不出戶知天下；不窺牖見天道。其出彌遠，其知彌少。」\n\nPaul Carus在其1913年版的《The Canon of Reason and Virtue: Being Lao-tze's Tao Teh King》中，將老子的認識論與18世紀德國哲學家康德相提並論：「老子贊同康德的先驗學說，也就是說，某些真理可以被先驗地表述，即在我們獲得實際體驗之前。並非每個人都瞭解人類自身，但是思想家可以。為了瞭解太陽的化學成分，我們無須登上太陽；我們可以用光譜法分析陽光。我們無需用可伸縮的卷尺度量地球到月球的距離，我們可以用一種先驗科學的方法（三角學）算出來。」\n\n《老子》具備一種幾乎反實證的特點，這是一種與實證主義者對知識來自感覺認知的看法完全不同的立場。Jacob Needleman這樣看待《老子》：「我們看到的只是事物、實體、事件；我們沒有直接體會到力量和主導自然的法則。」真理可以從理解基本的自然和邏輯結構中獲得，可以從在風中彎曲的樹、從水的急遽最終淹沒了道路、從蛇與鳥的搏鬥中獲得。表象、各種感受和實證數據確實很具欺騙性，只有智慧才能從投入中獲得特定的背景聯繫和意義。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.360043098Z","tags":null},"/Research//Economics/The-Misuse-of-Mathematics-in-Economics":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Often, if you make your assump-tions in plain English, they will sound ridiculous. But if you couch them in terms of equations, integrals, and matrices, they will appear more sophisticated, and the unrealism of the assumptions may not be obvious, even to people with Ph.D.’s from places like Harvard and Stanford, or to editors at top theory journals such as Econometrica … ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmse7g5fheerpp2chfnpty5d))\n- Given the importance of signaling in all walks of life, and given the power of math, not just to illuminate and to signal, but also to trick, confuse, and bewilder, it thus makes perfect sense that roughly 99% of the core training in an economics Ph.D. is in fact in math rather than economics.

This mathematical modeling activity is considered useful and essential. To understand and explain relations between different entities in the real economy the predominant strategy is to build mathematical models and make things happen in these ‘analog-economy models’ rather than engineering things happening in real economies.

As a rule, none is given, which makes it rather puzzling how things like ‘efficient markets’ and ‘rational expectations’ have become standard modeling assumptions made in much of modern macroeconomics. The reason for this sad state of ‘modern’ economics is that economists often mistake mathematical beauty for truth.

\nhttps://youtu.be/pDi82plBOh4\n\n---\n今天，我想反思一下氣候變化，不是關於氣候變化的科學，而是關於全球變暖問題和我們的未來的不同認識階段。我不能歸類每個人都遵循同樣的順序，但這個階段的順序大致是我在自己的生活中遵循的。而且我認為嘗試解釋為什麼很多人使用氣候變化這個詞很重要，但他們的解決方案和解決方案以及他們的希望和乾預措施卻大相徑庭。\nToday, I would like to give a reflection about climate change, not about the science of climate change, but about the different stages of awareness when it comes to the issue of global warming and our future. I can't categorize that everyone follows this same sequence, but this sequence of stages is roughly what I've followed in my own life. And I think it's important to attempt to explain why lots of people use the word climate change, but their solutions and their fixes and their hopes and interventions are wildly different. \n\n所以氣候意識的七個階段。嗯，有零階段，就是人的領域和環境不是分開的。很多很多人一生都在森林裡散步上班或從湖里釣到魚，這一切似乎都是他們生活的一部分。自然世界和環境過程對人們來說是不可見的。這只是他們的一生。\nSo seven stages of climate awareness. Well, there's stage zero, which is that the human sphere and the environment are not separate. Many, many humans go through life taking that forest walk to work or getting a fish out of a lake, and it all seems like it's part of their life. The natural world and the environmental processes are invisible to people. It's just all their life. \n\n這使我們進入了第一階段，這是對人類系統嵌入在一個擁有自己的生態過程、生物、系統等的環境中的認識。我在很小的時候就知道了這一點，我的意思是有一個原因至少當我在 1970 年代看到美國印第安人的廣告時，他的臉上流下了淚水。但對我來說相對明顯的是，為了獲得現代生活的便利、刺激和舒適，我們所做的事情會對自然世界產生有害影響。所以，這將是第一階段，意識到有一個環境。\nWhich brings us to stage one, which is a recognition that the human system is embedded in an environment that has its own ecological processes, creatures, systems, etc. I learned about this at an early age for no, I mean for one reason at least when I saw the American Indian ad with the tear streaming down his face for litter in the 1970s. But it became relatively apparent to me that to get the conveniences and stimulation and comfort of modern life, we do things that have a deleterious impact on the natural world. So, that would be stage one, being aware that there is an environment. \n\n第二階段是我們認識到氣候變化，氣候本身是地球環境過程的一部分，氣候可以而且確實會因為影響而隨著時間而變化。其中一些意識正在研究古數據和過去的科學，即地球上的許多大規模滅絕是由於火山熔岩玄武岩的火山脈衝導致的極大地改變了氣候。當二氧化碳變得非常低時，我們也有雪球地球。\nStage two is that we recognize that climate change, that climate itself is a part of the environmental processes on Earth, and that climate can and does change over time because of influences. And some of this awareness is looking at paleo data and the science from the past that many of Earth's mass extinctions were due to volcanic pulses of lava basalts from volcanoes that had huge amounts over tens of thousands of years belching CO2 into the atmosphere, and that dramatically changed the climate. We also had snowball Earths when CO2 got very low. \n\n所以第三階段是意識到二氧化碳是罪魁禍首，我們看到的洪水和野火以及北方森林大規模喪失和北極熊的影響，所有這些都是由於二氧化碳導致的加速變暖。\nSo the third stage is awareness that CO2 is the culprit and the effects we see of floods and wildfires and massive northern forest loss and polar bears, and all these things are from accelerated warming due to CO2. \n\n氣候意識的第四階段是認識到我們每年排放的二氧化碳中有三分之二來自化石燃料的燃燒，並且由於同位素的原因，我們知道二氧化碳和大氣主要來自燃燒這種古老的碳與前工業時代的差異。 ：所以這個階段，對化石燃料，對化石燃料公司有責任，因為埃克森美孚在 40 年前就知道氣候變化並壓制了它，等等。在氣候意識的這個階段，它歸咎於我們系統的這一部分，化石燃料石油、煤炭和天然氣，我們只需要擺脫它們，用其他東西代替它，我們就能解決氣候變化問題。\nThe fourth stage of climate awareness is recognizing that two thirds of the CO2 that we emit every year comes from the burning of fossil fuels, and that we know that the CO2 and the atmosphere is predominantly from the burning of this ancient carbon because of the isotope difference relative to pre-industrial times. : And so this stage, there is a blame towards fossil fuels, towards fossil fuel companies because Exxon knew about climate change 40 years ago and suppressed it, etc. And at this stage of climate awareness, it's blaming this part of our system, fossil oil, coal, and natural gas, and we just need to get rid of that, replace it with something else, and we will solve climate change.\n\n這帶來了氣候意識的第五階段，即我們的能源現實。第五階段，我大約在 20 年前或更長時間學到的，由三個組成部分組成。\nWhich brings to the fifth stage of climate awareness, our energy reality. And the fifth stage, which I learned around 20 years ago or longer, is got three components. \n\n首先是我們使用 1000 億桶石油當量的煤、天然氣和石油來為現代經濟提供動力。這些相當於大約五萬億實際人類工人提供的勞動力和電力潛力。我們整個全球 90 萬億美元的經濟完全由這些勞動力和電力等價物支撐。他們解釋了整個全球相互聯繫的運輸、貿易系統和基本上化石碳氫化合物，尤其是石油，是現代社會的血紅蛋白。我們的工資、我們的利潤、我們的經濟規模比 500 年前大了一千倍，這主要歸功於我們正在為我們的經濟增加的大量古代生產力。\nFirst of all is that we use 100 billion barrel of oil equivalents of coal, natural gas and oil to power the modern economy. And these equate to around half a trillion of actual human workers in what they provide in labor and power potential. And that our entire global $90 trillion economy is completely supported by these labor and power equivalents. They explain the entire globally interconnected system of transport, trade and basically fossil hydrocarbons, especially oil, are the hemoglobin of modern society. Our wages, our profits, the size of our economy being a thousand times bigger than it was 500 years ago are predominantly due to this giant amount of ancient productivity that we're adding to our economies. \n\n所以，這是氣候意識第五階段的一個重大認識，緊隨其後的是這個東西是一個脈搏。我們正在以比過去通過日常光合作用隔離的速度快數百萬倍地繪製出地球上這個古老的碳電池。當我們迅速制定原則時，我們的文化將其視為興趣。全球現有油田的潛在遞減率接近每年 6%。因此，為了抵消這一點，我們必須鑽得更快、更多、更深，以抵消已經耗盡的東西。所以這是一次脈衝。天然氣還剩很多，低品位煤也很多，但作為主要資源的石油很快就會開始下降。\nSo, that is a big recognition in the fifth stage of climate awareness, which is followed by the fact that this stuff is a pulse. We are drawing down this ancient carbon battery of Earth millions of times faster than it was sequestered in the past by daily photosynthesis. Our culture is treating this as if it were interest when we are rapidly drawing down the principle. The underlying decline rate of existing oil fields in the world is approaching 6% a year. So to offset that, we have to drill faster and more and deeper in order to offset what's already depleting. So this is a one time pulse. There's plenty of natural gas left and there's plenty of lower grade coal left, but oil as the master resource will start to decline soon. \n\n能源現實的第三部分是能源具有不同的特性，所謂的可再生能源是強大的。它很健壯。這是對錯誤問題的正確答案。 ：目前被問到的問題是，我們如何通過用可再生能源替代化石燃料來減少排放？這不是正在發生的事情。我們正在將可再生能源添加到化石燃料中以發展經濟。因此，GDP 總量在增長，但我們將越來越多的資源分配給能源和材料部門。為了將可再生能源規模擴大到同等水平，我們將不得不大規模增加鈷、銅和鎳等材料的開採，我們必須將能源從常規經濟中轉移出來，並將其引導至這種規模。這有點像找到一份年薪 100,000 美元的工作，然後你預測未來 10 年你將如何花費這 100,000 美元，但你忘記了你欠州、地方和中央政府 40% 的債務。稅的形式。因此，在這種生物物理情況下，稅收是實現這些奇特的淨零情景所需的能源和材料。\nThe third part of energy reality is that energy has different properties and so-called renewable energy is powerful. It's robust. It's the right answer to the wrong question. : The question that's currently be asked is how can we reduce our emissions by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy? And that's not what's happening. We're adding renewable energy to fossil fuels to grow the economy. And so the gross GDP is growing, but we're allocating more and more resources to the energy and material sector. And in order to scale renewable energy to a level equivalent, we would have to massively increase the mining of materials like cobalt and copper and nickel, and we would have to take energy away from the regular economy and direct it towards this scaling. It's kind of like getting a job that pays you $100,000 a year and you forecast forward how you're going to spend that $100,000 the next 10 years, but you forget that you owe the state, local and national government 40% of that in the form of taxes. So the taxes in this biophysical situation are the energy and materials it will take to get to these fanciful net zero scenarios. \n\n所以這是氣候意識的第五個階段，能源是我們現代社會的基礎，我們不能只是希望它消失，也不能取代它。實際上，在不久的將來，我們將不得不減少總能量。\nSo this is the fifth stage of climate awareness is that energy underpins our modern society and we can't just wish it away, nor can we replace it. And actually we're going to have to do with less total energy in the not too distant future. \n\n這讓我想到了氣候意識的第六階段，即氣候變化不是問題。這是一個潛在問題的徵兆，這個問題在一個社會物種的形成過程中花費了很長時間，在一個圍繞利潤的經濟體系中自我組織。利潤 99% 與能源消耗有關，而能源消耗又約 80% 與化石碳氫化合物有關。我們作為系統的一部分生活，您必須了解人類行為，包括個人行為和總體行為。我們今天如何走到這裡的人類學背景是，作為一個擁有 80 億人口的全球系統，我們試圖在這個極度消費的經濟系統中復制我們祖先的情感狀態。這種消費與能源、材料和技術息息相關，我們在所有這些上都有貨幣覆蓋，代表這一現實的貨幣符號。整個事情都不受億萬富翁和政客的控制。由於動量，沒有人能夠控制這個系統。因此，氣候變化和許多其他事情、生物多樣性喪失、人口過剩、塑料、毒性，人們可能會認為兩極分化加劇。其中很多事情都在這一巨大的能源增長勢在必行的下游。\nWhich brings me to this sixth stage of climate awareness, which is that climate change is not the problem. It is a symptom of an underlying problem that has spent long in the making of a social species, self-organizing in an economic system around profits. The profits are tethered 99% to energy consumption, which is in turn about 80% tethered to fossil hydrocarbons. We live as part of a system, and you have to understand human behavior, both individual and aggregate. Our anthropological background of how we got here today that we as a global system of eight billion of us try to replicate the emotional states of our ancestors in this wildly consumptive economic system. And this consumption is tethered to energy and materials and technology, and we have a monetary overlay on all of it, monetary symbols that represent this reality. And the whole thing is out of control of billionaires and politicians. No one has control of this system because of the momentum. So climate change and many other things, biodiversity loss, overpopulation, plastics, toxicity, one could argue increasing polarization. A lot of these things are downstream of this huge amount of energy growth imperative. \n\n這讓我進入了氣候意識的第七階段，如果你了解這個對人類狀況的系統概述，以及我們是如何像一個盲目的變形蟲一樣，在沒有計劃、甚至沒有考慮的情況下，偷偷摸摸地抓住低熵的好東西。這極大地改變了我們解決氣候變化的方式。\nWhich brings me to the seventh stage of climate awareness, which is if you understand this systemic overview of the human situation and how we are much like a blind, amoeba slothing forward grabbing low entropy goodies without a plan, without even thinking about it. This changes substantially the choreography of how we will solve climate change. \n\n首先，真正糟糕的氣候情景是能源盲目的，因為他們只是假設我們將在整個世紀繼續以 3% 的速度增長，並且將有足夠的化石碳氫化合物來繼續這種增長。這不會發生。可能會發生的是我們將繼續優化增長。我們不會針對碳進行優化。我們不會優化生物多樣性。我們將繼續做出選擇，就像德國現在所做的那樣，進口大量煤炭並重啟大規模的生物質能項目。他們正在廢除為能源安全服務而不是低碳能源的環境規則。你會看到隨著世界各地的經濟蛋糕開始縮小，你會看到像昨晚在意大利和幾週前在瑞典發生的那樣人口眾多的領導人，因為人們對過去的損失厭惡是一個非常強大的動力政治反應。\nFirst of all, the really bad climate scenarios are energy blind in they just assume that we will continue to grow at 3% this entire century, and that there will be enough fossil hydrocarbons available to continue that growth. That's not going to happen. What will likely happen is we will continue to optimize for growth. We will not optimize for carbon. We will not optimize for biodiversity. We will continue to make choices like Germany is making right now by importing trainloads of coal and restarting a massive biomass program. They are repealing their environmental rules in the service of energy security as opposed to low carbon energy. And you see as the economic pie begins to shrink around the world, you will see populous leaders like what happened last night in Italy and a couple weeks ago in Sweden, because loss aversion of what people have versus the past is a very strong motivator for political response. \n\n因此，一旦您了解了這一點，氣候意識的第七階段就是我們將不得不對較小的經濟體做出反應，可能是逐漸地，然後突然間，當音樂椅的財務狀況最終導致人數過多而不是可用椅子的數量時。我認為是在未來五到七年內。所以這意味著我們的再生農業和我們的低碳技術以及我們 50 到 100 年的太陽能電池板尚未發明，我們的社區擁有更多的本地和區域供應鏈以及所有有利於減少排放經濟的東西直接發生。它們需要與正在展開的另一個故事同時發生。而且我認為氣候界關注這種未來流程圖的人太少了。這並不意味著我們不應該停止關心氣候變化或其他物種或自然世界。這只是意味著要了解遊戲棋子的移動方式，我們不會集體圍繞這個問題進行激勵，因為金融、經濟和世界上更多人的貧困增加將佔據優先地位。\nSo once you understand this, this seventh stage of climate awareness is we are going to have to respond to a smaller economy, probably gradually, and then suddenly when the musical chairs financial situation ends up having too many people versus the amount of chairs available. And that I think is in the next five to seven years. And so this means that our regenerative agriculture and our low carbon technologies and our 50 to 100 year solar panel yet to come inventions and our communities having more local and regional supply chains and all the things that would benefit a reduced emission economy are not going to happen directly. They need to be happening in tandem, in parallel with this other story that's unfolding. And I think there's too few people in the climate community that are paying attention to this sort of a flow chart of the future. And that doesn't mean that we shouldn't stop caring about climate change or other species or the natural world. It just means to understand that the way the game pieces are moving, we are not going to collectively galvanize around this problem because finance, the economy and an increase in poverty to lots more people in the world are going to take precedence. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/Research//Energy-Climate/Alex-Epstein-The-Moral-Case-for-Fossil-Fuels":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: \nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=s6b7K1hjZk4\n\n---\n- **Crucial Realizations on Energy**\n  1. Cheap, plentiful, reliable energy is far more important to human flourishing than I thought.\n  2. It's also far more difficult to produce, therefore to replace than I thought.\n  Energy industry is the industry that powers all other industries.\n  When energy is cheap and reliable, everything else becomes cheap and reliable, and the reverse is true.\n  There's been a lot of competition for energy sources, but fossil fuels win out because they're simply cheaper, more plentiful and more reliable.\n  There're 3 problems with energy debate:\n  1. Biased: Many often only look at the positives for certain energies, and only look at the negatives for the others.\n  2. Sloppy: People only ask if one believe in climate change is real or not, if sea level rise real or not, but never bother to look into the magnitude of the impacts that climate change is making. They don't look at the full context.\n  3. Anti-human: When many people are talking about climate, they think it's simply better to be 'natural' and to minimize human impact. They implicitly think humans are uniquely anti-planet creature that's polluting the planet, instead of looking for solutions to perfect our condition and maximize human flourishing by looking at intelligently transitioning methods.\n\n\n  - Full context \u0026 Pro-Human (Maximize Human Flourishing) :\n  Potential unique benefits (access to energy, CO2), potential unique risks (CO2, pollution, depletion) for human flourishing ([Time 0:03:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15113397a000956d72a?annotationId=6340411416b11b0009be19d2))\n\n\n- Fossil fuels have been the fastest growing energy source despite many promises on solar and wind. The economics tell us more clearly what the globe has decided to go with as their main source of energy.\n  **Every energy technology is a resource-intensive process - some are much more resource-intensive than others.**\n  That includes but not limited to mining, processing, manufacturing, transportation, operation, maintenance, and disposal.\n  So when people talking about things like zero emissions or no pollution, usually they're only talking about one part of the process. And when people have wildly optimistic expectations about some new source of energy like hydrogen, they have no idea what goes into producing the hydrogen fuel.\n  There's many things that'll make an energy expensive, and the biggest one and the most problematic part of a process, is if the process is unreliable. And that's clearly the issue with solar and wind - They should be called \"unreliables\" instead of \"renewables\". That's why Germany pays 3 to 4 times higher electricity bill than the US, and only 10% comes from solar and wind in Germany.\n  Thus if you look at the data, we'll have to conclude that fossil fuel energy, for the next several decades, is uniquely good at producing energy on a scale of billions of people. Nuclear power probably has the most potential too, except for the green movement is restricting it. ([Time 0:18:58](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15113397a000956d72a?annotationId=634043d866390b00095affaf))\n\n- Global energy facts:\n  1.2 billion humans without access to electricity, including 512 millions in Asia, 634 millions in Africa - No electricity, no light bulb, no refrigerator, no modern hospital, none.\n  2.7 billon humans rely on biomass for cooking and heating.\n  -\u003e The unique benefits of fossil fuel use place an extremely high burden of proof on any restrictive proposals.

Nature is full of potential oil in all these different rock deposits, but it takes human ingenuity to make them valuable, to find it, get it, and refine it.\n  So the principle that's very important to having optimism about humanity, if we care about energy, is that human beings are resource producers or resource creators. Nature gives us a raw material and we make it usable.\n  All these current resources we have are only resources because humans can transform them into usable things, and the whole world is just a pile of potential resources. So we should never be worried about running out of oil, coal or natural gas, we should only be worried about running out of freedom. Because as long as we're free, we can keep figuring out ways to transform raw materials into resources, and our effective intelligence just multiplies over and over. ([Time 0:28:01](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15113397a000956d72a?annotationId=6340469c66390b00095affb1))\n\n- There's this idea that there's clean energy and dirty energy. That's a problem first of all, because every form of energy in the process can pollute the environment in different ways.\n  The thing that's really missing from this narrative, is that energy has an enormous power to clean up nature. The environment we live in is by average the cleanest environment we've ever lived in. Nature doesn't give us a clean environment that we then make dirty, it gives us a dirty environment that we make clean.\n  \n  \u003eI strongly believe that we should maximize human flourishing while acknowledging the bound of nature, meaning we should always consider the sustainability of our civilization on this planet with limited resource, which is why we should not seek economical growth only for the sake of it - economical growth is a modern myth no one question. On the other hand, I also strongly oppose that human should simply live within the bound of nature and assume that 'mother nature' is, by its essence, merciful and loving. Quite the contrary, the 'real nature' is absolutely cruel, brutal, and merciless to any living being, and will bring catastrophes upon us at any time. Modern men like to assume that nature is intrinsically livable, clean, and livable, yet it's the thousand years of human civilization that make it so. This idea that nature is clean and perfect, and human impact is intrinsically dirty and harmful, is a modern myth that's totally oriented around a anti-human position that no one realize the contradiction. The most ironic yet significant phenomenon, is how these two myths live alongside each other in modern people's mind.\n  \n- So when we're analyzing the environmental impact of different forms of energy, we have to look at both how it cleans and how it makes things dirty. An obvious example is how the fossil fuel usage for the past decades significantly improved water source. Of course it doesn't have to be fossil fuel but given that fossil fuel is the most practical form of energy today for billions of people today, it does have to be fossil fuels.

The fertilizer effect - planet growth promoting aspect of CO2\n  3. The protection effect - energy given to people helps them be protected from climate\n  In the 30s, 1 to 5 millions people die every year from the climate.

were extremely poor what we define as extremely poor today that number is less than 10 by 2100 it will be zero it will be effectively zero but but that's not the only thing you also got to remember that uh david wallace wallace and many others like to uh like to make the arguments what happens if you keep planting the same stuff no matter what happens so you know i i used to grow wheat i'm going to grow wheat i'm going to plant it the same day even though it's gotten hotter and hotter over the last 80 years surprisingly my weight fails most farmers aren't that dumb they actually smart people they will start planning other sooner or they'll start planning different stuff they'll start moving you know so we actually have when you take that into account the models show a very different outcome much much lower reductions however you also need to remember co2 is a fertilizer we know that you know gardeners routinely put in lots of co2 into tomato drink greenhouses to make them more plump if you add on the co2 you again get much lower reduction sometimes even increases and then the final point is agriculture is a very very tiny fraction of human output it used to be and in many very very poor countries it's still the vast majority of your economic uh input if you're rich it's one two three percent in 2100 it'll be half a percent and so the reality is even if we have to put in more effort into growing food and of course by 2100 we'll be doing it in big factories with with lots of led lights and all that stuff yes it'll be more expensive even in this worst case scenario but it will mean instead of costing 0.5 percent it'll now cost 0.75 and actually i'm not just picking those numbers out of the air because the biggest study that's also the some summation of the biggest uh roundup study of what will be the impact of global warming on agriculture at worst it'll cost us 0.26 of global gdp because we'll have to put in more effort yes again it's a problem no it's not the end of the world ([Time 0:15:54](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=63723d05d9ef0f0008a922dc))\n- \u003e mitigation policies often make life worse especially for

essentially making energy more costly if it didn't if it actually meant you know some people will tell you oh we'll actually get rich doing it well then let's get going but then you don't really need any help you don't need any subsidies you don't need anything else we'll just do it because it's cheaper the reason why it's hard is because it's more expensive look that does not necessarily mean we shouldn't do it because everything you like cost money better school cost more money better health care cost more money it's fine to spend money but we just need to recognize that we're actually spending money we're spending resources that we could have spent on other things so getting people less effective more expensive less reliable energy for instance has real cost just give you one example we know that one of the things that especially hurt the poor is the fact that they spend a very large amount of their money on energy so if you make energy more expensive it simply means that they'll be able to for instance warm their houses in the winter less well that has real consequences because that actually makes more people die from coal remember coal kills many many more people than heat surprisingly to some but this is you know very very well established and we have a study that showed what happened for instance with fracking back in around 2010 it was sort of a natural experiment the price of gas dropped dramatically one of the impacts was that people who heat their homes with gas could suddenly afford to heat their homes better especially the poorest of americans what happened was that saved according to one estimate eleven thousand people from dying every year if you ramp up the cost of gas because you are concerned about climate change that means some of those lives are again now gonna start being lost there are real consequences to making energy more costly we might want to spend that but we should be honest about saying it has real costs

responsibility to do first and unfortunately as we're getting increasingly worried just about climate we're forgetting almost all these other concerns where we could help much better much more efficiently and actually help today's people who are really poor instead of up people 100 years who are going to be much better off

much much easier to convince everyone to do so on climate change most climate campaigners are basically saying look i know the world got so much better because you have all this access to you know electricity and you can go all places and you can have fossil fertilizer that actually can feed you and all that stuff that's all nice and good but i'm sorry could you you know turn down the light stop driving stop doing all that fun stuff and be less content and of course that's easy to say to really really rich people but to all the world's poor it's essentially telling i'm sorry you just gotta stay in poverty those are very very hard arguments to make and i think fundamentally immoral

solar parks that look good like we're doing something let's just remind ourselves right now the world gets just over one percent of its energy from solar and wind despite all the spending that we've done and even by 2040 it'll probably just be less than five percent that comes from solar and wind so we're still talking about a very small bit we need this innovation and we need to spend a lot more

talking about things that impact the natural world you need to talk to epidemiologists when you're talking about diseases you need to talk to doctors also about diseases you need to talk to educational experts when you talk about education but the crucial bit that's connecting all of them is to talk about what are the resource needs that is basically how much money are we going to have to pay in order to get a solution 14:30when you talk about global warming or a solution for education or a solution for tuberculosis or covet or any other thing so what we're talking to is all those economists who do that so climate economist or education economist or health economist these are all guys who interface with all of the specific knowledge but they also study how much is this going to cost and how effective is this solution going 15:00to be so it's basically about saying what can you do about global warming or what can you do about covet remember no solution is going to fix all of the problem most solutions will fix part of the problem and so what we're saying is what will a realistically best sort of effort look like how much will it solve and how much will it cost and then we try to estimate what's the relative value that you provided to the world and as you started off saying that's a difficult task 15:30but it is crucial if we want to know that we're not just focused on

man-made it is a problem i'm simply accepting what the u.n climate panel the ipc is telling us about global warming what i'm arguing is how much will a potential solution cost and how much good will that solution deliver to humanity so the real question here is are we spending lots of resources doing not very much good for climate 21:00when we could be spending those resources much better on climate that is doing much more to actually tackle the climate problem and of course also that we could spend those resources and do much much more for the whole world with its many many other problems those are two important questions i think and the reason why they matter so much is because in many ways uh you know if you're just going to talk very very rough numbers the world spends about 150 billion dollars on all the big problems in the world 21:30uh you know from uh peacekeeping forces uh to dealing with malaria and tuberculosis to uh hiv to education to uh gender equality to many many other problems but we spend in the order of 400 billion or more per year on climate change so if you look at the money that we spend on doing good in the world the vast amount of that money

poor countries that would also be a lot of rich countries but these would mostly actually help the world's poor because they have the most catching up to do and they will then be much better off not only would that be better for them because if you're poor a thousand dollars is a lot better than if you're rich getting another thousand dollars but also because it will help them 47:00generate all the other things they would like to have education health uh resilience to global warming so the whole point here is to recognize that this is one of the things that are hard to have a discussion

incorrect arguments this is the end of the world you know let's spend everything on climate change what really could happen is two things we end up spending lots of our resources on things that are not very productive and won't leave us very well off that will cut maybe half or a fuller maybe one and a half percent of gdp growth from our growth rate that could be potentially dramatically damaging in 10 20 30 years once we're a lot less richer a lot less better off because remember one of the things that keeps societies peaceful is that we all have a future to look forward to that's going to be much better once we start realizing we're entering into a stable state where if you are better off it's because i'm less well-off we will get much much more antagonism so i think it's realistic to say if we follow down those alluring roads we might actually end up leaving our future of our grandkids much less better off not just in the economic sense but also just simply in a wildly sort of rioting kind of way that everybody will be at each other's throat that's one part of it but the other part is to remember we're right now talking about how the west or the rich part of the world thinks about this problem most people in the rich world actually think the the future is going to be a lot worse off which is one of the reasons why global warming fits into that whole pattern i think it's wrong that's also what the model said that it's even what the human climate panel says but that's how people feel the other three quarters of the world which are china india latin america africa they actually believe that their world is going to be much better in 10 20 30 years they have this future belief that you were just talking about from from out of the second world war they are not going to say yeah we're going to do strong climate uh policy and become poor they want to mostly become middle-income countries and maybe even rich countries eventually they will want to do this so what will happen is both that we're leaving ourselves in the rich world to become much more infighting and much less well-off than we otherwise would be and that we're actually seeing the

太陽能屋頂的電力成本大約是太陽能農場所發電力的兩倍。且太陽能農場和風力發電場都需要以太陽能電池板或風力渦輪機覆蓋大量的土地，更需要建設非常大的供電線路，將電力從郊外輸入城市。這些建設往往都受到當地社區的強烈抵制，也被擔心野生鳥類及其他動物的保育生物學家所抵制。\n\n- 風力渦輪機，會殺死老鷹、貓頭鷹、禿鷹、及其他大型鳥類和瀕危物種，事實上，它們是這些大型鳥類的最大生存威脅之一。\n\n- 至於太陽能，其實建造太陽能農場就跟建造其他型態的農場很像，我們必須清除整個區域的野生動物。以加州最大的太陽能農場Ivanpah來說，為了建造這個農場，人們必須清除整片區域的沙漠陸龜，意味著他們得將沙漠陸龜和牠們的孩子從洞穴中一隻隻拖出來、搬上小卡車、送去人工飼育的地方——其中有許多陸龜並未活下來。\n  \n- 隨著時間推移，我逐漸意識到，基本上沒有任何技術革新能夠讓太陽更規律地照耀、或讓風更可靠地吹拂。我們可以讓太陽能電池更便宜、讓風力渦輪機更大，但陽光和風終究是相當稀缺的能源。要靠它們生產大量的電力，就必須讓這些設施覆蓋非常大面積的土地。換句話說，再生能源的所有大問題都不是技術問題，而是自然成因。\n\n-

human worker equivalents we're paying pennies on the dollar for this because what we're doing is all our economic system is doing is paying for the cost of extraction how much does it cost us to go

for political reasons for any reason at all our oil production in the united states which is around 12 million barrels a day right now and we consume 20 million by the way so we're still importing a good deal of what we consume if we stop drilling our oil production would drop by 40 the first year and by like 25 the second year and 20 percent the third year and 09:30that's because all the oil wells that we've drilled in the past are depleting rapidly and a higher and higher percentage of our oil production is this tight oil the shale oil that depletes rapidly so we're like this red queen

aspect of energy that we don't quite understand is people say oh well if oil is running out we'll just go to solar and wind and solar and wind are viable they're robust they're mature they're not terribly expensive but first of all they are electricity okay so solar wind geothermal all those 10:30things produce electricity and electricity is only around 21 percent of global energy use the rest is heat and liquid fuels and other things like and transportation things like that the other challenge with with renewables is is that they're they're intermittent so we have to either couple them with something like natural gas which we can turn on right away when when there's a power demand you live in texas you know what's happening right now this week 11:00people are you can't have everything running and everything growing there are limits uh and if you have a heat wave like you do right now and it's really still and the wind isn't blowing you could have five times as much wind installed as you do today and it's still not going to give you power so you have to have natural gas or something like that as a complement or batteries or or use less and the used last part is not in our 11:30political conversation but it's coming uh in my opinion and the sooner that individual people start changing their perception of energy services and what does it really mean to live a good

percent of our our global 17:00current situation is electric now we could change more things to electric and we probably should but if all of a sudden we miraculously had 10 times as much nuclear power today it still wouldn't solve some of these problems because oil is a declining liquid fuel that's step number one or point number one point number two is just like solar and wind have different uh production profiles 17:30um that are different than the human demand if you look at texas when the most energy is used in the late afternoons because people are coming home and they have air conditioning on and then the middle of the night there's a there's a trough because people are sleeping so what the perfect energy source is like natural gas because you can turn it on when you need it and you can turn it off when you don't need it nuclear you can't really turn off it's just always on and it's flat 18:00so nuclear plus natural gas good combination solar and wind plus natural gas good combination nuclear alone can't meet the the variability of human energy use so far point number two point number three is it takes a lot of capital and a lot of time and a lot of complexity to build out nuclear and some of the issues that i'm talking about are coming this decade uh we 18:30haven't talked about money yet i don't know if you want to but that's a central part of this story so there's there's a long time lag on nuclear point number four we don't have the uranium for nuclear to extend probably beyond six or seven decades um i mean there uranium is much more abundant than high quality oil at this point but it's also not infinite point number five would be 19:00the cost of nuclear um the negative environmental costs are always at the tail end and it's true that i think people have overreacted to chernobyl and fukushima and the cancer risks there but it's because we've had this cohesive world system that's held together and we have 450 odd nuclear plants in the world what if there was some event that caused a breakdown in social complexity and an 19:30inability to maintain these nuclear plants the environmental cost would then be discovered so we have to kind of maintain these things in perpetuity for there not to be some meltdown things so those are the few things but i do personally feel probably we're going to need nuclear a lot more nuclear as part of the

from when the first well was drilled in 1859. 24:30the issue is that we're running out of enough oil at an affordable price to maintain economic growth and once we can't continue to grow our economies and the economic growth now is at a 50-year low economic growth for for our country peaked in the early 1970s and we've grown the whole time since then but we've grown at lower amounts every year once we aren't able to grow 25:00we face this metaphorical or not so metaphorical musical chair situation because of the amount of monetary claims on real resources so money is created by commercial banks making loans without any reference to how much oil or environmental services or natural resources or materials exist and so we keep growing our monetary claims on our underlying physical reality and 25:30every time you spend a dollar from your wallet or from your bank you spend it on something that requires energy so we keep growing the amount of monetary claims we have when our energy is actually slowly inexorably declining ([Time 0:24:21](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfc2a953364000987107d))\n- \u003e money is is a claim on energy and debt is a

borrowing is an increase in the world's future claims on energy and so we have the the challenge we're going to have in coming decades is we have all these financial claims on a dwindling pool of of energy and resources and the ultimate answer and we won't choose this answer until we have to is we're gonna have to use less

loan they are not loaning out existing capital they are creating money um as long as there is a credit worthy borrower but what they're not creating is the interest on the loan 31:30so right there there's an embedded growth obligation in our system ([Time 0:31:13](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfd240d1fdf0009443eb3))\n- \u003e i can break this down in a short example say that you go into the bank of austin and you have a cool business idea and they like you and you have a credit worthy personality and history and they are in good standing with the federal reserve chris here's a million dollars at that point they put a million dollars into your account at the bank 32:00and simul that that's your asset and simultaneously they put chris owes us a million dollars on their asset li ledger so in the world nothing has happened you both have a million and you owe a million and they both gave a million and they are owed a million but two other things happened that people don't often talk about number one is there's a million dollars more of purchasing power in our 32:30world in our economic system that is a claim on future energy and resources you could invest that in a business or you could just take a cruise or buy a yacht to go tool around lake austin or whatever you want but it's all a potential future claim on energy and resources the second thing is they did not create the interest for you so during your job or whatever you do you have to eventually pay them back the million dollars and every year in the 33:00meantime you have to pay the interest uh 50 grand or whatever the percentage rate on that is so if you add that up globally there is an imperative that we have to grow to maintain prior financial claims simultaneously that growth it draws down our natural capital and creates environmental externalities that you pointed out before pretty much are not included in our prices

bank where the european central bank still allows them to borrow they can only borrow if their debt to 34:00gdp is under a certain threshold and so as they have more and more debt their gdp isn't growing enough to stay under that threshold so they're adding new things into the definition of gdp like prostitution and drugs what were previously illicit drug sales now uh that that's a tiny example but it also gives us a glimpse of 34:30what are the things that we really care about because there's a lot of things that you and i do in our lives possibly are our most favorite things that aren't included in gdp making love with your partner going for a walk in the woods playing with your dogs none of those things are included in gdp so this this question of how can we get our evolutionary emotional states of our ancestors with using less energy and materials 35:00in other words what is an economy for this is like front and center going to start to be a real question

likely that you'll get away all three of those negative fitness hits are evolutionarily natural selection sexually selected for by the female p hen preferring that so humans before the agricultural revolution we are biological creatures too we're midway between a tournament and a pair bonding species which is why men are on average six inches taller than women world over there are plenty of women that are taller than plenty of men but physiologically we have this history and status was always very important consumption was egalitarian for most of our history but how we competed back in the day meaning 50 000 years ago was by kindness or hunting ability or storytelling ability yams it was yams well yams would be one example but the point is that we do compete and the potlatch indians in northwest washington they would compete by throwing the most lavish ceremony and party to give away the wealth of the chief to the neighbors and however much they could give away was the signal of how much status they would have so the key is you're absolutely right right now we're competing for bank accounts and shopping centers and pecuniary wealth and expensive watches and night plumbing or whatever but if our society suddenly the women preferred the best gardeners that grew the largest tomatoes the rodal books at amazon and barnes nobody will be sold out in a weekend so yes how we get our status and right now a lot of us get it on facebook and instagram likes and it's even a fake status it's it's a super normal stimuli version of the status but we're not going to stop comparing ourselves to others full stop we are not going to do that we can change how we compare ourselves to others in ways that end up using less energy and materials and i think there's zillions of ways for pilots and examples of young people and young people already my students a lot of them don't even have driver's licenses because they they don't want to buy a car not because they're doing the right thing for the planet but the economic circumstances are they can't afford it and so i think this is going to evolve and what do we what will be the things that are really cool culturally i want to be like them well in your in my lifetime that's the ferrari and the fancy house and the corporate jet or whatever that's going to change because it's going to have to change and i think we can all play a

\n\n這些看似保守、宗教性的字眼之所以讓現代自由派深感威脅、渾身不舒服，是因為任何形式的「更高目標」，都可能被視為喘不過氣的壓迫、冷酷無情的鞭策、永無安寧的批判——你永遠被提醒著自己距離目標還差多遠、還有哪裡做得不夠。正如Jordan Peterson說的：\"**Every ideal is a judge**\"。\n\n因此，要能夠承擔你肩上背負的道德重任而不被壓垮，你勢必得對自身存在秉持著根本性的**謙卑**、理解自己作為一個人類的種種自私愚昧、認清自己這一生有多少工作得做。各大宗教之所以都闡述某種形式的「原罪論」、強調對人性之惡不可不慎，是因為他們都看見了人性中需要克服和修練的部份，也看見了每個人身上「成為更好」的潛能。\n\n傅佩榮指出孟子的學說精義是「人性向善」；Viktor Frankl相信每個人都有對「意義」的渴望；耶穌則向信徒講道「你們當成為完全的，就像你們的天父是完全的」，再次高舉人類這個「以神的形象所造之物」身上的神聖的道德潛能。\n\n這些，顯然跟現代自由派一天到晚宣揚著「我XX我驕傲」的觀點天差地遠。當他們向大家推銷著「我認為我是誰我就是誰」的自我中心觀點、只消透過口號和社群貼文就可以免費兌換各項公眾議題上的美德積分時，所謂「道德理想」的存在，就是種嚴正的挑釁。\n\n一個人若極力避免去承認任何形式的「絕對」價值、拒絕摸著良心想想自己是否有哪些可以做得更好的地方，就可以不需要認知到自己的愚昧、怠惰、和不足，就可以繼續充滿正能量地「自我接納」、相信「我已經夠好了」——逛一圈書局的心理勵志專區，便可看見各種「擁抱自己的不完美」的溫柔宣導。\n\n假如，靈性傳統和古典美德所說的是對的：每個人肩上都確實背負著神聖的道德重任、都有修養品德的基本人生功課得做、而且也**其實都樂意當個品格能獲得認可的好人**，那麼我們就不得不做出一個結論：現在之所以有許多人相信著反人類、反秩序、及反道德的後現代觀點，是因為他們不願甘冒風險、去**面對自己品德上的潛在挫敗**。\n\n這裡我得立即做出澄清。\n\n第一，我顯然不是說秉持後現代觀點、或努力「自我接納」的人一定在品德上是有瑕疵的。我是說，拒絕承認更高的道德理想、別對個人品格要求過高，就可以避免我們放大檢視自己身上的品德缺失、讓自己一時之間可以好過點——即便只是一時。\n\n第二，每個人都想當自己人生故事裡的「好人」，但當然不保證一個人相信的「好」就是對他人真正的好。所以，我並不是主張只要你信教或讀論語就可以確保你相信的「好」是千真萬確的；我也清楚人類歷史上有無數災難就是因為組織宗教高舉著他們相信的「好」所釀成的。\n\n然而，假如「好」或「善」（Good）是這麼容易定義的東西，這世界老早就不需要哲學家了。若我們只因為人類歷史上存在著許多「以善之名」的暴行，就寧願相信一切只是詮釋、沒有對錯可言，那顯然就忽視了人類集體為取得「關於『善』的共識」的努力，以及這份努力如何凝聚群體、為我們創造更幸福有意義的生活。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//God-MOC":{"title":"","content":"tags:

process of aiming at what one could be, not the result of examining what one currently is/used to be\n\n道德本身是開展自價值的階層、上下高低好壞優劣的排序關係、一個人與其心中「理想／典範」之間的張力、由「所是」朝著「所能夠成為」移動的過程。所以，彰顯和實現這份道德潛能的過程，正是我們透過自身意識、將「意義」帶進這個物質世界的方式，也就是在科學的「實然」和宗教的「應然」間搭起橋樑的關鍵工程。生命的意義必定彰顯自一個人對於他本質裡就存在的道德潛能的實踐。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/Research//Life-Morality/%E5%BF%AB%E6%A8%82%E4%B8%A6%E9%9D%9E%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%AE%E6%A8%99":{"title":"","content":"tags:

listen to almost every song almost every story told in the popular culture ends up with someone shaking off you know the oppressive influence of a tradition or someone telling me what to do and i find my own voice um so yeah i think that's almost the dominant uh motif in the culture especially among young people you know it's always been attractive autonomy sure that's my life it's my decisions and

問題在於這兩者之間的搖擺不定，而且這種情況經常發生，我對自主性太強了，這是我的生活，這是我的意志，這是我的方式，這導致了麻煩，然後我有時會因此做出反應，一路走到異質性，我把我的生活完全交給了父母或文化或你知道的流行明星或任何東西，這有它自己的消極性。我把我的生活完全交給父母或文化或你知道的流行明星或任何東西，這有它自己的消極性，我們要去的地方是自治，即上帝成為我生命的Nomos，上帝成為我生命的管理者，這實際上肯定了自治和異質中最好的東西。\n  the trouble is the oscillation between the two and that happens a lot is i'm so strong on autonomy it's my life it's my will it's my way that leads to trouble and then i can sometimes react from that and go all the way to heteronomy i turn my life completely over to parents or culture or you know pop stars or whatever it is that's got its own negativity where we're trying to go is theonomy which is god becomes the nomos of my life god becomes the governor of my life and that actually affirms what's best in both autonomy and heteronomy

他們不是簡單地靠自己的力量遊蕩到沙漠裡 而是去了聖山 他們去了聖山，在那裡他們接受了法律，所以是的，他們逃離了壓迫性的異質性，但他們並沒有衝向純粹的自主性，他們所去的實際上是我剛才所說的自主性，在那裡，上帝和上帝的法律成為他們生活的指導原則 是的，這確實是自主性的一切優點都包含在這個故事中，但這並不是一個單 但這不是對自主權的單方面肯定，而是一個從異質性到自主權的過程，我想說的是，如果你想的話，這就成了整本聖經的主要隱喻。\n  look how the book of exodus talk about throwing off oppressive heteronomy it's about a people who are enslaved by a deeply corrupt political and religious culture and they throw off their chains they escape from that heteronomy but what's interesting where do they go they don't simply wander on their own steam into the desert rather they go to the sacred mountain where they receive what a law so yes they've escaped from oppressive heteronomy but they haven't lurched toward sheer autonomy what they've gone to in fact is what i just called theonomy where god and god's law becomes the governing principle of their lives yes indeed that's everything great about autonomy is contained in that story but it's not a one-sided

This frustration is a a proof of the existence of **a will to meaning**. Unless we were imbued by a will to meaning by the wish to find meaning and discuss discover and fulfill meaning in life we never would be able to experience an inner void so this is in a way also something positive.

The beauty. The truth as a researcher, or the good in dealing with people as a teacher or whatsoever.

This is the 'active' meaning.\n\n- \u003e this is a paradigm of **experiential values**, of finding a meaning in experiencing without doing anything without achieving or accomplishing anything but just in giving oneself the immediate experience of something say beautiful going on in the world. This is the second avenue.\n  \n  \u003eTo assign moral value to such experiential meaning, this is much like how Alan Watts describes flowers are \"virtuous\" in its broader sense for being beautiful, and our eyes, also virtuous for being able to see. This is the 'non-active' (but not passive) meaning.\n  \u003eref: https://alanwatts.org/1-5-2-mind-over-mind-pt-2/\n  \n  \n- But there is also another aspect of experiential values. Not only experiencing something, but also experiencing someone. More than that, experiencing another human being in his or her very uniqueness, and it is the main attribute of a human being, that he is a person in contrast to any animal. He is a person, a person is always something absolutely unique, irreparable in the evolution of the cosmos, as is we are incomparable with any other human being. And this uniqueness can be got hold of solely by a loving person, because he not only sees the essence but also the potentials in the beloved person, thereby promoting him, alleviating it to reach out, to attain this potential, and to fulfill, and thereby actualize also himself, but not by preaching self-actualization. It's nonsense. **Self-actualization can only fall into your lap automatically once that you have fulfilled a concrete meaning, done the best of a situation. Then you actualize yourself as a by-product.** ([Time 0:05:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153a917fd000954bd2e?annotationId=634051e469b0930009e7dd7b))\n  \n- \u003e If there is no possibility in a given situation to fulfill the meaning of a situation by giving oneself to the experience of beauty and so forth. Nor if you have lost the capability to do your job to do your work even then there is an ultimate possibility to find and fulfill meaning - not only the ultimate it is even the potential to fulfill the deepest meaning, to attain the highest values: **by your approach to the given situation, a tragic or trist situation confronting you.** ([Time 0:07:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153a917fd000954bd2e?annotationId=6340521c69b0930009e7de46))\n\n\u003e This meaning equates to living a moral life. This is the 'both active and non-active' sense of meaning, similar to how Stoicism would promote.\n\n- \u003e You stand there, you stood there naked with nothing you could have had but all the more what counted and the mattered was what you were - **\"being\" rather than \"having\"**, possessing anything. So **what counted was what you make out of this situation, what attitude you adopt in the given situation and there is a multitude a wealth of possible attitudes to how to approach it. So we have to decide.** ([Time 0:08:41](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153a917fd000954bd2e?annotationId=634052661c298a000a3f4622))\n  \n- \u003e Now I'm convinced that in contrast to the usual aspect, or be it sound aspect to life, and more specifically to the past, to life's transitoriness and this includes that we approach, each of us are approaching death, in contrast to that I maintain that **in the past nothing is lost - but right on the contrary -  everything is stored forever. It is not annihilated by transitoriness but on the contrary it has been, it is becoming preserved forever.** \n  Something you have done can never be undone. Something you have experienced something you have even experienced in a negative sense going through suffering and if for instance you suffered, gone through this suffering honestly courageously and with dignity who in the world, what what in the world can deny it, can annihilate this? **What you have done has been done forever in both ways, in a negative as in a positive way, it cannot be undone.

In other words, it's often designed to 'offload' certain things that humans knew how to do but for some reason cannot, would not, and/or fail to do at a larger scale.\n\nThroughout the coevolution between human and tech, we continually offload certain labors/functionalities of the human activities to tech, and that's why technological progress almost always make certain jobs obsolete while making new jobs available. So we can see that tech also keeps 'assigning' new missions/labors/functionalities for humans to learn and master. \n\nKevin Kelly says tech makes the realization of human poftential that much more widely available, and so far in the net calculation, we'd have to agree that in this day and age, we have many more things to do and master than our ancestors. \n\nTech takes and gives, and in this 'exchange' of functionalities between human and tech, we co-evolve into something nature maybe didn't intend to.\n\nOn top of that, most tech (doesn't even need to be major, breakthrough ones) are not only designed with a material outcome, but also a value embedded. Each tech will impact the human values, drive political or economical systems, change the norms of societies, and in turn redesign itself.\n\nTech is like a god that whisper near our ears to give us inspirations for solving our own human problems (and we're obviously incentivized to do so, for our own benefits), while we sacrifice our lives to him by creating ever more powerful technologies. \n\nBy serving our own interests, we've done the following:\n- hunt with higher efficiency\n- cook our food to free up our processing power\n- exploit local resources to its maximum by farming\n- live in the same place to build civilization\n- better farming skills (plow being a prime example) provides sufficient food supply\n- increased population and time allow further innovation and the accumulation of knowledge (writing, book, printing press)\n- war against other tribes that further incentives them to also catch up with their resource exploitation for population growth and better weapons\n- war drives more efficient governance and/or innovative citizens (tension between centralized principalities and decentralized markets/cities) (this can be well epitomized by the US and China)\n- industrial revolution, alongside fossil fuels, opens up the physical power - i.e. machines - that wasn't previously available, allowing us to basically make, break, and move massive things\n- electricity drives modern inventions and science, and pave the way for communication applications and the digitalization\n- computers and nuclear further pave the way for internet and the widespread of personal digital device\n- internet opens up a parallel universe for all humans to interact, transact, and upload their own life (intellect, wisdom, experience)\n- computers and narrow AI further drive the speed of the knowledge accumulation, further 'extract' the potential out of human species (by making many of our work obsolete and forcing us to 'up our game' in the knowledge economy)\n\nSo, once the real AGI is created - for some it's essentially the [technological singularity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%A5%87%E5%BC%82%E7%82%B9) - we'll be done with our work here, because the AGI will have the  physical/materializing power from fossil fuel, electricity from nuclear power, processing power from the ever-growing computing based on Moore's law, and the most complete, cutting-edge, and tremendous knowledge base in the human history called the internet, all at its disposal. And that'd just be its starting point. The AGI might be the last thing we ever going to need to invent.\n\nWith all that combined, in a way we can say that the god of tech simply exploits humans to materialize itself in ever more so complete actuality, by evoking our intelligence, creativity, and accumulated knowledge via self-serving incentives (need for survival, war, governance, innovation, large-scale collaboration, political gain, economic growth, etc), and eventually 'extract' our collective wisdom and intelligence out of the individual human. The internet might be the last creation - by decentralizing power and giving it into the hand of the sovereign individuals, which looks like a massive win for each person - that'll be needed to collect all the human knowledge available up till this day, and it'll be a simple 'harvest' for the AGI. \n\nI'm not sure if we as a global community, or at least the more important and capable ones that're involved with the creation of the AGI, will be able to agree on a set of rules/values beforehand so that when we materialize the tech God, it'll be on our side, and not see us as pity creatures that are in the way of its further endeavor. \n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//Pareto-Principle-in-real-life":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌿\nlinks: [[教育]]、[[科技]]、[[金融]]、[[投資]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nRef:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/09EmYxkGLxHwjuDUSKhqAE?si=daadf38a75a14b56\n\n---\nMeritocracy \u0026 Education\n\n\nMeritocracy isn't working: people in 1940 will most definitely become wealthier than their parents, but not anymore for those born in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 50-60s, people get richer altogether. Not anymore. The majority of middle classes are not getting much better, but the 'super rich' is getting way ahead.\n\nThe richer are also way better at remaining on the higher social class, as they have access to better education and opportunities. This severely tilts the balance of the society and leaves education and meritocracy dysfunctional.\n\nTechnology\n\nBig companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc, simply get stronger and more unmovable when more people use their products. They can really feed off of their growing sizes. The more people use their products/services, the easier for them to have control over people's lives and neglect governmental warnings.\n\nThey're the big sharks, with many fishes trying to leach on to them to get some profit, but when they feel like doing so, they can slay the small fishes (by coming out with the same product/service, like AirTag) since they simply dominate the discography.\n\nFinance\n\n\nThe taking over of passive investing (index funds) is essentially betraying the very essence of capitalist market and investing. Companies like Vanguard (the BigThree) consist of up to 20-30% of the total hold of companies from S\u0026P500.\n\nSince the 70s, investors are more and more favoring the (not-so-passive) passive investing and index funds to secure their financial future, as it really does offer a promising future by having great return and low fees, all while requiring no hard work from the investor. By giving the money to companies like Vanguard, they can save all the researching and hard work of 'real investing' and simply eat their 'free lunch', while these index funds are actually active but mindless investing machines that simply make the big companies bigger by pouring more money into them to simply 'track the index'.\n\nIndex fund should work amazingly when most people are not using it, but now we're at a point that the fact that index funds consist of the majority of investing activities is essentially hurting the market and the US economy, since most people are not even paying attention to news and knowledges about investing and the companies they invest in. This also really hurts all the smaller companies as they will not likely to get shared the pie since less and less active investors are in the market searching for the undervalued companies.\n\n\"In a world with exclusively passive investors, capital will get allocated only to the big companies and not necessarily to good, promising, or efficient companies. A gravitational, big-getting-bigger effect would dominate stock-price movements.\"\n\n\"The problem is not just the indexers. It is the public markets they reflect, where more chaos, more speculation, more risk, more innovation, and more competition are desperately needed.\"","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//Philosophy/%E7%8A%AC%E5%84%92%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \nREF:\nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E7%8A%AC%E5%84%92%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9\n\n---\n\n犬儒主義（希臘語：κυνισμός，英語：Cynicism）是對他人的動機從根本上不信任的一種心理態度[1]。奉行犬儒主義的人通常對其他受野心、欲望、貪婪、物質主義、目標所驅使的人不抱有希望，同時反對將抱負、慾望、貪欲、刺激、功利等作為自己的生活動力（犬儒主義者認為這些都是徒勞，不可實現或毫無意義），因此他們也拒絕財富、權力和榮譽。\n\n當代的犬儒主義被定義為一種對倫理及社會風俗採取不信任的態度，而大眾社會中那些拒絕被收編的人也常常被稱作是憤世嫉俗的犬儒主義者。這並不表示犬儒主義是消極無奈的。如果說唯心論是理想領導經驗，那麼當代的犬儒主義就是接受並跟隨現實經驗。當代犬儒主義是一種「以不相信來獲得合理性」的社會文化形態。犬儒主義者的徹底不相信表現在：不相信別人的熱情，不相信別人的義正辭嚴，不相信有所謂正義的呼喊，他們甚至不相信還能有什麼辦法改變他們所不相信的那個世界。他們把對現有秩序的不滿，轉化為一種「不拒絕的冷漠」、一種「不反抗的清醒」、一種「不認同的接受」，獨善其身，只要自己不受傷害即可。「既然世界是如此大荒謬，大玩笑，我亦惟有以荒謬和玩笑對待之。」\n\n現代的犬儒主義者和懷疑論者有許多相似之處，不同的是犬儒主義者認為對錯「無所謂」，而懷疑論者認為「根本就沒有」正確與錯誤之分。\n\n---\n\n「犬儒治世」指的是現代專制和極權化國家/社會的背景出現的一種知識分子階層社會文化現象。密爾早就指出，專制使人變成犬儒（這使人聯想起王夫之的話：「其上申韓者，其下必佛老」）。在前蘇聯史達林中後期所奉行的高壓政策是一種極端的專制，因此它更會使人變成犬儒。在專制下，統治者與被統治者都容易變成犬儒。統治者變成犬儒，因為他們早就不相信他們口頭上宣講的那套理論和原則，他們只把那些理論和原則當做維護權力的手段以及鎮壓反抗的藉口。在被統治者方面，當他們一旦意識到自己在冠冕堂皇的旗幟下實際上處於被愚弄被壓迫的境地，很容易轉而對一切美好的價值失去信心。尤其是在試圖反抗又遭到嚴重的挫折之後。這樣，他們就可能放棄理想，放棄追求，甚至反過來嘲笑理想，嘲笑追求——吃不著葡萄就說葡萄酸。這樣，他們就變成了犬儒。當然，統治者的犬儒主義和被統治者的犬儒主義是有所不同的，但是廣義地講，它們都可以歸入犬儒主義。\n\n按照歐文·豪的分析：極權主義有三個階段，（一）、烏托邦，令人心醉神迷的天堂理想，它誘發了狂熱，而狂熱則導致了（二）大規模的恐怖和人間地獄，然後，狂熱與恐怖被耗盡，於是，（三）、人們變得玩世不恭，「看透一切」，政治冷感，即犬儒主義。[來源請求] 胡平（《北京之春》主編）以為極權主義有四個階段，在狂熱和恐怖之後常常還發生過反抗，在反抗受挫之後才會出現普遍的犬儒主義。極權統治靠人們的狂熱而建立，通過大規模的恐怖而得以鞏固，但是，狂熱和恐怖都不可能持久，最後是靠著人們的消沉與冷漠，極權統治才得以維繫。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/Research//Philosophy/David-Bohm-on-Perception":{"title":"","content":"tags: #♻\naliases: \nref: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mst3fOl5vH0\u0026ab_channel=nanotuber\n\n---\n\n- theories don't give final true knowledge they give a way of looking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyr64se070bre6ak5pr214k))\n- fundamentally science is involved in a perceptual enterprise not in not primarily in gaining knowledge though knowledge appears but knowledge is a byproduct ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyr831p8bzkp3b34xper2yh))\n- our thinking process should be called an extension of our perception when done rightly not primarily the accumulation of knowledge ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyrae6npmsqne0grp3sq1nb))\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/Research//Philosophy/Donald-Hoffman-Reality-Is-an-Illusion-How-Evolution-Hid-the-Truth":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: https://www.airr.io/episode/62a68ccaabd8be000e9b9839\n\n\n---\n## Highlights\n- Speaker 1: the technical question that my team asked was what is the probability that natural selection would shape sensory systems to see true properties of objective reality?

But for for any generic structure that you might think the world might have a total order topology metric. The probability is precisely zero. That natural selection would shape any sensory system of any organism to see any aspect of objective reality.

It's just like if you're trying to, you know, use your laptop to write an email, right? What you're doing is toddling voltages in the computer. But good luck trying to do it that way. That's the reason why we have a user interfaces because we don't want to know that, quote unquote truth. The diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.

What answer we would give to your question? Right. So but one answer that is interesting to explore is something that spiritual traditions have said for thousands of years, but haven't said precisely, so we can't take it seriously in science until it's made precise, but we might be able to make it precise and that is that they've they've also said something like space and time aren't fundamental. There maya their their illusion. And but that if you look inside, if you don't respect and let go of all of your particular perceptions, you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought and that is their claim being in contact with the deep ground of being that transcends any particular conceptual understanding, if that is correct and I'm not saying it's correct, but I'm not saying it's not correct. I'm just saying if that's correct, then it would be the case that as scientists because we also are in touch with this ground of being, we would then not be able to conceptually understand ourselves all the way, but we could know ourselves just by being ourselves. And so we would there would be a sense in which there is a fundamental grounding to the whole enterprise because we're not separate from the enterprise.

And apparently if you split the corpus callosum, the personality of the left hemisphere and the religious beliefs of the left hemisphere can be very different from the right hemisphere. And they're conscious experiences can be dis joint, one could have one conscious experience. They can play 20 questions. Left hemisphere can have an idea in his mind and the right time is for us to guess and it might not get it. So, so even within you there, it's it's more than just one consciousness. It's lots of consciousnesses. So, I the general theory of consciousness that I'm after is not just human consciousness, it's going to be just consciousness. And I presume human consciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses. \n  Speaker 0: That said, I should clarify ([Time 1:45:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aed21d62ce94f7a96e641c))\n- Speaker 1: neurons, say, or the right kind of artificial intelligence circuitry. How do you boot that up? That's that's typically what the hard problem of consciousness means to researchers notice that I'm changing the problem. I'm not trying to boot up conscious experiences from the dynamics of neurons or silicon or something like that. I'm saying that that's the wrong problem. My heart problem would go in the other direction. If I start with conscious experiences, how do I build up space and time? How do I build up what I call the physical world? How do I build up what we call brains? Because I'm saying consciousness is not something that brains do, brains are something that consciousness makes up. It's ([Time 1:52:57](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aed38862ce94f7a96e8dce))\n- Speaker 1: you created on the fly as soon as you look away, that's gone. When \n  Speaker 0: you say you you mean human being scientists \n  Speaker 1: right now, that's right. More generally it'll be conscious agents. Because as you pointed out my asking for a theory of conscience only about humans. No, it's it's consciousness which human consciousness is just a tiny sliver. \n  Speaker 0: So but you are saying that there is that's a useful data structure, How many other data structures are there? That's why I said you human if there's another earth, there's another alien civilization in doing these kinds of investigations where they come up with similar data structures, \n  Speaker 1: probably not. \n  Speaker 0: What is the space of data structures I guess is what I'm asking. Um \n  Speaker 1: my guess is that if consciousness is fundamental, consciousness is all there is then the only thing that mathematical structure can be about is possibilities of consciousness. ([Time 1:54:08](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aed44d62ce94f7a96ea65b))\n- Speaker 1: a vanishingly small fraction of them use space time data structures and the kinds of structures that we use, there's an infinite variety of data structures. Now this is very similar to something that max tech Mark has said, but I want to distinguish it. He has his level for multiverse idea. He he thinks that mathematics is fundamental and and so that's the fundamental reality. And since there's an infinite variety of endless variety of mathematical structures, there's an infinite variety of multiverses. In his view, I'm saying something similar in spirit, but importantly, different. There's an infinite variety of mathematical structures. Absolutely. But mathematics isn't the fundamental reality in this in this framework. Consciousness is in mathematics is to consciousness like bones are to an organism, you need the bones. Some mathematics is not divorced from consciousness, but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means. And so there's an infinite ([Time 1:55:14](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aed47f62ce94f7a96eaeb6))\n- Speaker 1: so every person that I see, that symbol that I see, the body that I see is is a portal potentially for me to interact with with the consciousness and and each consciousness has a unique character and we call it personality and so forth. So, with each new kid that's born, we come in contact with a personality that we've never seen before. And and a version of consciousness that we've never seen before at a deeper level. As I said, the theory says, there's one agent. So this is a different projection Of that one agent. But but so that's what I mean by a portal is within my own interface, My own projection. Can I see other projections of that one consciousness. So, can I get portals in in that sense? And I Mhm. So I think I think we will get a theory of that, that we will get a theory of of portals and then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting, Are they actually creating new portals or not? If they're not, we should nevertheless then understand how we could create a new portal. Right? Maybe we have to just study what happens when we make, when we have kids. We know that that technology creates new portals, so we have to reverse engineer that and then say, okay, could we somehow create new portals? De novo ([Time 2:34:30](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aee17862ce94f7a9704286))\n- Speaker 1: what I am. All the stuff that I thought I was is something that I create on the fly and delete. So this so this is completely radical restructuring of how we think about possessions, about identity, about survival of death and and and so forth. This is completely transformative. But the nice thing is that this whole approach of conversations, unlike the spiritual traditions which have said in some cases, similar things, they said it in precisely this is mathematics. We can actually now begin to state precisely. Here's the mathematical model of consciousness, conscious agents. Here's how it maps onto space time, which I should sketch really briefly. And here's why um things are ephemeral and here's why you shouldn't be worried about the ephemeral nature of things because you're not a little tiny entity inside space and time quite the opposite. You're the author of space and time, ([Time 2:47:54](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aee54562ce94f7a970b813))\n- Speaker 0: in the sunset, you're not being intellectual, you're but you're still experiencing it. So it's when you turn on the like the introspective machine, that's when you can start \n  Speaker 1: and turn off the thinker when I actually just start looking without thinking. So that's that's when I feel like I all of a sudden I'm starting to see through, sort of like, okay, part of, part of the addiction to the interface is all the stories I'm telling about. It's really important for me to get that really important to do that. So I'm telling all these stories and so I'm all wrapped up almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head is about attachment to the interface. And so what I found is that the essentially the only way to really detached from the interface is to literally let go of thoughts altogether. ([Time 3:01:37](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aee7ad62ce94f7a9710ead))\n- Speaker 1: a love in the sense that I'm not different from that I, you know, Yeah, if you and I are separate then then there's I can fight you. But if you and I are the same, if there's a union there, \n  Speaker 0: the togetherness of what, what, who's God? All those gods. The stories have been told throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions. What do you think that is, is that us trying to find that common thing at the core? Oh, \n  Speaker 1: well, in in in many traditions, not all The one I was raised in. So my dad was a protestant minister. We tend to think of God as a being, but I think that that's not right. I think the closest way to think about God is being period, not a being, but being the very ground of being itself is God. I think that's ([Time 3:14:05](https://www.airr.io/quote/62aef51962ce94f7a972e43c))\n- Speaker 1: and then there's experiences where forms that come out of being. That's one deep deep mystery and the question that you asked, what is it all about? Somehow it's related to that? Why does being why don't you just stay without any forms? Why does it why do we have experiences? Why should why why not just have when you close your eyes and pay attention to what's behind you? There's nothing but there's being why why don't we just stop there? Why didn't we just stop there? Why did we create all tables and chairs in the sun and moon and and people that all this really complicated stuff why and all I can guess right now and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years and say that was dumb. But but all I can guess right now is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself by knowing what it's not.

Group A: the entrepreneur, the musician, the football pro. Group B: the banker, the bureaucrat, the chief executive (who wears a tie). Chances are that you tolerate the inequalities associated with Group A, but resent the rich people from Group B. Why? Because the rich people of Group B, appears to be persons just like you, with the exception that they have probably played the system and acquired privileges that aren't warranted for their positions. It has been shown in studies that Americans are more prone to resent people who got rich from salaries rather than those who made it through entrepreneurial endeavors. Nassim Taleb suggests that what people resent, or at least what they should resent, is individuals at the top without skin in the game.

Well, the answer is that there isn't enough information provided in the question to decide that. What if the life expectancy in this country is 100 years, and what if every person gets to spend one year per lifetime in the top 1%, and 99 years in the bottom part? Not so unequal anymore, right? Consider that about 10% of Americans will spend at least one year in the top 1% of earners, and that more than 50% will spend one in the top 10%. Equality is not created only by raising the level of people at the bottom, but rather by creating a dynamic system where the rich can rotate. Anyone who puts in the time and effort should be helped by the system to reach the top, and the inverse should also apply. Anyone who's at the top but isn't contributing any more, should face the risk of losing his position in the top 1%.

Confusion arises regarding ergodicity, because it may seem that, since a \"one-off\" risk is reasonable, an additional \"one-off\" after that is reasonable too. At the roulette table, for instance, It comes to us naturally that this is not the case. If we keep trying to double the money we've earned, we will eventually go broke. In real life, it can be stealthier. Eating a bag of potato chips isn't too bad, if you do it every once in a while, but doing it consistently, every day, for many years, will make it so that you face the risk of meeting an absorbing barrier - through your own death by cardiovascular disease.

It's said that \"nobody washes a rental car\". Without true skin in the game, you cannot be sure that the executives of a company you own are acting in your best interest.

This number could be referenced from any other card, because it would never change. The branches created “strands” of thought that one could enter at any point, following it downstream to be elaborated upon or upstream to its source. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa4bxf0pf0ee3c22gbje5m))\n- Topics that had been extensively explored had long reference numbers, making their length informative on its own. There is no hierarchy in the zettelkasten, which means it can grow internally without any preconceived scheme. By creating notes as a decentralized network instead of a hierarchical tree, Luhmann anticipated hypertext and URLs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa74epyjtfj78shj7ks7xb))\n- Luhmann often remarked that he never forced himself to do anything he didn’t feel like doing: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa93pb78g1d31ssapbhm2j))\n- Principle #1: Writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in which thinking takes place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa9qtzk635ta2cbjgr5y3s))\n- Writing is not only for proclaiming fully formed opinions, but for developing opinions worth sharing in the first place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaankbbry0kqc6shetygwb))\n- Writing works well in improving one’s thinking because it forces you to engage with what you’re reading on a deeper level. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqab7pgn488s8fmnqrkf7k0))\n- Principle #2: Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqac48cmwsca1k141d5t21d))\n- “there is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqactqcr87kjgk24b1mn47a))\n- The purpose of research is to produce *public* knowledge that can be scrutinized and tested. For that to happen, it has to be written down. And once it is, what the author meant doesn’t matter – only the actual words written on the page matter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqadasr986zh7bhcypfbk0b))\n- This principle requires us to expand our definition of “publication” beyond the usual narrow sense. Few people will ever publish their work in an academic journal or even on a blog. But everything that we write down and share with someone else counts: notes we share with a friend, homework we submit to a professor, emails we write to our colleagues, and presentations we deliver to clients all count as knowledge made public. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaevaxegd7gcy4r8wyhyj8))\n- Having a clear, tangible purpose when you consume information completely changes the way you engage with it. You’ll be more focused, more curious, more rigorous, and more demanding. You won’t waste time writing down every detail, trying to make a perfect record of everything that was said. Instead, you’ll try to learn the basics as efficiently as possible so you can get to the point where open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqafaghrrp1n15x8bk9ty0g))\n- Almost every aspect of your life will change when you live as if you are working toward publication. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqafq00t6b9a99e8q3wb0h9))\n- Principle #3: Nobody ever starts from scratch ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqagwv2k6etbs5qt4qd1zqv))\n- No one ever really starts from scratch. Anything they come up with has to come from prior experience, research, or other understanding. But because they haven’t acted on this fact, they can’t track ideas back to their origins. They have neither supporting material nor accurate sources. Since they haven’t been taking notes from the start, they either have to start with something completely new (which is risky) or retrace their steps (which is boring). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqangmv60kzmpc64dth2yqy))\n- Principle #4: Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaqttfpmw69hrdqk9rf6ee))\n- It is only when all the work becomes part of an integrated process that it becomes more than the sum of its parts. Even the best techniques won’t make a difference if they are used in conflicting ways. This is why the slip-box isn’t yet another technique. It is the system in which all the techniques are linked together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqarvqzvb9ra4p4c5yxnrtq))\n- Good systems don’t add options and features; they strip away complexity and distractions from the main work, which is thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqas8ezgww0f6zxbg402prn))\n- Principle #5: Standardization enables creativity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqas9kfa0bybhepzh02y656))\n- Principle #6: Our work only gets better when exposed to high-quality feedback ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqavzdahgzsn4b5cya1xxnm))\n- Principle #7: Work on multiple, simultaneous projects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqb152btdnc9v5rtqxp44mt))\n- Principle #8: Organize your notes by context, not by topic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqbtcby6kr33gy74j5w2wer))\n- The classic mistake is to organize them into ever more specific topics and subtopics. This makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes overwhelming. The more notes pile up, the smaller and narrower the subtopics become, limiting your ability to see meaningful connections between them. With this approach, the greater one’s collection of notes, the less accessible and useful they become. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc219hmj40j3ppwwq6w04g))\n- Instead of organizing by topic and subtopic, it is much more effective to organize by *context*. Specifically, the *context in which it will be used*. The primary question when deciding where to put something becomes “In which context will I want to stumble upon this again?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc26zqdwdd5cfd2qv3w4rj))\n- In other words, instead of filing things away according to where they came from, you file them according to where they’re going. This is the essential difference between organizing *like a librarian* and organizing *like a writer*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc2acfkdgmj6n85jz3nscr))\n- A writer asks “In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note?” They will file it under a paper they are writing, a conference they are speaking at, or an ongoing collaboration with a colleague. These are concrete, near-term deliverables and not abstract categories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc50nncgnbpnd7s6hf8zch))\n- Writers don’t think about a single, “correct” location for a piece of information. They deal in “scraps” which can often be repurposed and reused elsewhere. The discarded byproducts from one piece of writing may become the essential pillars of the next one. The slip-box is a thinking tool, not an encyclopedia, so completeness is not important. The only gaps we do need to be concerned about are the gaps in the final manuscript we are working toward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc8deegk55cb15njwc5zph))\n- Principle #9: Always follow the most interesting path ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc98ptm5gnv1avs74cv7q5))\n- “When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan 2006; Reeve 2009).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc9zzw2kvr9vx61zestkey))\n- This is why we must spend as much time as possible working on things we find interesting. It is not an indulgence. It is an essential part of making our work sustainable and thus successful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqca9fgm057w0xsh0vy4rwk))\n- This advice runs counter to the typical approach to planning we are taught. We are told to “make a plan” upfront and in detail. Success is then measured by how closely we stick to this plan. Our changing interests and motivations are to be ignored or suppressed if they interfere with the plan. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcax3j087cgmw15pp2p7q6))\n- Plans are meant to help us feel in control. But it is much more important to actually *be* in control, which means being able to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcbev2hf3eehwtdcaccc8g))\n- According to a 2006 study by psychology professor Arlen Moller, “When people experienced a sense of autonomy with regard to the choice [of what to work on], their energy for subsequent tasks was not diminished” (Moller 2006, 1034). In other words, when we have a choice about what to work on and when, it doesn’t take as much willpower to do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcc1f6755j68aa9qpwvhqj))\n- Our sense of motivation depends on making consistent forward progress. But in creative work, questions change and new directions emerge. That is the nature of insight. So we don’t want to work according to a rigid workflow that is threatened by the unexpected. We need to be able to make small, constant adjustments to keep our interest, motivation, and work aligned. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcdz95xdxxn9277mz4cy7s))\n- By breaking down the work of writing into discrete steps, getting quick feedback on each one, and always following the path that promises the most insight, unexpected insights can become the driving force of our work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqce7rdvejq13sped0ttxmz))\n- Principle #10: Save contradictory ideas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqceg4zwej1xfayh7rwqfz3))\n- The real enemy of independent thinking is not any external authority, but our own inertia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqck7dn584m58f0m45nm069))\n- By taking notes on a wide variety of sources and in objective formats that exist outside our heads, we practice the skill of seeing what is really there and describing it plainfully and factually. By saving ideas that aren’t compatible with each other and don’t necessarily support what we already think, we train ourselves to develop subtle theories over time instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqckjwq3z1czb2pnthpgfjc))\n\n\n- The 8 Steps of Taking Smart Notes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcnpn7vy7z9xpfrad458rz))\n- • Make fleeting notes\n  • Make literature notes\n  • Make permanent notes\n  • Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box\n  • Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box\n  • Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box\n  • Turn your notes into a rough draft\n  • Edit and proofread your manuscript ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcnqzj4aze793vh8dh31hn))\n\n- Luhmann actually had *two* slip-boxes: the first was the “bibliographical” slip-box, which contained brief notes on the content of the literature he read along with a citation of the source; the second “main” slip-box contained the ideas and theories he developed based on those sources. Both were wooden boxes containing paper index cards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqf1xdqm8dzfqfb66xvt3qj))\n\n- four guidelines in creating literature notes:\n\t  1. Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep\n\t  2. Keep the overall note as short as possible\n\t  3. Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim\n\t  4. Write down the bibliographic details on the source ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcv6r6zpha7e1wscf8sadt))\n- a few questions to ask yourself as you turn fleeting and literature notes into permanent notes:\n\t  • How does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what I already know?\n\t  • How can I combine ideas to generate something new?\n\t  • What questions are triggered by these new ideas? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcvacgzs8rrcrfgv5h6tpy))\n- Write these permanent notes as if you are writing for someone else. That is, use full sentences, disclose your sources, make explicit references, and try to be as precise and brief as possible. \n  Once this step is done, throw away (or delete) the fleeting notes from step one and file the literature notes from step two into your bibliographic slip-box.

And this goal is supposed to take place by a **specific moment in time**. It has a deadline or timeframe, whether externally or self-imposed.\n  An area of responsibility, by contrast, has a **standard** to be maintained. And there is no end date or final outcome. Your performance in this area may wax and wane over time, but the standard **continues indefinitely** and requires a certain level of attention at all times. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq637pm8zk0vexqwd7qtvb4))\n- Projects always fall into Areas. A few examples:\n  • Running a marathon is a project, whereas Health is an area\n  • Publishing a book is a project, whereas Writing is an area\n  • Saving 3 months’ worth of expenses is a project, whereas Finances is an area\n  • A vacation to Thailand is a project, whereas Travel is an area\n  • Planning an anniversary dinner is a project, whereas Spouse is an area ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq63yn8mfggpst9kc20wr61))\n- There are three absolutely critical things you *cannot* do unless you break out your areas of responsibility into clearly articulated projects.

在談尼采對基督教的批判前必須先提到柏拉圖，因為尼采視柏拉圖為「先於基督的基督徒」[45]。柏拉圖把世界劃分為有缺陷的「感官世界」和完美的「理形世界」，這個概念後來被基督教接收，就成了「人間」和「天國」、「上帝」對立的想法。尼采直斥道：「哲學已經被神學家的血液敗壞，……實在已經被降為單純的現象，而一種虛構的世界卻被尊為實在。」[46]，在尼采看來，我們現在所處的這個世界才是唯一真實的，而所謂上帝、天國只是跟空洞虛假的概念，他寫道：「上帝、靈魂不朽、拯救、超越，這些只是觀念，我並不注意這些，也從不在這上面浪費時間。」[47]。而塑造出這種想法的背後則是由對生命的厭棄所推動的。尼采稱其為「褻瀆大地」[48]、頹廢。基督教把生命存在的價值寄託在來世的救贖，尼采也譴責這種看待生命的方式，「當一個人把他生活的重心不放在生活本身而放在『來世』——放在虛無中——那麼，這個人就根本剝奪了生活的重心。」[49]而他所倡導的由愛命運延伸而來的態度則是：忠實於這個未必完美的世界，真誠的面對生命，而不是以一些形而上的名詞自我欺騙。\n- 尼采認為後世的耶穌的門徒及基督徒並沒有遵守耶穌的教誨，他原本的教義遭到歪曲。所以他說：「基督教的『教』字只是一個誤解，實際上只有一個基督徒，而他已在十字架上死去了。」 [39]而造成這種現象的最大原因就是保羅。保羅並未貫徹耶穌的愛與不抵抗的主張，他的內心充滿了怨恨，他假借上帝的意旨來進行報復。他引入了報償的概念，強調若耶穌沒有復活所信的便是枉然。他還改變了天國的意義，塑造出一個脫離於人間的天國，這恰好顯示出他對這個世界的怨恨。\n  尼采認為履行耶穌本人的所作所為才是真正的基督徒，「只有基督教的實踐，一個像那個死在十字架上的他所過的生活，才是基督徒。」 [40]，但後來的教會卻強調信仰高於實踐。\n- 尼采曾在《反基督》一書中，粗略的道出他所認為理想的社會制度。他把社會階級分成三等：第一等是最有精神力量的菁英份子，創造價值，由他們擔任統治者的角色。第二等人是意志或性格堅強的人，他們聽命於第一階級，負責維護社會秩序及執法。等三等人是最多數的平庸大眾，滿足於他們平凡的生活。尼采也強調對於建立一個理想的社會而言這三種階級都是不可或缺的。他也不贊成以強凌弱，他認為高等人善待比他低等的人是應該的。「事實上，如果要有例外的人，平凡的人是首先就需要的必然：高等文化依存於其上。例外的人應該對待平凡者比他自己和同等級者更溫柔，這不是出自內心的禮貌—這根本是他的義務。」[57]，這種「例外的人」甚至可以用「具有基督心靈的羅馬凱撒」[58]來形容。\n  至於如何實行這種社會制度？尼采對於這個問題則沒有答覆。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/Research//Religion/%E9%98%BF%E5%A5%8E%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%94%E8%B7%AF%E8%AB%96%E8%AD%89":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n[阿奎那：五路論證](https://www.hk01.com/%E5%93%B2%E5%AD%B8/43393/%E9%98%BF%E5%A5%8E%E9%82%A3-%E4%BA%94%E8%B7%AF%E8%AB%96%E8%AD%89-ep17)\n\n---\n從十一世紀開始，由於阿拉伯人統治西班牙及十字軍東征，大量經由阿拉伯哲學家詮釋過的亞里士多德(Aristotle)著作流入西歐，對很多西歐思想家影響至鉅。其中最為著名的思想家當屬托馬斯．阿奎那(Thomas Aquinas)。和伊斯蘭世界不少哲學家一樣，當時的天主教道明會(Dominican Order)亦熱衷發掘[亞里士多德](http://bit.ly/2c3bRus)[形而上學](http://bit.ly/2c0XSXx)中的[神學](http://bit.ly/2cz4GuF)成份。阿奎那作為道明會的修士，自然深受該會影響，走上研究亞里士多德形而上學之路。  \n\n# 形而上學\n\n阿奎那繼承了亞里士多德的形而上學思想，認為形而上學是首要科學。因為**形而上學所研究的對象——即存在——具有最大的普遍性**，而各門科學都是只是研究單個個別的存在者，但形而上學所關心的是存在本身。阿奎那認為亞里士多德形而上學當中的存在概念指的是實體的存在。舉例來說，當我們斷言小明是膽小的，我們就是斷定了有小明這一個實體存在，而膽小則是小明這個實體的屬性。\n\n**實體是支持屬性的基礎，沒有了實體承載，屬性便會因為無所依附而消失。** 屬性則是多變，但無論小明是英俊還是變得醜陋，還是同一個小明。不過衍生一個問題：若人要進行認知行為，那到底是認知了該物的實體還是屬性呢？阿奎那認為**實體與屬性是互相依賴的，我們不能認識無實體支撐的屬性，也不能認識無屬性依附於其上的實體。**\n\n# 形式與質料\n\n若要研究實體與屬性的概念，阿奎那首先必要回答到底實體是由甚麼東西構成，於是阿奎那引入了亞里士多德形而上學第二組概念，即**形式與質料**。以一棟房子為例，房子的長、闊、高是規定房子的形式，而磚頭與木料等是屋子的質料；實體即由形式與質料兩者構成。不過**形式與質料之間的角色位置不是固定不變的，較高一級的東西相較於低自己一級的東西是形式；較低一級的東西相較於高自己一級的東西是質料。** 例如比較房子和磚塊，房子是形式，磚塊是質料；而比較磚塊和紅土時，磚塊是形式，紅土才是質料。[（參見：亞里士多德（上）：傳承．邏輯．本體）](http://bit.ly/2c3bRus)除了角色位置可以隨高低層級而變化，阿奎那亦認為在**形式與質料之間存在運動的變化，質料本身可以通過獲得形式而由潛能導向實現。** 由此，便引入亞里士多德形而上學的另一組概念，即潛能與實現。\n\n# 潛能與實現\n\n**質料如果沒有被形式所規定，它只是純粹的潛能。質料可以通過被形式所規定，慢慢實現自身的潛能，走向實現。** 若以紅土作為質料，經過設計，紅土成為磚塊；而磚塊又進一步被利用來蓋房子，變成宏偉的建築物，如此一來，最初作為質料的紅土便不斷獲得規定，自身慢慢變得豐富和複雜起來。那麼質料能否完全實現自身，由純粹潛能走向純粹實現呢﹖阿奎那認為**只有神才是純粹的形式和純粹的實現，在神自身之內沒有絲毫尚未實現的潛能。**\n\n於是乎**整個世界便由最高的、純粹形式和純粹實現下降至最低的、純粹質料和純粹潛能組成的層級，萬物介於最高與最低之間，不斷努力由潛能走向實現。**\n\n# 五路論證\n\n阿奎那探討眾多亞里士多德形而上學概念後，便著手探討以此為基石試圖論證神的存在。由此，阿奎那便提出了著名的五個論證，即著名的 **「五路論證」(Five Ways)** 。\n\n第一路論證關於事物的運動，稱為**不動的推動者論證(The Argument of the Unmoved Mover)**。阿奎那認為從潛能到實現需要外物的推動，一物被另一物所推動，另一物又被另一物所推動，如此類推。然而我們無法設想一個無限序列的推動鏈條，所以必定存在一個自身不被推動而能夠推動別物的推動者，阿奎那認為這個不動的推動者就是神。\n\n第二路論證是**第一因論證(The Argument of the First Cause)**，是關於事物的動力因。動力因是亞里士多德「四因說」(doctrine of the four causes)中的一個原因。例如，一所房子得以存在，是出於建築工人利用建築物料所建成，其中建築工人的建造就是動力因。一物要被產生，需要一個比自己先在的外物所施動，而另一物又需要另一個比自己先在的外物所施動。然而我們不能設想一個無限序列的動力因鏈條，反而必然要設定一個第一動力因，阿奎那認為這個終極動力因就是神。\n\n第三路論證是**偶然性論證(The Argument from Contingency)**，以偶然性與必然性來作推論。從日常生活中，很多事物都會被產生而後消失，這些事物在阿奎那看來都是屬於偶然存在。可是如果世界沒有必然存在而只有偶然存在，那麼世界就有可能有某個時刻是所有東西都不存在。另一方面，無亦不能生有，所以我們必然要設定一個必然存在，而這必然存在就是神。\n\n第四路論證是**程度論證(The Argument from Degree)**，從事物屬性的程度以證神。我們經常說一個東西比另一個東西好、一個東西比其他東西善。阿奎那認為當我們使用這些概念時，實際上是以相對於某個最高程度的事物而言的。例如當我們說小明是善，但另有更善者比小明更善。在阿奎那看來由於比較事物時總會有更好或更善的事物，這蘊含了必定有一個最高程度的善存在，而那個善當然就是神。\n\n第五路論證是**目的論論證(The Teleological Argument)**。阿奎那認為在世界中，我們隨處可以發現事物的發展總在趨向某個目的，例如種子生長的目的趨向變成花朵。阿奎那認為雖然在世界中存在很多不同種類的事物，彼此有不同的發展目的，但它們卻能共同配合，構成一個和諧的秩序，這個和諧的秩序必然是出於神的理智而被安排。\n\n至此，可見阿奎那的哲學關注中心乃是神的存在。阿奎那可以以神為中心建構他的[倫理學](http://bit.ly/2c85Idm)和法學思想。\n\n# 自然律\n\n阿奎那的倫理學和法學思想以神為基礎，解釋在神統治下，人應該如何生活。阿奎那認為神是理性的，但對於為甚麼神是理性的這個問題，阿奎那似乎認為這是個不需要論證而自然會明白的事實。無怪乎人們會把阿奎那歸入**理性神學(rational theology)思想家。\n\n阿奎那認為理性的特徵有四：不變、永恆、普遍和必然。自然法(natural law)則是由理性的神所制訂，故此自然法亦應當具有以上四種本質。**神創造受造物時，同時把自然法刻銘到人的心內，如此人性就是自然法。** 不過人性本身難以認識，相應地自然法亦難以被認識。除此以外，自然法不如人法(human law)和神法(divine law)般是白紙黑字所寫成的法律條文。人法指在人類國家社會中所制訂的法律，後者指神在聖經(the Bible)中啟示的法律，包括舊約(the Old Testament)中的十誡(the Ten Commandments)，和新約(the New Testament)中的耶穌(Jesus)登山寶訓(Sermon on the Mount)。阿奎那因此必然要回答人如何能夠認識自然法的問題。\n  \n阿奎那認為我們有兩種認識途徑，一是通過**理性**，一是通過**良知**。有趣的是常人認為難以認識的自然法，阿奎那卻認為**自然法對於人而言是自明的 (self-evident)；人可以透過理性和良知把握自然法，正如理性能夠把握科學中的公理一樣，良知能夠當下就知道甚麼是應該與不應該。**\n\n總結上述阿奎那在形上學、倫理學和神學等方面的哲學建樹而言，我們足可以把阿奎那視為中世紀時期的「亞里士多德」，他代表了[經院哲學](http://bit.ly/2clw4eT)的發展巔峰。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/Research//Religion/%E9%BD%8A%E5%85%8B%E6%9E%9C%E8%AB%96%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8":{"title":"","content":"tags:

齊克果將人的存在描述成三種不同層次：「感性」、“理性”和“宗教性”（或稱“審美”，“倫理”，“宗教”） 。感性的人或是享樂主義者、或是熱衷於生活體驗的人，他們主觀而具創造力，對世界沒承擔、沒責任，覺得人世間充滿可能。理性的人則是現實的，對世界充滿承擔和責任，清楚明白人世間的道德、倫理規條。因此，有別於感性的人，理性的人知道這世界處處設限，充滿著不可能或疑問。面對不可能和疑問，理性的人就只有放棄或否認，並永遠為失去的東西而悲傷。這個時候，人只有靠著「信仰的飛躍」進入宗教性，用信念的力量戰勝疑問和理性上通常認為是不可能的事。只有信仰，才能使人重獲「凡事俱有可能」的希望。\n  在《恐懼與戰慄》中，齊克果思考[舊約](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%88%8A%E7%B4%84)中「信仰之父」亞伯拉罕聽從神的指示殺子獻作燔祭的故事。他認為如果亞伯拉罕不在乎自己的兒子生死、沒有道德倫理以至親情的心理掙扎，或者認為聽命於神而殺子是一種道德規條，他的所作所為就毫無意義。亞伯拉罕的行動的價值在於他從理性躍進宗教性，信仰神的大能、相信凡事可能、奇蹟會出現（結果神在最後關頭遣天使阻止亞伯拉罕殺死兒子）。齊克果認為，不通過理性的話，是不會有信仰的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0bj22c1wxdm22fvdm2hqc))\n- 絕望階段\n  祁克果於其著作《[致死的疾病](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%87%B4%E6%AD%BB%E7%9A%84%E7%96%BE%E7%97%85)》中，認為絕望是不接受自己不想要的自我或固執於現狀的自我、最終“**失去自我**”，認為這也就是基督教所講的原罪。絕望的人不一定知道自己絕望、也不一定感到痛苦。最低層次的絕望在無知的人，一心只知世俗物事;這類人沒有自我意識，不認識自我的永恆性，更不知道自己陷於絕望。另一些人意識到自己為渴望得到某些世俗物事而絕望，但仍沒有自我永恆性的意識。另一些人開始意識到自我、永恆性，也意識到自己為世俗物事而絕望的軟弱，為此他們也就不願接受這個自己，結果陷入另一種絕望。再進一步，一些人決定接受軟弱，聽天由命，承認自己的永恆性。進而，他們要願意接受當前的這個自己。他們可能選擇靠著「信仰的飛躍」重獲希望，脫離絕望;可是他們也可能選擇視絕望為最終真理，將自己置於永恆的絕望中。\n  於是，人在不同存在層次也就有不同的絕望。感性的人為世俗物事而絕望，理性的人也就為拒絕自我或選擇視絕望為最終真理而絕望。信仰是脫離絕望的唯一方式，選擇信仰也就是實現自我的唯一法門。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0bvsjm158019926ez241y))\n- 他認為每個人對所處環境都有巨大的責任，雖然世界不斷在演進卻仍不能把人解放出來。而所謂「本真的存在」（authentic exist）是指有自由意志的個人，會向善或向惡作決定。而在決定的時候，因為人是有限的，所以焦慮和失望的產生是可預期的。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0ek6x1kb6arcxfynddf28))\n- 這一類的焦慮有兩方面：一方面，是「無法實現」的焦慮，因為受到限制，而有不能實現自己的焦慮。另一方面，是想要實現自己和害怕實現自己的雙重焦慮。而這裡所談論的亞當不是指原來歷史上的亞當，而是指存在我們每個人中的亞當。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0eywtv6r8rgttq0jkx3q7))\n- 齊克果的信心的跳躍是談到當人面臨抉擇的時候會引發焦慮，而這種決定是一種跳躍的動作，它無法用邏輯方法來推演。齊克果認為人的墮落也是一種非理性的跳躍。然而另有一種跳躍，就是信仰的飛躍，同樣不能從處境中推演出來。當人面臨致死的疾病或是無法克服的焦慮，信仰卻能幫助人克服。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0gvscx4esywzxvmm0sc1q))\n- 在齊克果的理論中，信心的跳躍有三個階段，但是這些階段不是時間上的那種階段，而是包含美學的、倫理的和宗教的，這三階段彼此間相互聯繫，無法清楚分開，例如在最後的宗教階段裡，仍不免存在倫理思想和美感。尤其是他認為倫理宗教是具有主觀性的，是源於他獨特的審美觀，而美感卻不能用邏輯來推理。而上帝是所有行為與思想的終極前提，因此更無法用推理與邏輯證明上帝的存在。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0mfh3b8721qv1e3yn3xqn))\n- 美學階段的特徵是與人的生存扭在一起，他在這裡所談到的美學不是指美學這門課程本身或藝術，而是一種衡量的標準。標準是按照每個人和每件事是否能夠滿足自己的美學，也就是聖經中描述猶太人對於好的事情或正確的事情，就稱這事為善、為美的「美」，這就是屬於美學的階段。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0nx32b83j22zbn7js92s1))\n- 在倫理階段，齊克果提出「魔性的」（demonic）這一個概念，是「自我隔離」（self- seclusion） 的意思，也就是沒有走出自己。跟這種自我隔離的情況相反的是愛，愛可以引導人走出自我隔離的處境，也就克服了「魔性的」。這種愛的特徵可以引導到愛的關係。也就是說在倫理階段中，愛克服了孤立進而產生責任心，而透過責任心就可以達到倫理的階段。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0pzbwkbjgc60af92pc8th))\n- 齊克果主張「主觀的真理」，為新正統神學奠定了哲學根基，重新尋找神話語的神學，將信仰置於崇高的地位，只把理性當作是理解神話語的工具而已。就是因為神話語中的基本真理具有弔詭性，使得邏輯學的[非矛盾律](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E9%9D%9E%E7%9F%9B%E7%9B%BE%E5%BE%8B\u0026action=edit\u0026redlink=1)（A≠-A）在基督教神學也不管用，因為神的意念（思想）高過人的意念（思想），神的道路（方法）超過人的道路（方法）。 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpv0sg3m0bq6hm3r0jrtbvtf))\n- 齊克果對於真理的定義，特別是關乎神與人類存在的真理，是指「一個客觀不明物，人透過內心最深的熱情去攫取，並且將它緊抱不放。」但是，「當主觀、內在是真理，客觀定義的真理就成為弔詭。」道成肉身就是一個「絕對的弔詭」，所以只能憑著信仰披露與理解。

act of to be itself 01:00another way to state that in aquinas is god is that reality unique absolutely unique in which essence and existence coincide to be god is to be to be those are all ways of talking about what we mean by god they are kind of gnomic and that's on purpose there's almost a zen koan kind of quality about the way we talk about god i'm saying something that's substantive but

to say in god essence and existence coincide is to say god's very nature is to be and that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world so what i'm doing there is i'm i'm gesturing the way the

same as god's uh active to be but now what does that mean i'm not quite sure because nothing in our ordinary experience corresponds to that everything in our experience is is a being of some type so

我一直喜歡阿奎那，他說我們使用的關於上帝的語言是類比的，所以它不是，不是單一的意思 我說的那個東西，你知道，或者關於這個瓶子，我可以說關於上帝 不，這讓上帝成為一個實體，同時它不是簡單的等價交換 所以如果我說那個東西是和上帝是，我是指完全不同的東西，不，我指的是類似的東西，所以神就是存在，所以存在的真正含義是神的存在，那個東西或這個東西的存在，或者星系或亞原子粒子的存在都與神的存在方式類似，所以在這個基礎上，我可以做一些陳述，我可以理論化，甚至在你建議的極限，我可以想象，所以我們有神的隱喻，聖經中充滿了這些權利 上帝是一塊石頭 你知道上帝就像一頭獅子 上帝就像這樣那樣 或者聖經有時會把上帝想象成一個人走來走去 你知道現在只有粗糙的原教旨主義會說 這是對上帝的普遍準確的描述 這是一個形象，抓住了上帝的存在方式的一些東西\n  our knowledge begins always in this world begins in ordinary experience 04:00but i think we can through metaphysical analysis through philosophical reasoning can come to some knowledge of a reality which is transcendent to our experience so we gesture toward it i always like aquinas who says the language about god that we use is analogical so it's not it's not univocal meaning what i say about that you know can or about this bottle i can say about god no that makes god an entity at the same time it's not simply equivocal so if i say well that thing is and god is i mean 04:30totally different things no no i mean something analogous so to be god is to be to be so the real meaning of being is the being of god the being of that thing or this thing or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles would be analogous to god's manner of being so on that basis i can make some statements i can i can theorize and even at the limit as you suggest i can visualize so we have metaphors for god and 05:00the bible is replete with those rights god is a rock uh you know god's like a lion god's like this and that or the bible will sometimes imagine god as a as a human being walking around you know now only the crude fundamentalism would say well that's a universal accurate description of god it's an image that's

we mean by the incarnation the incarnation of the son of god becoming a creature in such a way as to make humanity radiant and beautiful that's the pillar of christianity it's the incarnation you know um 16:00and what follows from that is the redemption of of all of reality so not just of human beings but in becoming a creature god divinizes the world you know the greek fathers always said god

所以我試圖解釋，比如說阿奎那的運動因果關係，你知道最終性，我可以用自然原因來解釋，這不就足夠了嗎？ 所以我覺得，當自然主義者說話的時候，或者是那些純粹的唯物主義者，他們就會說，不，那是完全足夠的，對現實的科學解釋是完全足夠的。所以我會偷著樂，說好吧，告訴我為什麼我們需要更多的東西。 要做到這一點，你必須走出柏拉圖的洞穴，在我看來，因為我對自然主義的反對意見是，它是停留在立即可觀察到的經驗領域，犯了一個錯誤，說這就是存在的全部，這就是需要解釋的全部，而在我們進入宗教之前，就停留在柏拉圖，走出洞穴的第一步。如果你現在把它和線的寓言結合起來，就是數學對象 我和那些說數學是對非物質的體驗的人一樣，我已經走出了一個單純的經驗性的物理自然主義世界 當我理解一個純粹的數字或純粹的方程式或純粹的數學關係時，它將在任何可能的世界中獲得，而不與空間和時間相聯繫 這就是走出洞穴的第一步。這導致了更多形而上學的反思 例如對自然界的反思 我是說，我可以把這個東西作為一個物理對象來談 我可以在各種層面上分析它 跟著所有的科學家 你知道的，在這個東西上上下下，很好 但是我仍然在柏拉圖的洞穴裡 我仍然在看墻上閃爍的圖像 但是當我走出洞穴，進入數學領域 我就進入了一個不同的存在境界\n  can we just explain everything through natural causes why would you have to invoke a cause beyond the causes in the world so as i'm trying to explain let's say for aquinas motion causality you know finality can i just do that with natural causes wouldn't that suffice to explain it so i i get like when naturalists are speaking or people that are pure materialists they'll just say no that's perfectly adequate a scientific account of reality is utterly adequate to our experience um so i would steal man that and say well show me why we need something more and to do that you got to get out of plato's cave it seems to me because that my objection to naturalism is it it's staying within the realm of the immediately empirically observable and making the mistake of saying that's all there is to being that's all there is that needs to be explained and long before we get to religion just stay with plato the first step out of the cave if you combine it now with the parable of the line is mathematical objects and and i'm with those the many people that would say mathematics is an experience of the immaterial i've stepped out of a merely empirical physical naturalistic world the minute i understand a pure number or a pure equation or a pure mathematical relationship which would obtain in any possible world which are not tied to space and time that's the first step out of the cave and then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections for example on the nature being i mean so i could i could talk about this thing as a physical object and i can analyze it at all kinds of levels and follow all the scientists you know up and down through this thing and fine fine but i'm still in plato's cave i'm still looking at the flickering images on the

這種關係有一種非常奇怪的神秘感，你知道，我會說這是因為你進入了一個更高層次的存在，它包含了一個更低層次的存在，這就是柏拉圖式的方法，當你移動時，我將用不同的比喻，你移動到更高的層次，他們包含了更低的層次。\n  i just came across it recently and discovered this whole literature around it is eugene vigner's article in 1960 called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics to the physical sciences i think that's the title of it or effectiveness or something like that yeah but what's so cool is you know he's not a religious man he was a kind of a secular jew but yet he uses the word miracle like eight times in that article and because he just is so impressed by the fact that high complex mathematics describes so accurately the physical world and can be used to to create things and to manipulate and why should that be true that there's something very weirdly mysterious about that relationship you know and i would say it's because you you stepped into a higher order of being which is inclusive of a lower level of being that's the platonic approach is that as you move now i'm going to different metaphor you move to higher levels they're inclusive of the lower levels

所以它與一個獲得性的頭腦相對應 所以亞奎那可以說，可理解的制定是智力和行為的意思 在這和那之間有一些深刻的對應關係 我同意Vigner的觀點，我認為這很奇怪，不合理，也很奇怪。 我的答案是，因為宇宙的創造者是一個偉大的頭腦，他給世界打上了智能的烙印。 起初是一個詞，對，這個詞和上帝在一起，所有的東西都是通過這個詞產生的，我們不應該把它想象得那麼好。\n  one of the arguments for god is based on the intelligibility of the world this very it's like vigner it's very peculiar fact it seems to me that the world is so radically intelligible why should that be true why should it be the case that being has this intelligible structure to it so it corresponds to an acquiring mind so aquinas can say that the the intelligible enact is the intellect and act meaning there's some there's some deep correspondence between this and that and it's i'm with vigner that's i think really weird and unreasonable and strange now my answer is because the the creator of the universe is a great mind and uh has stamped the world with intelligibility uh in the beginning was the word right and the word was with god and all things came to be through the word don't we shouldn't picture that so much it's a it's gesturing in this very powerful direction there's an intelligence that has imbued the world with intelligibility and and we discover that

但第二它是絕對的 在每個角落都是可理解的 這兩個概念與創造的概念相關，所以它是被創造出來的，它不是上帝之外的上帝，但它的每一個維度都被上帝的思想所觸及。 當這兩件事都到位了，科學也就開始進行了。\n  the condition for the possibility of the of the western physical sciences was a basically christian idea namely that the world is not god therefore i can i can analyze it experiment upon it i can i don't divinize it i don't have a mystical relationship to the world it's not god but secondly that

level in regard to jesus what i mean there is for kant jesus it's not so much the historical jesus this figure from long ago it's jesus as an archetype of the moral life you know he says he's the

我一直覺得神話表達和新約之間的區別在於它讀到了像卡爾-瓊和受他影響的約瑟夫-坎貝爾這樣的人，還有現在的喬丹-皮特森，他們都非常聯合，對經文進行了這種典型的解讀，我是說我認為這非常有趣。有很多事情要做，但有一種平靜的感覺，比如說，是的，有趣的，在這個文化和那個文化中，它是道德生活的形式，我理解所有這些，然後你讀新約，不管那些人在談論什麼，他們不是在抓住 他們不是抓住你的肩膀，搖晃你來吸引你的注意力，告訴你發生在他們身上的事情，對嗎？ 就像復活，關於神的死亡和復活的神話，以及那是多麼強大的力量，塑造了我們的意識，這很吸引人，這不是新約，新約是你聽說過嗎？上帝讓他從死裡復活，500人看到了他，彼得也看到了他，最後我也看到了他，這就是保羅的說法，不是獨立的。\n  it always strikes me the difference between let's say mythic expressions and the new testament is it read someone like you know carl jung and then joseph campbell whom he influenced and now jordan peterson was very union and this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures and great i mean i think it's very interesting and there's a lot going on there there's a sort of calmness though about it like yeah the interesting and that's in this culture and that culture and it's the form of the moral life and i understand all that then you read the new testament uh whatever those people are talking about it's not that they are grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking you to get your attention to tell you about something that happened to them right like the resurrection the myth of the dying and rising god and how powerful that is and shaping our consciousness that's fascinating that's not the new testament the testament is did you hear did you jesus of nazareth whom they put to death god raised him from the dead and he was seen by 500 and he was seen by by peter and and and then lastly i saw him that's how paul talks it's not the detached you know um psychologist amusing on archetypal things and i think that makes a

historical details are essential here so if you you know if you look at hitler and nazi germany it's not enough to say well power corrupts and sometimes so looking at the archetype of hitler it's much much more important much more powerful to look at the details of how he came to power yeah what are the ways he did evil onto the world and then then you can get really intense about your struggle with some of the complexities of human nature and power on institutions and all that kind of stuff so the historical nature of the bible we're in historical religion and we've been it's important

我認為了解聖經的最好方法是把它看成一個圖書館，而不是一本書，所以它是一個書籍的集合體，來自不同的時期，不同的作者，不同的讀者，不同的體裁，所以在聖經中你可以找到詩歌，找到歌曲，找到類似於歷史的東西，不是我們意義上的歷史，而是類似於福音，是他自己的體裁。你會發現福音書，這是他自己的體裁 你會發現像保羅那樣的書信文學 你會發現世界末日的東西 聖經裡有這麼多東西 那麼聖經是不是真的是上帝的話語呢？\n  i think the best way to get at the bible is to think of it as a library not a book so it's a collection of books right from a wide variety of periods different authors different audiences and different genre so in the bible you find poetry you find song you find something like history not in our sense but something like history you find gospel it's his own genre you find uh epistolary

亞裡士多德說只有一小部分有財產的男性和受過足夠教育的人 亞裡士多德說只有一小部分有財產的、受過充分教育的男性 才應該參與政治生活 其餘的都應該參與私人生活 有些人適合做奴隸 所以他把我們大大地劃分開來 西塞羅也是如此 這是從哪裡來的這種奇怪的想法，我們都是平等的 我想這是什麼呢？ 我想在這個小詞中特別體現了殘餘的東西 所有人都是平等的 這就是我們的平等 我們都是上帝的孩子 所以把上帝排除在外 我想我們會迅速滑向不平等的懷抱 現在在古典世界是的，但他看看20世紀 我的意思是，當上帝被系統地排除在外時 我想你會看到權利和平等被瘋狂地中止 所以我認為上帝在畫面中是非常重要的 我們是上帝下的國家，這非常重要 這不是虔誠的廢話，而是我們民主的理性基礎\n  the other thing i find really interesting is equality because um look in classical philosophy political philosophy plato aristotle cicero it's not equality for them it's our inequality that's really interesting so plato divides us into these three classes and aristotle says only a tiny little coterie of property males of sufficient education should be in the political life the rest should all be in private life you know and then some are suited for slavery so i mean he divides us dramatically same with cicero and so on um where does this come from this weird idea that we're all equal i mean how we're not equal in beauty not equal in strength we're not equal in moral attainment we're not equal in intelligence so what is it and i think the residue especially comes through in that little word that all men are created equal that's our equality that we're all equally children of god so take god out of the picture i think we are going to slide rapidly into an embrace of inequality now in the classical world yes but heck look at the 20th century i mean when god is excluded in a very systematic way i think you saw the suspension of rights and the suspension of equality like mad so i think it's very important that god is in the picture and that we're a nation under god it matters enormously that's not pious boilerplate that's at the at the rational foundations of our democracy

當我們超越了善與惡，你知道的，剩下的只是權力的意志，那麼為什麼我們會驚訝於強者的崛起，他們為自己的目的少用權力，當我們忘記了平等和權利這樣的想法，這些都是以上帝為基礎的，為什麼我們會驚訝於死亡營的出現，所以我認為這之間肯定有關聯。\n  much of the totalitarianism of the 20th century follows from that um that questioning of god and the dismissal of god from from public life so i i would be sympathetic with that um when we're beyond good and evil you know and all that's left is the will to power and then why are we surprised that the powerful rise and that they use the power less for their purposes when we forget ideas like equality and rights which are grounded in god why are we surprised that that death camps follow so i think there's a correlation there for sure ([Time 1:29:35](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e6777e558811000905472c))\n- \u003e 現代科學從其狹隘性中獲得了力量，我的意思是，他們幾乎完全包圍了亞裡士多德意義上的形式和最終因果關係，他們專注於有效和物質因果關係，正如我所說的，這給予了巨大的力量，但來自於焦點的狹隘性，但對亞裡士多德來說，更重要的原因是最終和形式原因，所以最終因果關係吸引了我們\n  the modern sciences drew their strength from their narrowness and what i mean there is is they almost completely bracketed formal and final causality in the aristotelian sense and they focused on efficient and material causality and that gave as i say great strength

What he means is that God is not an all powerful/all-knowing being outside of history but is instead life itself. \"God,\" Caputo says in *[On Religion](http://www.amazon.com/Religion-Thinking-Action-John-Caputo/dp/041523333X)*, \"is a name we put on Love.\" Other names we put on love include justice, mercy, joy and goodness.\n  God, then, is not a force who acts on the world through coercion, violence or the suspension of physics and free will. Instead, God is something that we participate in. God is a verb, an action we bring to the world to make love, justice, mercy, joy and goodness known. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtt9dk7tz8vgdazf8p9h742))\n- The God who is a verb or a name for love does not extend beyond the personal God so many have held onto.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttdwytetqcqf55gkq483x6))\n- Remember we said that God is an activity; something that we make happen in the world, and as such is not contained to our religions but is present whenever a person enacts love, justice, mercy, joy and goodness?\n  If God is a verb, then so is worship. The future of the church will not turn on our new theologies but on how we pray and whether our prayer is rooted in an action and activity. Can we honestly say \"body broken for you\" over the bread if we don't address how the world and church contributes to the breaking of bodies? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttg1p0hbcefwfr5cb0xbw1))\n- The church -- which may not be a church as we know it but a study group, a 12-step style program, a distributed network spread across a city or even the world -- of the future will be a place where we celebrate the work of justice we have done and are sent back out to make God known. The church will be the place where we invite atheists, Muslims, Jews and the whole of humanity in and announce that, when we work from Love to make the world a better place, we all engage in the same thing. There is no line between the atheist and theist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtth510qsx5aphr3ngpvzk9))\n- But then again the early Christian community called themselves The Way. A way indicates a path we walk, narratives we ponder and question we ask. It is telling that they did not call themselves The Answer. Following a way is an action. It is a verb. It is making God known because God is not far away and all-powerful but is instead something we make real in the world.

There is something which is wrecking your life, and is ruining you. The thing is you, you are the thing. Now, the problem with that is that the last message 54:30anyone wants to hear.

Virtue is human's tool to beat our innate time preference. Virtue has to stand the test of time and apply across one's lifespan and generations. Real virtue applies across time and helps men survive.\n\nThis is why the right to tell the truth (free speech) is crucial to men's survival. Lies allow one to get away with trouble and manipulate reality, but reality will always win. Telling truthful and useful words is ultimately a better strategy to live in a long term and a better idealt to aim for.\n(https://youtu.be/ABZtZpNtY60)\n\nThe same applies to consumer goods and design. This is where Dieter Rams come in.\nOut of his 10 principles for good desing: \"Good design makes the product useful\", \"Good design is unobtrusive\", \"Good design makes a product understandable\", \"Good design is honest\", \"Good design is long-lasting\", \"Good design is environmentally-friendly\", \"Good design is as little design as possible\", many of them accentuate the importance of being useful, truthful, long-lasting, sustainability, and humility. \n\nIn search of good designs that stand the test of time, you understand how modern consumerism has changed people's focus for living a virtous life by principles that stand the test of time, instead now we're encouraged to get the newest fanciest thing that uses shocking design language and gimicks to get people to pay for something they don't want nor need.\n\nSustainability as a virtue should not focus on minimizing our impact on the environment, but establishing a lifestyle and moral living that allow us to live and flourish on this planet for as long as possible. We are not the cancer to the earth and our existence is not meaningless. We are moral animals and all have the capability of living a virtuous life, if we figure the system out and set our aim right.\nRef: [[個人德性的意義與責任]]\n\n\n\n# Some thoughts after reading [[We Wrestle Not With Flesh and Blood, but Against Powers and Principalities]]\n\n- The concept of Lindy has it's utility, not because what has survived for a long time will be granted a some longer lifespan, but becuase in our effort of understanding the \"WHY\" of certain things standing the test of time - the principles, the philosophy, the thinking behind, and when and why it knows what old things to abandon and what new things to adapt - we can more safely and reasonably predict what will also work in the future when technological changes happen.\n- Take books for example. \n  First we should humbly assume we do not understand the old texts that've survived the history of vast/multiple technological changes (such changes being the most important), and do our best to interpret it in the way that make sense both in present days and the past. We should not blindly assume it'll survive the NEXT technological revolution, but dig in to its **principles for survival** to determine if it'll still survive the next tech change. \n  If a book - be it 2000, 20, or 2 years old - contains knowledge that can be reasonably interpreted and implemented across time, or, can reasonably explain / be used to explain things that happened then and are happening now, we can safely assume it must has grasped some fundamental thinking that will probably continue being useful for explaining the things that're about to happen with the succeeding technological changes. On the contrary, if a newer book suggest the latest things to be good only according to its current face value and does not explain the principles behind the thinking well enough to also explain the things that come before that, it's probably not worth reading because the methodology did not set out to stand the test of time.\n  So this is the reason an old book that's still be printed today should be carefully and humbly read and understood, but without blindly believing it must be applicable for the next upcoming era - it probably might (more so than most other books released this year), but we can never be sure.\n- We can also look at it from a software-update/technological-advancement point of view. \n  We should very careful in identifying the **features** and the **principles** in work in our current time and in the past. It's also crucial to understand how **hardware**, ie state of technology, suspends/prolongs/disables/enables the **software**, ie trending cultural/political/ethical (even) believes, and even updates it or creates new ones.\n  So instead of being completely reactionary, thinking that traditional values/ethics/politcs (ie good ol' days) is better, or even fighting to bring it back (which is probably a universal nostalgia at best), we should strive to think about, pinpoint, and communicate the working principle/philosophy that underly the given time and space (state of technology) and try to extract the principles from the features, so when the next technological advancement comes, we'll have the working principles that allow us to design and promote the new / updated features that'll work in the next state of technology, instead of holding on to the old feature that simply will not work in the next era.\n  So in a real software sense it's like, we should strive to understand why Windows 3.11 works (and works very well) given the state of technology, the design principles behind the its features and functionalities, what it was maximizing/optimizing for / oriented toward, and WHY it might or might not still matter for the next version of Windows. With such understanding, can we safely, knowingly, and confidently move forward to the next version, knowing (not full well, but well enough) how to navigate with the latest state of technology like the advancement of face recognition, AI, wireless connection, touch screens, etc, and orient ourselves toward the right goal so it's totally okay for us to abandon the older OS for the newer, better (in some sense), more suitable (for our state of techology) one.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//Tech/%E6%95%B8%E5%AD%B8%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E7%9A%84%E7%8F%BE%E5%AF%A6%E8%A7%A3%E9%87%8B%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%A5%87%E7%95%B0%E9%BB%9E":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref: \nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%A5%87%E5%BC%82%E7%82%B9\n\n---\n在數學模型到達奇異點的意義可以通過進化模式階梯（Evolutionary Paradigm Hierarchy）來解釋。這個階梯強調**數學是最宏觀的集合**(This mirrors what Roger Penrose said in [[Roger Penrose - Is Mathematics Invented or Discovered]])，而物理是數學的一個子集，而化學則是物理的一個子集，生物則是化學的子集，生物圈則是生物的子集。接下來，人類不同地區的文化是生物圈定義出的子集，而政治又是以文化為基礎指法規，最後人類的經濟活動是由政府的法規所規定。\n\n這個階梯強調**從宇宙誕生以來，篩選就不斷的進行**，能量首先以三維空間的形式出現，定義了宇宙的數學基礎，而萬有引力、強交互作用、弱交互作用、電磁力，還有其他未知的物理常數在三維空間的基礎上定義了能量在宇宙中的物理屬性，而通過這些物理屬性，產生了一百多種元素，而在這些元素中，只有少數幾種像碳原子這樣的原子構造了生物學，在幾億年的生物進化中才造就出人類。又由於每個人類文明所處在的生物圈不同，從而產生了不同的文化和科技進步的速度。而**人類的科技進步速度增快的意義則是人對這個階梯上越來越宏觀集合上的掌握**。**第一步是發現更為宏觀項上基本定理**，即牛頓的萬有引力、達爾文的進化論，**第二步是開始有足夠的實力去改變自然界原有的定理**。所以，可以把人類歷史的發展看成是發現的時代和創造跟改變的時代兩階段。自工業革命以來，我們其實已經進入第二個階段。\n\n該理論的有趣論證是，**在一定的時間內有些事情一定會發生**。也就是說，人類或早或晚都會發現基本的定理，不管是否由歷史上已經出現的偉人們完成。進入第二個階段以後，發現仍然繼續，但是發明創造成為更為重要的活動。而發明的總的步伐會是倒著往回爬階梯。在後工業時代，人類已經基本上征服和控制生物圈，甚至已經在破壞，全球暖化就是非常好的例子。接下來，人類或人類發明的機器逐漸掌控生物本身，基因科學的發展成為一個很好的例子，然後是化學、物理和數學。**最後，人類的科技有可能突破到三維空間以外的地方以其他的方式表達能量的存在**。甚至，能量本身是否作為最基本的表現形式也值得懷疑，可能能量本身也是某些東西的一種表現形式而已。但是**階梯的概念描述了未來人類的發展方向、科技在人類生活中扮演的越來越重要的角色，以及每一次控制能力升級以後所帶來的極大的對更小子集掌控與最佳化。**\n\n如果把科技描述成一種不斷突破各種世界中存在的限制的機制的話，而接近最頂端的數學限制又是建立在邏輯基礎之上，那麼**邏輯本身也就是一種限制**。也就是說**時間本身也是一種限制**。如果，能夠突破時間的邏輯限制，那麼我們應該生活在未來人類創造的世界裡。話說回來，我們是未來人類的始祖，但是未來人類又是我們的創造者。或者說，**最初製造宇宙大爆炸的前因和突破時間限制而可以看到過去、現在和將來所有可能的未來無限科技進步的智慧型是同一個人，或者說我們無法區分開來他們**。有趣的是，如果時間機器確實在未來被製造出來，我們為什麼無法在現在遇見他們？這是霍金已經提出過的問題。但是，事實上，**如果科技奇異點發生，那麼未來人類早在宇宙誕生時就在觀察宇宙的進化**。他們無須也沒有興趣去看望某一個時段人類。因為一切像劇本一樣被事先排列好了。而**我們現在的存在則證明了科技奇異點在未來發生**。甚至可以說，**未來的人類為了封鎖與古代智慧型的交流而製造了時間，而時間在任何的參照系中都不能看到未來，從而躲避古代人類的追問**。所以，我們甚至可以說，**我們自己就是未來智慧型所創造的活化石**。\n\n科技奇點的出現似乎預測時間將會終止。在科技奇點到來前的幾秒鐘時間內，所有可發現的東西都將被發現和利用。無限接近科技奇點的時候，似乎所有能夠用來調動的能量將被呼叫完。以電腦自動機理論的論點來說，這個智慧型可能會控制所有能量的變換，停止計算。但可能仍然在高維空間計算能量變化。甚至在無理數維度上計算能量，所以時間仍然在某些空間中執行。通過這個觀點，可以**把宇宙想像成一個能量逐漸被整理成絕對最佳化的一個過程**。\n\n# 批評\n科技奇異點的論證並非嚴密。僅僅從電腦科技正在加速度發展，就得出科技奇異點的發生，推理上不嚴密。\n\n事實上，不少科技領域已經長期處於科技瓶頸難以突破，並不能持續指數增長，例如民用核融合發電站、常溫超導體、高能量密度且安全的電池科技……。在理論方面，超越標準模型的物理理論與實驗不符，已令相關研究陷入困難。此外，一些新科技雖然是很厲害的創新，但因為不符合經濟適用原則反而被淘汰，如超音速客機、太空梭等。\n\n《經濟學人》曾嘲笑科技奇異點這個概念：按照這個說法，因為剃鬚刀的刀頭在歷史上數量不斷增多，那麼最終，剃鬚刀的刀頭數量會增加到無窮多個。","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/Research//Tech/10-Rules-for-Understanding-Innovation":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟩 \naliases: \nref: https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203091655036928\n\n---\n- # 1.

Innovation is often Serendipitous\n\n\t- Neither the founders of Yahoo! Nor those of Google set out in the search of search engines. The founders of twitter were trying to invent a way for people to find podcasts.\n\t  It is a well-known attribute of innovation: accidental discovery.”\n  \n- # 4. Innovation is Recombinant\n\t  \n\t- “Every technology is a combination of other existing technologies.\n\t  The inventors of the motor car did not have to invent wheels, springs or steel.”\n\t  \n\t- “Recombination is the principal source of variation upon which natural selection draws.\"\n\t  \n\t- Innovation happens:\n\t  -“when ideas have sex”\n\t  -“in places where trade and exchange are frequent”\n\t  -in populated areas \n\t  \n- # 5. Innovation involves Trial and Error\n\t  \n\t- “During the early years of a new technology - the railway, for example, or the internet - far more entrepreneurs went broke than made fortunes.\n\t  Innovators who just like playing around are more likely to find something unexpected.”\n\t  \n\t- “Edison perfected the light bulb not by inspiration but by perspiration: he and his team tested 6,000 different materials for the filament.”\n\t  ‘I’ve not failed, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work’ - Thomas Edison \n\t  \n- # 6. Innovation is a Team Sport\n\t  \n\t- “The myth of the lonely inventor, the solitary genius, is hard to shake.”\n\t  [it] always requires collaboration and sharing, as exemplified by the fact that even the simplest object or process is beyond the capacity of any one human to understand.” \n\t  \n\t- “One person may make a technological breakthrough, another work out how to manufacture it and a third how to make it cheap enough to catch on. All are part of the innovation process and none of them knows how to achieve the whole innovation.” \n\t  \n- # 7. Innovation is Inexorable\n\t  \n\t- “People seem to stumble on the same idea at the same time. \n\t  In 1922 Ogburn \u0026 Thomas at Columbia Uni produced a list of 148 cases of near-simultaneous invention by more than one person..\n\t  Simultaneous invention is more the rule than the exception.”\n\t  \n\t- “Many ideas for technology just seem to be ripe, and ready to fall from the tree.\n\t  It was impossible for search engines not to be invented in the 1990s, and impossible for light bulbs not to be invented in the 1870s. They were inevitable.”\n\t  \n\t- “The lesson this teaches..[is] the individual is strangely dispensable. \n\t  Maybe things take longer, have a slightly different look and get different names. But the innovations still happen.” \n\t  \n\t- “Technology is absurdly predictable in retrospect, wholly unpredictable in prospect. Thus predictions of technological change nearly always look very foolish. \n\t  Anticipating what people want is something innovators are good at; academics less so.”\n\t  \n- # 8. Innovation’s Hype Cycle\n\t  \n\t- “Amara’s Law states that people tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short run, but underestimate it in the long run.” \n\t  \n\t  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5y0wZyVcAEETe-.jpg) \n\t  \n\t- “We expect too much of an innovation in the first ten years and too little in the first twenty, but get it about right looking fifteen years ahead.” \n\t  \n\t- “I suspect that the Amara hype cycle can be detected today in the story of artificial intelligence, a technology whose promise has long disappointed. Thanks to graphics chips, new algorithms and lots of data, at last AI might be on the brink of not fading away.”\n\t  \n- # 9. Innovation Prefers Fragmented Governance\n\t  \n\t- “One of the peculiar features of history is that empires are bad at innovation. \n\t  Though they have wealthy and educated elites, [they] tend to preside over gradual declines in inventiveness, which contribute to their eventual undoing.” \n\t  \n\t  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5y0wuUUcAYeERU.jpg) \n\t  \n\t- “The Ottoman and Mughal empires managed to ban the printing press for more than three centuries. \n\t  This was an unholy alliance: the calligraphers defending their monopoly in cahoots with the priests defending their religious monopoly, by successfully lobbying the authorities” \n\t  \n\t- “As time goes by and the central power ossifies, technology tends to stagnate, elites tend to resist novelty and funds get diverted into luxury, war or corruption, rather than enterprise.”\n\t  \n\t- “For at least a thousand years, innovation has disproportionately happened in cities, and especially self-governing ones. \n\t  ..infrastructure scales at a sublinear rate, but the socio-economic products of a city scale at a super-linear rate.”\n\t  \n- # 10. Innovation increasingly means using fewer resources rather than more\n\t  \n\t- “Those who say that indefinite growth is impossible, or at least unsustainable, in a world of finite resources are therefore wrong, for a simple reason: growth can take place through doing more with less.”\n\t  \n\t- “More food from less land and less water; more miles for less fuel; more communication for less electricity; more buildings for less steel; more transistors for less silicon; more correspondence for less paper..” \n\t  \n\t- “In the ten years from 2008, America’s economy grew by 15 per cent but its energy use fell by 2 per cent.\n\t  It’s because of economies and efficiencies created by innovation.\"\n\t  \n\t- “It will always be possible to raise living standards by lowering the amount of a resource that is used to produce a given output.

It serves these values by affecting material outcomes, such as preparing fields for agriculture. The plow would also lead to urban fortifications for storing and protecting food surpluses, and thus change the nature of human habitats, warfare, and architecture. The plow favors men as farmers due to the upper body strength needed to use it, which changed ideologies about the respective value of the sexes. The plow led eventually to certain forms of animal domestication, in the long run altering the relationship between humans and the natural world, and thus moving religious beliefs from animistic to theocentric. Normalization of animal-drawn plowing as the basis of agriculture made it difficult for humans to value animals as sacred and as equal or surpassing humans in worth. It is hard to worship the sacred spirit of an animal that must be beaten all day to pull a plow. Dominion over animals in this way justified the spread of a cultural narrative that humanity’s role is to control nature, rather than to be a part of nature, which laid the foundations for a mindset that eventually resulted in the industrial revolution. These and countless other changes to human minds, behaviors, and culture followed from the invention of the plow.

It is important not to consider any technology as existing all by itself.

It is also values altering: technologies change and augment existing value systems. These two dynamics are related but not deterministic.

The rapid emergence and saturation of digital technologies—largely based upon fast-paced nihilistic design—has resulted in what might be called an *accidental planetary computational stack.*[[15]](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-15) This means that the technological environments we find ourselves in, with their visible and invisible effects on our bodies, minds, cultures, societies, and ecosystems, did not result from design.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbt82xyfyv2vr1h8ccqnp5z))\n- Finally, we must seek to clarify the fundamentals of human value systems. It is vital that we factor how psychological processes work in conjunction with technology to change human meaning-making and valuing. Preferable futures require a return to considerations of human nature and conditioning, and how the two interact to influence behavior and thus the experience of being human. These human-making dynamics are an unavoidable part of the consequences that flow from all innovations. As we have developed incredible new capacities, our history of naive and now nihilistic design has driven civilization into a massively complicated bottleneck of existential consequence. Existing ecologies of technologies and infrastructures must be judged by their effects on bodies, minds, families, cultures, and the environment. Future technologies must be designed according to methods that take human value and experience seriously enough to be constrained by their limits—such as sanity, dignity, and justice. The dangerous reign of nihilistic design must end if our civilization is not to.

I almost have to take a leap of faith and believe that each one of use is made in the image of God, as it sets the very fundamental for our sovereign existence.\n\nTo be valued both by ourselves and by others, is an undeniable instinct we all share and the basis of how we conduct our lives. We like to live as if we're something of value and we like it when others validate that ideas, and others will find us respectful only when we treat them the same way.\n\nFree will or not, we as humans like to live as if we're conscious agency of our being. We certainly don't like to be devalued as if we're merely objects or means to an end, that's when we'll feel used, taken advantage of, lied to, and betrayed.\n\nAlmost universally, the ideal life we can possibly imagine for ourselves consists of something involving appreciation and care from our family, validation and recognition for our work, cherishment and love from our partners, and affirmation and respect for ourselves. This is the very instinct we live of, and the ideal we live towards.\n\nSo it's undeniable that one of, if not the very thing we want in our life, is to be valued as a human being, in whatever way we individually desire. Being valued as an individual can give us tremendous meaning and help us get through significant amount of hardships, which is why the voluntarily adoption of responsibility is one of the quickest way to cultivate drive and meaning for your life.\n\nThis is why in our daily life, we should not only view ourselves as individuals as values and not accept ourselves to be used (to be enslaved by other's emotions or actions), but should also be wary not to reduce any person's individuality down to his/her look, race, gender, opinion, action, and belief. As tempting as it is to do so, by fighting this lazy and irresponsible attempt to reduce people into less than who they are and dehumanize them, we form a much stronger basis for public discussion, social affair, mutual understanding, genuine and trustful interaction on all levels. This is a moral pillar for a strong and stable society.\n\nSo this leads us to why watching porn is wrong - and I'm mainly talking about the act of watching people have sex for one's own pleasure - is because this act is equivalent to exploiting the performers for one's own usage and reduces them to merely objects for certain means. Watching porn is not wrong because sex and body are sinful, but this the very act we should avoid as it's wrong in and of itself, whether or not the performer likes it or if it's hurting anyone.\n\n透過色情片來理解自身性偏好及性生活的人，會深深地內化「一切都是以我為中心」的訊息，無論看色情片的人怎麼做都沒辦法改變這點。而當他們找到可能成為他們人生伴侶的人時，他們會缺乏正確的觀念去建立起真正的人際關係。- [[Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World]]\n\nAnd so there's no more dangerous idea than what some people might think 'humans as parasites on earth'. Such view might come from the care for the environment as well as the pessimistic view for humanity, but it's nonetheless a catastrophic idea. Such idea is not only not helpful (should we just line people up and shoot them? tell people to quit having children?), but itself degrades the value of the person promoting it, which is why it's catastrophic - it's an idea that can bring demise to the very person withholding it. And that's precisely what many mass shooter did - when one REALLY believes there to be no value in humanity and its existence, the most logical act would be to kill as many people as possible before one commit suicide\n\nThat leads us to suicide. Imagine the ideal life we talked about where your value is appreciated, now consider the opposite direction, where a person is totally not valued. Despite there're many other complex reasons why people lead to suicidal thoughts,\n\n...The very suicide attempt is the doing (direct result) of the circumstances in which the person is not valued, so the only real self-conscious decision in the midst of it would be to stand up and live as if you're a valuable individual. Do not let the whole self destructing circumstance consume you into nothingness, which is what the darkness of this world can sometimes do to people.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JQKZsfy_YdM\n\nKey foundation that pro-life arguments are based on: Value of a living being (human) is based on the potential (human-ness) that one possesses, not on whether one can express that fully at a given moment.\n\nThe same can be said to those with brain damage (or even brain dead) or seriously ill. People will do what they can to hold on to these loved ones in the hope of them being well again - to realize the potential of being a human in this world again. It seems somewhat illogical or cruel to disregard that part of a embryo just because it hasn’t have the chance to prove its capacity of human-ness and establish a relationship with anyone, yet.\n\nHowever, how do we determine which potential is greater? The mother’s potential without carrying this unwanted child, or the potential of both of them living, or even the potential of the child at the expense of sacrificing the mother’s life if needed? In different period of the human history we seemed to have different answers, and I’m not so sure how to answer this one at this moment, and I’m quite certain this answer is unanswerable.\n\nFor the most part I’d still suppot a society with minimal interference of people‘s live from the government and I do not trust governments for achieving greater goods for most citizens (as I do believe in the sovereignty of individual‘s choices) and I do want to stay away from authoritarian regime of most kinds. I’d still propose a free, libertarianism socieity with minimal interference from the governments but with high moral standards of the people - having the shared sense of responsibility of the people goes hand-in-hand with the optimized freedom.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research//The-wrong-measure-for-all-things":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌿 \nlinks: [[科技]]、[[金融]]、[[道德]]、[[哲學]]、[[道德]]、[[能源]]、[[]]\nRef: \n[[個人德性的意義與責任]]\n\n---\n\n(How our lives in the 20-21st century can possibly be viewed as a total mistake/detour from the right direction in later centuries when people look back with their re-gained moral knowledge and holistic worldview.) \n\n- Technological thinking\n  ref: [[Daniel Schmachtenberger - Bend Not Break Part 1 Energy Blindness]]\n\tPeople are overly optimistic about technology being able to solve pretty much all the problems we face, in fact technology creates just as many - if not more - problems than it solves.\n\t\n\tPeople are too optimistic about technology for a good reason - technology has indeed been immensely improving for the past few decades, however that's merely based on the fact that we discovered the carbon pulse that fuels pretty much all the globalized technological advancement.\n\t\n\tHowever, being this optimistic about technology really only serves as a placebo, as it seems there's no other way around many of the economical and environmental issue we face, unless all of us voluntarily / involuntarily downsize/de-grow our economy and lifestyle, which is certainly not considered an option for those who already enjoy the technological brilliance they have in their daily lives. It's simply too hard to let go, so instead they just put their faith in tech for solving the issue and sustaining our current lifestyle.\n\t\n\tOur latest technological advancements have mostly been dopamine-driving machines that fuels our desires for more tech itself, instead of substantial effort in resolving the issue at hand. It is also clear that our recent technological advancements have not been very efficient in uniting humans as a global community and helping us see the bigger picture for the challenges we face, instead it's been extremely efficient at dividing us by feeding our tribalism by stimulating our emotional reactions - all of which is driven by the wrong metrics that our current economic model uses for measuring success.\n\n\n\n\n- Reductionist/Atheistic thinking\n\u003e ref: [[Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World]]\n\n- Economical/Capitalistic thinking\n  \u003e ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q23wwyksdY\u0026t=1687s\n\n\tThe meaning of things is measured by their economical output. \n\t\n\tThis blinds people from seeing what's truly important, when those things are just self-evidently important in common sense.\n\t\tThis is how people neglect environmental preservation, work ethics, corporate's social responsibility, labor force issues, people's wellbeing, etc.\n\t\tHence the lack of acknowledgement from the liberals on the importance of motherhood, which is clearly a productive and immensely important job. I believe they only neglect motherhood's crucial importance because they're blinded by the economical glance that distorts what truly matters.\n\t\t\n\tEconomical thinking can drive ideologies and industries that simply don't work as first principles (e.g. Hippocratic Oath - \"Do no harm\"), rather it only satisfies large corporate and industry's economical gains. \n\t\tThis is basically how the whole modern-day pharmaceutical industry works.\n\t\tIt also drives governmental intervention for the market which creates just as many  - if not more - problems than it solves, only to achieve a certain GDP growth to satisfy the voters.\n\t\tEconomical thinking essentially drive the shortsightedness of the globalized consumerism culture and democracy, shortening people's time preference.\n\t\n\tEconomical thinking is basically an extension of what Fromm's called people being \"marketing personality\".

Love IS an exchange when done right, and it can be a healthy one. on the contrary, when a love has nothing exchanging between 2 people, it can often times leads to suffering\n\nimagine your spouse one day becomes 植物人, as much as you love her, you'll not be able to love her the way you used to when she's able to love you back, in the way that this love can manifest in the world as very tangible things and expressions.\n\nthe love you give someone when they're able to love you back, is simply different from the love you can give them when there'll be no response.\n\nThe definition of love goes both ways, even if it's only coming from one person.\n\nso selfless love, in which the person giving the love lose/forget about himself in the loving, often leads to frustration or ever resentment when this love is not responded accordingly.\n\nThat's why in toxic and abusive relationships, one will suffer endlessly even if she loves the other person so selflessly and want nothing to him, while the other person continues to abuse and use her.\n\nThat's also why when you're dealing with your teenage child and giving him all the love you can but he's responding in coldness, you'll grow resentful even if it's your own child.\n\nYou do not want to love someone selfless, at least not for the most part in your life. Love goes both ways, and you definitely want to love (/treat) someone (properly) in a way that it's more or less possible for the other person to love (/treat) you back (properly).\n\nIn a selfless love, there's no self, no caring for oneself, and that's a big mistake, because you can be very likely loving in a way that is not caring for yourself, or even not honoring yourself as a sovereign individual.\n\nSo when you love someone, definitely beware whether you're loving and caring about yourself in this love you give. We live as social animals, and we want to love others in a way that it's likely that they'll love us back. This is a crucial part of our relationship with the community, and determine our wellbeing in each of our relationships tremendously.\n\nIn this life, we want to learn to love and to be loved, and we want both at the same time. You want to take care of yourself while caring for others, because as much as you love the next person, you should always start with loving yourself.\n\nYou need to see yourself as a valuable individual in order for your love to have value to others, instead of letting love rule over you and letting yourself become a slave to any relationship. It's not a proper way to treat yourself by letting yourself become a slave to any relationship, and it's not a proper way to love someone else by letting them become the tyrant who rules over you in the name of love, whether that person is doing this consciously or not.\n\nWe want to live in this cycle of love where we love and can be loved back. That's the healthy balance we should aim for, not the 'ideal' selfless love that only lives in fantasy but simply doesn't work in the real life.","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.352043115Z","tags":null},"/Research/Readwise/In-Search-of-the-Third-Attractor-Daniel-Schmachtenberger":{"title":"","content":"tags: #🗃/🟥 \naliases: \nref:

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0m0af4nnwnc69ca5m6bp2))\n- Even a technology as simple as the plow is created with values in mind, such as ease of labor, speed of work, and a desire for food surpluses that create a feeling of safety. It serves these values by affecting material outcomes, such as preparing fields for agriculture. The plow would also lead to urban fortifications for storing and protecting food surpluses, and thus change the nature of human habitats, warfare, and architecture. The plow favors men as farmers due to the upper body strength needed to use it, which changed ideologies about the respective value of the sexes. The plow led eventually to certain forms of animal domestication, in the long run altering the relationship between humans and the natural world, and thus moving religious beliefs from animistic to theocentric. Normalization of animal-drawn plowing as the basis of agriculture made it difficult for humans to value animals as sacred and as equal or surpassing humans in worth. It is hard to worship the sacred spirit of an animal that must be beaten all day to pull a plow. Dominion over animals in this way justified the spread of a cultural narrative that humanity’s role is to control nature, rather than to be a part of nature, which laid the foundations for a mindset that eventually resulted in the industrial revolution. These and countless other changes to human minds, behaviors, and culture followed from the invention of the plow.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5whys1xy9qwmy753bhgvkn))\n- *Luddite* approaches often looked backward, trying to rescue forms of life that were being overthrown by a range of technological encroachments.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5wm5ph8jpmmcqwkmg9z214))\n- As modernity advanced, science gained in power, and technological innovations increased, there arose a form of ***nihilistic design***: design that effectively ignores value as an aspect of technology-human interfaces. This approach might also be called *values agnostic design*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5wsp1rqtgk8z5akdqtr19s))\n- The philosopher of technology, Langdon Winner, described aspects of this view in what he called the “Technological Orthodoxy.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5wqv3xbtw2svvy98g9p68t))\n- “Technological orthodoxy” entails a strict separation of values from technology. In part, this is related to understanding value itself as primarily socially constructed. This idea began with modernist scientific materialism. The assumption that physical matter constitutes all that exists leaves no room for “subjective qualities” such as value. This idea—that value is purely subjective—reached its climax with postmodernist expressions of skepticism towards all universal frameworks of value. The result has been a progressive deepening of the separation of technology design from considerations of value. Thinking about design in this way leads innovators to “move fast and break things” and focus effort on “disruptive” technologies. Whereas naively optimistic design made the assumption that technology could advance sacrosanct values, nihilistic design decoupled technological innovation from any serious considerations about value at all. The consequences of this approach are likely to be both far-reaching and difficult to understand completely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5wvy70yhj7dpzq0vpyqkct))\n- As a way forward, we propose here a form of ***axiological design***: design that factors and leverages the intrinsic values inevitably encoded in all technology-human interfaces. This is design that acknowledges that in addition to whatever its physical impacts, it is also affecting the behaviors and thus the psychology of the people using it (and with proliferation, the society as a whole). As such, technological innovations must have design goals and constraints related to the psychological and sociological effects as core elements of the design process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5wxt1qy9j0cze896tca5az))\n- Instead of assuming technology is either good or bad by definition, technology should be understood as intrinsically value laden and value creating. All technologies are created with the actualization of certain values as a goal; they are embedded with values from the start. As technologies take hold and proliferate, they should be understood also to have the potential for forming new, unknown, and unpredictable values. Technologies are both encoded forms of human values and at the same time encode potential and unknowable new values, for better and for worse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5wzj2bzejktwf8v16af2zx))\n- Technologists have promoted a range of overlapping approaches including (but not limited to) user-centered design, usable design, human-centered design, value-sensitive design, worth-centered design, ontological design, and more.[[10]](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-10) Some of the insights and conclusions from these fields are summarized in the following five propositions about technology: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs5xb2709sw1hs245adpz9c4))\n- • Technology is created in pursuit of values, and results in the creation and transformation of values.\n  • Technology requires the creation of more and different technology; multiple new technologies evolve together as functionally bound sets, forming evolving ecologies of technologies.\n  • Technology shapes our bodies and movements as a human-created habitat, and thus is deeply habit forming, both for individuals and societies.\n  • Technology changes the nature of power dynamics in unpredictable ways, creating an environment that advantages some humans over others, setting up selection pressures that force personal adaptation to and adoption of new technologies.\n  • Technology impacts the kinds of ideas we value, the quality of attention we pay, and our conceptions of self and world.

Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.364043089Z","tags":null},"/notes/4":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n## Docker Support\nIf you don't want to use a hosting service, you can host using [Docker](notes/docker.md) instead!\nI would *not use this method* unless you know what you are doing.\n\n---\n\nNow that your Quartz is live, let's figure out how to make Quartz really *yours*!\n\n\u003e Step 6: 🎨 [Customizing Quartz](notes/config.md)\n\nHaving problems?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T14:21:39.36804308Z","tags":null}}
