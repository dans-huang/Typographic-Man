{"/":{"title":"Add Lightness","content":"# what is lightness\n\nIn the context of design and engineering, \"lightness\" refers to the reduction of weight or mass in a product or structure without compromising its strength, stability, or performance. Lightness is often sought after because it can result in greater efficiency, improved performance, and reduced resource consumption, while still maintaining or improving the quality and durability of the product.\n\nFor example, in the automotive industry, \"adding lightness\" has been a guiding principle for many high-performance sports cars, with automakers using lightweight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase speed and handling. In the aerospace industry, reducing the weight of aircraft and spacecraft is critical for efficiency and safety.\n\nIn design, lightness can also refer to the appearance or perception of lightness, even if the actual weight or mass of the object has not been reduced. For example, a product with a minimalist or streamlined design might appear \"light\" and unobtrusive, even if it is physically heavy.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.646689002Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E4%B8%BB%E5%8B%95%E8%BF%8E%E5%90%91%E7%97%9B%E8%8B%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%84%8F%E7%BE%A9":{"title":"主動迎向痛苦的意義","content":"#📝️/🌿 \n\nI think one of the most important findings  in the last few years in neuroscience is that, while the molecule dopamine is associated with reward, it's more about motivation and craving\nThere's a really classic experiment now that  people use to demonstrate this take two rats  and the rats independently separate cages can  lever press for food or when they can access food\nthere's a little bit of dopamine that's released  anytime they get some food so we always thought  that food like many other rewards like food sex  warmth when you're cold cool when you're too warm  is triggering the release of dopamine \nbut someone  had the good idea to deplete dopamine in one of  those animals and then what you find is that the  animal without dopamine still enjoys food still  enjoys other pleasures \nso **dopamine is not really  involved in the enjoyment of those pleasures  it's involved in motivation because if you make  the animal have to move just one rat's length  believe it or not to get to that lever the animal  with dopamine will work to go get that thing it  will work through some effort to go get the reward  \nwhereas the animal or turns out the human without  much dopamine can still experience pleasure they  can sit on their couch and cram their face with  pleasure inducing calories or what have  you watch pleasure inducing things on the  television but they have very little motivation to  go pursue things that will deliver them pleasure**  \nit's actually **what's really driven the forward  evolution of our our species, has been the desire  to go seek things beyond the confines of our  skin.\nwhen i say the common currency is  dopamine, what i mean is the molecule dopamine - when secreted in the brain - makes us pursue things, build things, create things, makes us want new things that we don't currently already have, and so it has a lot of dimensions to it. \nbut rather than think about dopamine as a signal for reward - like a dopamine hit we classically think and talk about - it's more accurate to think about dopamine as driving motivation and craving to go seek rewards** \n**and  it's a way of tabulating where we are in our life**  are we doing well or are we doing poorly and that  happens on very short time scales like you wake up  feeling good or do you wake up feeling kind of low  \nor on long time scales if you're halfway through  a long degree or you're halfway through your life  how are you doing how do you gauge that well it  has everything to do with how much dopamine you  were releasing in the previous days and weeks and  years \nso you're always comparing and all of this  is subconscious \nbut what's cool is that **once you  make these processes conscious once you understand  a little bit about how dopamine is released and  how it changes our perspective and our behavior  then you can actually work with it** and \nso  we go back to this example the person that's  not motivated that can't get off the couch  that doesn't want to do anything well this  is the problem \nthey are effectively the rat  with no dopamine but they can still achieve  some sense of pleasure by consuming excess  calories by consuming social media and \nlook i'm  not judging i do this stuff too right scrolling  social media \nif you've ever scrolled social media  and you're like i don't even know why i'm  doing this it doesn't really feel that good  \nand i can remember a time where you'd  see something it was just so cool or you  see something online i remember this when ted  talks first came out i was like this is amazing  these are some at least some of them are really  smart people sharing really cool insights  and then now that they're like a gazillion ted  talks \ni remember spending a winter in my office at  when i was a junior professor cleaning my office  finally and binging ted talks in the background  thinking this is a good use of my time pretty soon  they all sucked to me i was like this isn't good \nso what you need to do is stop watching Ted talks for a while, wait and then they become interesting  again and that's this pain pleasure balance\nand  \nso for people that aren't feeling motivated, the problem is they're not motivated. but they're getting just enough or excess sustenance, so they're getting the little mild hits of opioid - it becomes an opioid system. \nif you think  about the opioid drugs as opposed to dopamine / dopaminergic drugs,\ndopaminergic drugs make people rabid for everything: drugs of abuse like cocaine, amphetamine make people incredibly outward directed, or they hardly notice anything except what they want more of - one more, more. it's  very bad because those drugs trigger so much  dopamine release that they become the reward - it's  very circular. the only the drug can give that  much dopamine, nothing they could pursue would  give them as much dopamine as the drug itself. so  there's that. \n\nand then there's the kind of opioid like effects of constantly indulging oneself with social media or with video games or with with food or with anything to the point where it no longer evokes the motivation and craving.\n\nand **this is really the new evolution of the understanding of dopamine in neuro in neuroscience, which is that dopamine itself is not the reward, it's the build up to the reward. and the reward has more of a kind of opioid bliss-like property which itself is not bad if it's endogenous released from within. \nbut when we can just sit there - like the rat with no dopamine - gorging ourselves with pleasures, so to speak, what you end up with is somebody that feels really unmotivated and those pleasures no longer work to tickle those feel good circuits and so there's no reason for them to go out and pursue anything.**\n**the problem is not pleasures, the problem is that pleasure experienced without prior requirement for pursuit is terrible for us.**\nit's terrible  for us as individuals, it's terrible for us as as  groups, and i have great confidence in the human  species to work this out \n\nbut **we are finding  now and we are going to increasingly find, that those who will be successful - young or old - are going to be those people who can create their  own internal buffers.** \n**they're going to be able to  control their relationship to pleasures because  the proximity to pleasures and the availability  is the problem.** \n\nif you look at the increase in use of drug abuse or prescription medication, which at least at the first pass deliver pleasure / pain relief. the whole issue with the opioid crisis and dopaminergic drugs like ritalin adderall - sometimes there's a clinical need - is that tons of people are taking those recreationally  now or to study huge dopamine increases are what  those cause \nthat is a problem that's a serious  problem because it creates a cycle where you you  need more of that specific thing \ni always say  **addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure**\ni don't  like to comment too much on enlightenment because  you know i don't really know what that is as a  neurobiologist but \n**a good life - we could say - is a progressive expansion of the things that bring  you pleasure and even better is a good life is a  progressive expansion of the things that bring you  pleasure and includes pleasure through motivation  and hard work** \n**and understanding this pain-pleasure  balance, whereby if you experience pain and you can  continue to be in that friction and exert effort, the rewards are that much greater when they arrive**  \nand so i think that if you look at any drug  of abuse or any situation where somebody  isn't motivated or thinks that now they may  have clinically diagnosed attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder \nbut a lot of what people  think is adhd it turns out is people just over  consuming dopamine from various sources and then  and also the context within a tick-tock feed is  the context switch is insane \nthe brain has never  seen first of all there's the first time in human  evolution that we wrote with our thumbs but that's  a pretty benign shift \nand that the other shift is  normally you walk from one room to another or from  a field into the trees or from a hut into or a  house or whatever it is \nbut now you can get 10 000  context switches in that 30 minutes of scrolling  on instagram or to talk \nand **so it's all about  self-regulation - we are going to select for the  people that can self-regulate** \nand so then people  say well how do you self-regulate how do kids  self-regulate well this is my hope \nand one of the  reasons i've gotten excited about public education  and teaching neuroscience is that \nthis is a place  where knowledge of knowledge actually can allow  oneself to intervene \nwhen you think i'm feeling  low i don't feel good nothing really feels like  am i depressed maybe \nbut maybe you're just you've  saturated the dopamine circuits you're now in the  pain part of things \nwhat do you do well you have  to stop you need you need to replenish dopamine  you need to stop engaging with this behavior  and then your pleasure for it will come back  but you have to constantly control the hinge \nit's  not just about being back and forth on the seesaw  you have to make sure the hinge doesn't get stuck  in pain or in pleasure \nunderstanding that pain  and pleasure in this really dynamic balance  can also help us which in the following way  \nany pain that you feel the longer day the less  sleep the the kind of agony that things aren't  working that power outlet doesn't work  or the internet is slow whatever it is  \n**the amount of pleasure that you will eventually  experience is directly relation related  to how much pain you experience** \nso we know this  from actually what nowadays would be considered  quite barbaric and unethical experiments  where they would give people electrical shocks  and they would measure their response and then  they'd say we're going to increase it we're  going to increase it \neventually they get to the  point where a slight shock that was previously  very painful actually evokes a sense of pleasure  now you couldn't do these experiments anymore  these are not the experiments i do in my lab and  these are older experiments \nbut for instance i  and this has been discussed in scientific research  papers uh giving somebody a like a ten minute ice  bath for instance or even a three-minute ice bath  or a one-minute ice bath it's quite painful \nbut  there was a study from the university of prague  uh european journal **physiology showed that  after a painful ice bath stimulus the amount of  dopamine release goes up for two and a half hours  to 250 percent above baseline \nand that's not  because the ice bath itself evokes dopamine  release** - a lot of people think oh cold water of ox  dopamine release no - \n**pain evokes dopamine release  after the pain is over** \n\njust understanding **the more  friction and pain that you experience the greater  the dopamine reward you will get later and that  serves as its own amplifier of the whole process  of pursuing more dopamine** \n\n**so the keys are to  pursue rewards but understand that the pursuit is actually the reward if you want to have repeated wins.\n\n**then what you realize is your capacity to tap into dopamine as a motivator not  just seeking dopamine rewards that is infinite**\n\n養大了一整個世代沒有暴露在風險之下、沒有能力駕馭這些事情的孩子，在社會層面上是個尤其悲劇的事。 - [[Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World]]\n\n讓我們從 耶穌意思的反面 開始。 許多人認為\"十字架\"是他們生活中必須 背負 的 重擔： 一段緊張的關係，一份吃力不討好的工作，一種身體上的疾病。 因著自憐的驕傲，他們說，\"那是我必須背負的十字架。\"這樣的解釋並不是耶穌所說的\" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我\"。  \n  \n當耶穌 背 著他的十字架 到各各他被釘死十架時， 沒有人想到十字架是 所背負重擔 的象徵。 對於一個 一 世紀的人來說，十字架意味著一件事 且只有一件事： 人類 可以發明的 最痛苦和最丟人的 死亡方式 。  \n  \n兩千年後，基督徒將十字架視為贖罪、 饒恕 、恩典和愛的象徵。 但在耶穌的 時代 裡，十字架代表的 只有 痛苦的死亡。 因為羅馬人 強制 被定罪的罪犯將自己的十字架 背 到受難地，背十字架意味著他們 背著自己的刑具同時要面對死亡道路上的嘲笑。  \n  \n因此，\" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我\"意味著 為了 跟隨耶穌願意 去 死 。 這叫做\" 向自己死 \"。 這是對絕對 順服的呼召 。 耶穌囑咐 背起十架之後， 他說 ： \"因為凡要救自己生命的 ， 必喪掉生命 ； 凡為我喪掉生命的 ， 必救了生命。人若賺得全世界 ， 卻喪了自己 ， 賠上自己 ， 有什麼益處呢？ \" ( 路加福音 9:24-25; 馬太福音 16:26; 馬可福音 8:35-36) 。 儘管這 個呼召 很困難，但 回報 卻是無與倫比的。  \n  \n無論耶穌去哪裡，他都吸引眾人。 儘管這些人常常 將他 作為彌賽亞 來 跟隨他， 但是 他們對彌賽亞真正的看法——他將會做什麼 —— 被 扭曲了。 他們認為基督 會開闢復興的國度。 他們 認為 他會把他們從羅馬占領者的壓迫 中 解放出來。 甚至基督自己門徒的內部圈子也認為這個王國即將來臨 ( 路加福音 19:11) 。 當耶穌開始教導他將死於猶太領袖和非猶太人 的君主 ( 路加福音9:22) 時，他的聲望就下降了。 許多被震驚的 跟 隨者都拒絕了他。 的確，他們不能 消滅 自己的想法、計劃和願望 ， 而用耶穌的來代替。  \n  \n當生活順利的時候，跟隨耶穌是很容易的 ； 我們對他的真正承諾是在 試煉 過程中顯露出來的。 耶穌向我們 明確，試煉 將會臨到他的 跟 隨者 ( 約翰福音 16:33) 。 門徒需要犧牲， 並且 耶穌從來沒有隱瞞過 這一代價 。  \n  \n在路加福音 9:57-62 ，有三個人似乎願意跟隨耶穌。 當耶穌進一步追問他們時，他們的承諾充其量只是半心半意。 他們沒能計算出 跟隨他的代價 。 沒有人願意 背起 他的十字架，把自己的利益釘在十字架上。  \n  \n因此，耶穌似乎勸阻了他們。 這是多麼 不同於典型的福音 傳道！ 有多少人會對一個叫做\" 來 跟隨耶穌，你可能會 面臨 失去朋友 、 家人 、 名聲、 事業，甚至是你的生命\" 這樣 的 獻祭 做出回應呢？ 虛假轉變之人 的數量可能會減少。 這就是耶穌所說的\" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我。\"  \n  \n如果你想知道你是否準備好 背起 你的十字架，考慮以下問題 :  \n\"如果 它意味著 你 會 失去一些最親密的朋友，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著疏遠你的家 人 ，你願意 跟 隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著你的名譽受損，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著你 將 失去工作，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n\"如果 它 意味著失去你的生命 ， 你願意 跟 隨耶穌嗎？ \"  \n  \n在世界的某些地方，這些後果是 事實 。 但請注意這些問題的措辭，\"你願意嗎？ \"跟隨耶穌並不一定意味著所有這些事情都會發生在你身上，但是你願意 背起 你的十字架嗎？ 如果在你的生活中，你 將 面臨著一個選擇——耶穌或 今生 的舒適——你會選擇哪一個？  \n  \n對基督承諾意味著每天 背起 你的十字架，放棄你的希望 、 夢想 、 財產，為了基督的緣故如果需要的話 ， 甚至是你的生命。 只有當你願意 背起 你的十字架時，你才可以 稱為 他的門徒 ( 路加福音 14:27) 。 回報值得 這一代價 。 耶穌 緊跟他向自己死的呼召 ( \" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我\" ) 之後 ， 是 在基督裡 獲得 生命 ： \"凡 要 救自己生命的，必喪掉生命 ； 凡為我喪掉生命的，必 得著 生命\" ( 馬太福音 16:25) 。\n\n---\nlinks: [[哲學]]、[[基督教]]、[[神經科學]]、[[意義]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nRef: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha1ZbJIW1f8\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E4%BA%8C%E9%9A%8E%E6%95%88%E7%94%A82nd-order-effect":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌱 \nlinks: [[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[Daniel Schmachtenberger Bend not Break Maximum Power \u0026 Hyper Agents  The Great Simplification]]\n[[Technology Is Not Values Neutral Ending the Reign of Nihilistic Design]]\n\n---\n在衡量一項措施或決策時，比較好的方式是要跨越最表層的一階效用（first order effect），思考二階、甚至三階效用。意思是說，我們不僅要考慮當前決定的後果，還要考慮到這些後果的後果。面對其他人做的決策，我們也應該設想他人在做出這些決策時可能蘊含了二階、三階思維，並企圖理解它。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E4%BA%BA%E6%80%A7%E7%9A%84%E5%96%84%E8%88%87%E6%83%A1":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[人性]]、[[政治]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\n[[個人德性的意義與責任]]\n[[個人德性受脈絡所定]]\n\n---\n人類作為理性的動物，我們既能向善、亦可為惡。沒有一個小孩不會欣喜振奮於自己能憑藉雙手去實現的良善和積極性；即便只是幫父母擺碗筷或學會綁自己的鞋帶，那都是微小但無庸置疑的「德行」。但人類也有能力鑄下遠遠沒有任何動物能夠複製的邪惡，無論是源自先天組成、心理創傷、意識形態，或是偶像崇拜、群眾心理、部落主義，都足以導致各種不堪入目的個人或集體的極端邪惡 [1][2][3]。\n\n縱然我們活在安逸舒適的二十一世紀，也不代表我們理當自命清高地滑著手機、把過去一百年的眾多苦難看成我們可以遠遠拋在後頭的歷史軼事、彷彿那些殘酷邪惡盡是一些本質上跟你我截然不同的次等人類所造成的。事實上正巧相反，我們有好理由相信自己和那些巨大邪惡之間相距不遠 [4][5]：你會以為自己是個「好人」，比較有可能是因為你沒有剛好落入那些能輕易使你作惡的情境裡，而不是因為你比那些「壞蛋」高人一等。畢竟，要在你我自己身上找到貪嗔癡慢疑的證據，想必不會太難才對。\n\n無論納粹或共產主義，二十世紀都已經留給我們一個沉痛的歷史教訓：當人類受到盲目熱情、偶像崇拜、部落主義、意識形態所驅使時，我們便可能為其他人類帶來巨大的苦難、實現令人驚懼的惡。這些駭人聽聞的邪惡，都在在提醒著我們永遠不該對人性抱持浪漫的無知，低估任何人——包含你我自己——為惡的可能性，甚至忽略群眾心理和情境條件等足以將好人輕易變成劊子手的非理性因素。凡是為人，都可能在某些不幸的處境下棄善行惡。\n\n但這是否代表我們可以斷然為人類的存在做下結論，相信人類是輕易受到環境制約、被群眾心理支配、樂於追隨熱情而摒棄理性、僅僅是比較聰明卻也製造無數禍害的靈長類呢？我不認為，因為正如Viktor Frankl在《活出意義來》中說的：\n\n\u003e（在納粹集中營裡）光知道一個人究竟是警衛或俘虜，顯然不能據以瞭解此人的性格。人類的同情心，在任何一群人當中皆可發現……善惡的分界線，竟劃過了天下眾生、直抵人性的最深層；即連在集中營中所揭露的深淵底層，亦如此清晰可辨，寧不令人慨歎嗎？\n\n人類在無數劫難中不斷前進、建立更加穩固而安康的社會，我們能走到二十一世紀的今天，本身已是個了不起的成就。今天的人類世界，享有過往的人們遠遠難以想像的安康、富裕、便利、還有生活的可能性，就連此時此刻世界上最貧困的國家，都已經遠離幾百年前人類世界中最糟糕的處境。即便跟許多人受到新聞和社群媒體毒害的世界觀相互抵觸，但其實有大量證據告訴我們這個世界正在變得更好 [6][7][8]。\n\n雖然此刻的人類的確握有前所未有的強大力量、足以帶著整個世界共赴滅亡，更面臨著前所未有的科技、人文、政治、心理的嶄新挑戰，但那並不代表我們該對二十一世紀抱持著悲觀的末日觀點。相反地，當我們深刻地瞭解人類作為一種動物，你我內心深處能夠累積多麼龐大的憤怒、憎恨、傷害他人的意圖；認識到人性的黑暗能引領我們為這個世界創造多少的苦難；並從人類剛在過去一百年內鑄下的種種邪惡去深省……\n\n如果你瞭解自己身而為人能夠承載多大的邪惡，你該接著發現的是，我們睜眼所見的世界卻是充斥了如此多的良善。這簡直就是奇蹟。\n\n當你看見自己此刻身處的世界竟能用如此有效、互信、甚至充滿善意的方式流暢運作，當你每一天醒來這個社會都跟昨天一樣國泰民安、老百姓們一樣為生活踏實努力著，你該明白原來這一切如此得來不易、你該感謝人類整體費了多大的努力才走到今天、你該慶幸自己生在如此幸運的時代，並且謹記歷史的教訓。\n\n人性的潛在之惡，只更凸顯了人心向善的趨力——當這個世界、社會、人與人之間能以和平共榮的方式運作時，幾乎沒有人會拒絕以同樣良善、互惠、有尊嚴的方式投身其中。\n\n更重要的是，我們應該看見自己在這一切當中，如何承擔了同樣舉足輕重的責任。\n\n\n---\n\n註\n\n1.

You have to allow things to go bad or die, so it can also possibly go well and thrive.\n\nA story with only good ending already loses its magic. If one is destined to be a hero, then it takes away half of the STRIVING already. Alan Watts: \"The future you can predict is already the past.\"\n\nOur good comes from God, as its the potential seeded in us, however we're not designed to always be good but free instead, so the potential have all its different ways to manifest, which makes the striving toward God that much more valuable rather than predestined. A plant has its potential to become a giant tree but you need it to happen in the wild where no protection or pre-designed environment can save it from being stroke by a lightning and where everything can go wrong and it might die at any given time, that's how the real potential will shine through the harsh nature and let it grow so large that will humble we mere mortals. It humbles us because its a manifestation of God's good that is stored in every living thing as potential, and the vision of this giant tree truly \"calls out\" to our inner potential for the highest good.\n\nPotential can only be fully fulfilled by freedom, and that's why freedom and individual sovereignty are the most fundamental values for a human society.\n\n---\nlinks: [[理想]]、[[社會]]、[[親職]]、[[道德]]、[[基督教]]、[[儒家]]、[[倫理學]]、[[]]\nref: [[]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E4%BD%BF%E7%8A%A7%E7%89%B2%E6%88%90%E7%82%BA%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[社會]]、[[科技]]、[[貨幣]]、[[金融]]、[[政治]]、[[道德]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[關心「跨期」的道德實踐]]\n[[科技是形塑人類歷史的無形力量]]\n[[個人德性受脈絡所定]]\n\n---\n在之前的文章中，我引用過羅徹斯特大學腦與神經科學部門的助理教授Celeste Kidd所做的「棉花糖實驗」。\n\n\u003e她把一組孩子放在「可靠的」情境下，另一組則置於「不可靠的」情境下。在棉花糖實驗正式登場之前，不可靠的情境下那組孩子會遇到一個不守信用的成人。舉例來說，在上美術課時，成人向孩子保證如果乖乖等一下，他就會拿新的美術用品給她，替換她現有的那盒不堪用的蠟筆。過了幾分鐘，他空手而回。另一方面，可靠組的孩子會遇到信守諾言帶來新蠟筆的成人。\n\n\u003e 可靠情境的孩子表現得和先前棉花糖研究中的孩子差不多，僅有少數幾個孩子很快向誘惑投降，約三分之二的孩子願意等待。不可靠情境的孩子就不一樣了。成人離開以後，有半數的孩子在一分鐘之內就吃掉棉花糖，只有一個孩子撐得夠久而領到第二顆棉花糖。\n\nKidd的發現顯示了，孩子在擁有信任感、相信成人會信守諾言的情境裡，展現較低的「時間偏好 (Time Preference)」、願意推遲眼前甜頭、更具備耐心的德性。\n\n（「時間偏好」意指人們對於短期及長期利益的計算衡量，亦即「及時行樂」與「延遲享樂」間的拔河：時間偏好高，代表人比較短視近利、今朝有酒今朝醉、樂意消費當下可得的好處；時間偏好低，代表人比較思慮長遠、著重未來的收成、能夠推遲眼前的利益。）\n\n同理適用更廣的社會層面上：唯有當人們對於犧牲行為具備信念、相信自己身處在「可靠的」大環境下，才可能降低時間偏好，能思慮未來、關心群體、體現美德。相反地，當維繫這份信念的固有機制（可能是價值觀、科技產品、社會制度等）遭到新發明或觀念的破壞、走向崩壞，人們便可能不再對犧牲行為抱持信念，讓一整代人都更短視更自私，進一步削弱群體中的信任。\n\n於是我們應該認知到，**特定科技或社會機制的發明，能夠大大地促進人們為群體福祉進行跨期的思考**——亦即成為更有遠見與德性的個人——無論作法是刺激人的理性和良知、或者單純讓人們發現這是賽局中的較佳策略。\n\n以下是一些我們清晰可見的實例：\n\n- 貨幣：一種跨越時間空間、以「信任」為核心的價值載體。人們將投入生產或服務的能量（勞力、技術、能源等），透過交易「轉存」進貨幣中，並信任貨幣裡「存取」的能量/價值在另一個時間空間中仍能幾乎等值地兌現成其他產品或服務。\n  \n  當人們信任手上的錢在不同時空中能保持其價值，相信延遲享樂、犧牲當下利益可以換取未來的更好報酬，儲蓄才可能成為合理的理財途徑，刺激人們為長遠、群體的利益思考，企業亦有更高動機去創新、解決未來問題。反之，當人們預期金錢價值在未來可能不增反減，等同變相鼓勵人們趁能花掉時先花掉，形成以消費、借貸、債務為核心的經濟模式（預支未來以成全當下享受，可謂「犧牲」的對立概念），企業也因此被鼓勵提供最能滿足人們當前胃口的淺碟產品與服務。[1]\n\n- 金融：即是人與人的「跨期承諾」，是今天跟未來的價值交換。無論古今，人都會面臨天災人禍的威脅，所以會有透過跟他人做跨期交換的避險需求。一旦涉及跨期承諾，信任就是核心，否則當違約賴帳的機率太高，就不會再有人願意參與跨期價值交換。貨幣是人類最早、最基本、最普遍的金融品項，但借貸、股票、保險、債券等其他方案也都要求著同等抑或更高的信任，方能使「投資」成為可能。[2]\n\n- 法治：談到跨期承諾的兌現，就必須探討如何解決違約賴帳的問題。法律是人類文明賴以維護權益、約定義務的規則體系，使人們對於彼此之間可以和不可以做什麼事情保有清晰的理解，並信任同一套規則也被其他人所採納，違法犯紀的人則會受到相應的懲戒。法治社會為人們帶來一視同仁的約束、使人類行為能有公正的可預期性、進而為人與人之間的跨期承諾帶來保障、也就讓各種犧牲行為有了兌現的可能。金融與法治的相輔相成，讓禮俗宗教等過去被社會長期採用的遊戲規則得以退居次位。\n\n由更廣的層面看，你我生活中許多帶有「犧牲」意含的活動，也都是立基在科技及社會機制所成就的安穩生活條件上。舉例來說，我們投入運動保健的努力，是以當下努力換取未來的長遠安康、或至少降低不必要的風險；我們將教育視為對自己的投資，相信投注時間心力去研習某些專業知識，對於未來發展會有幫助；在道德上，我們大多相信、或多少都用行動驗證了當個正直誠實的「好人」是個好策略，就算有時會不太方便，長期來說也通常對自己、對別人都有比較好的結果。\n\n值得一提的是，在政治學理論中，人們對未來的規劃越長遠，就越會參與政治與支持民主([Mill, 1861](http://www.constitution.org/jsm/rep_gov.htm); [Fowler and Kam, 2006](http://fowler.ucsd.edu/patience_and_turnout.pdf))，因為參與政治的付出是立即的，但是經過長久協商、妥協後的政策產出往往很久以後才會發生，可是也惟有長久的協商創造出的公共領域可以有效的反映民意、監督政府而防止濫權，也因此**耐心**被視為是一種政治德性 (political virtue)，有益民主政治。[3]\n\n由此可見，特定發明所帶來的生活條件，賦予了我們能夠進行跨期道德思考、使「犧牲」成為可能的環境，而人們在這樣的基礎上持續創新、改良、提升生活品質、擴大關心的範圍、推進文明的發展——**科技發展和社會機制對於人們的時間偏好有著直接的影響。**\n\n理解這點，就能理解為什麼國勢衰微會使禮樂崩壞，經濟委靡會讓人民懷念起威權政治，通膨破表會令年輕人失去未來展望。\n\n---\n註：\n1.

But these are all inadequate, because the infinite abyss can only be filled by an infinite and immutable Object, that is to say, only by God Himself.\n\n最近十年來，全球政治的空前紛亂、部落主義的推陳出新、社群媒體的火上加油，都在在顯示了現代人在疏離傳統與宗教後，迫切地需要一個全新的生命託付。帶給人們生活意義的核心事物，從過去的道德、責任、家庭、社群，演變成今日的娛樂、政治、社運、投資、以及其他五花八門的東西。\n\n當然，現代的生命託付絕非只是膚淺和無益的，我也不是主張人們的託付只能是傳統或宗教。然而值得我們謹記的是，當一個人擁有、享受、經歷得再多，內心深處卻仍未獲平靜時，那往往便是缺乏「信仰」的警訊。縱然現代人盡享當代社會的美好安逸，但生命終究是充滿缺憾與不如意的，若我們任由自己停留在「意義真空」中、缺乏對任何核心價值的信仰，我們將難以消受種種生命的考驗。\n\n事實是，人生中能賦予我們最豐富的意義和正面情緒的活動（或之一），便是我們為自己立下一個值得追尋的志向、一步步地朝著標的邁進。許多時候，有沒有抵達終點根本沒有這麼重要。這裡我說的「志向」，不僅僅是一個人在現實層面想要的成就或想望，更多是他內心深處的「心志所向」：他期許如何評價他自己、期許在重要他人眼中成為什麼樣貌的自己、期許自己能做得到或能為社會做到什麼。\n\n而這些深刻的自我追尋，都必須由一個人信仰的核心價值所驅使，足見「信仰」作為生命的基本態度，是通往一個具備絕對意義的人生的起點。\n\n\u003e人活著不能沒有信仰。我們這一代以及後代的關鍵問題在於：這個信仰究竟會成為對領袖、機械、成功的非理性信仰，或者是基於我們自身創造性活動所產生的理性信仰。\n\n---\nlinks: [[道德]]、[[基督教]]、[[意義]]、[[虛無主義]]\nref:\n[[後現代的價值真空]]\n[[對意義的渴望]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E5%BE%B7%E6%80%A7%E5%8F%97%E8%84%88%E7%B5%A1%E6%89%80%E5%AE%9A":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \naliases: 棉花糖實驗、本質主義\nlinks: [[道德]]、[[信任]]、[[倫理學]]、[[時間偏好]]、[[人性]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref:\n\n---\n談到延遲享樂，大概讓許多人想起知名的「[棉花糖實驗](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A3%89%E8%8A%B1%E7%B3%96%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C)」、以及它如何證明了自制力和個人成就的關連性。但不同於多數人的理解，自制力作為個人特質，其實與一個人身處的情境或脈絡息息相關。換句話說，自制力——一如其他的個人特質與德性——在你我身上絕非只是訴諸命定、「有或沒有」的是非題。\n\n無論是否有意識到這點，多數人都傾向相信性格和道德是與生俱來、難以改變的。當鄰居小孩被逮到順手牽羊偷了便利商店的糖果，我們會直覺地認定他的道德有瑕疵，並從此對他產生戒心、相信他還會再偷別的東西。同樣的觀點讓我們把非常高、甚至不符現實的道德標準套用在名人或政治人物身上，相信如果一個人在私生活的特定面向上不正直，他就肯定是個全盤道德淪喪的人，不容許模糊地帶。更不用說「可是我的個性就是這樣」就是個許多人為了逃避改變和現實、善於灌輸自己的自我限制信念 (Self-Limiting Belief)。\n\n將個人特質和德性視為非黑即白的是非題，即是所謂「本質主義」的人性觀。\n\n本質主義在人性詮釋上的錯誤，在於它沒把一個人所處的情境和脈絡列入考量。一九二零年代，一個針對八千名學童個性的大規模調查[1]，指出多數人在道德上都展現了極低的一致性：有個女生在改自己的考卷時動了手腳，可是在負責派對遊戲的記分工作時卻很公正；有個男生考試時作弊，偷抄另一個同學的答案，可是他在改自己的考卷時卻沒使詐；有個孩子在家偷錢，在學校卻不偷。\n\n這顯示了像正直、仁愛、合作、拘謹、固執等個性，往往都是一個人在特定情境下的固定習性，但非普遍特質。在不同情境下，一個人展現的品格與德性仍可能是截然不同的，而這也對於一個「好人」為什麼可能成為惡魔[2]——比如納粹集中營裡向人施暴的獄卒——提供了完善的解釋。\n\n自制力也是相同的故事。在棉花糖實驗點出了「願意等十五分鐘得到第二顆棉花糖的孩子，未來的現實成就普遍較高」這個本質主義式的關鍵論點後，便有神經科學家著手研究大腦中與自制力相關的結構及如何影響它、兒童心理學家開發課程讓家長用以增進兒女的自制力、教育專家熱切地提出能激發自制力的品格教育方案、社會大眾則危言聳聽著彼此的孩子可能正承擔失敗人生的風險。\n\n然而，現任羅徹斯特大學腦與神經科學部門的助理教授Celeste Kidd，在進行了她自己的棉花糖實驗後，得到了與本質主義論點徹底相反的結果：\n\n\u003e 她把一組孩子放在「可靠的」情境下，另一組則置於「不可靠的」情境下。在棉花糖實驗正式登場之前，不可靠的情境下那組孩子會遇到一個不守信用的成人。舉例來說，在上美術課時，成人向孩子保證如果乖乖等一下，他就會拿新的美術用品給她，替換她現有的那盒不堪用的蠟筆。過了幾分鐘，他空手而回。另一方面，可靠組的孩子會遇到信守諾言帶來新蠟筆的成人。\n\n\u003e 可靠情境的孩子表現得和先前棉花糖研究中的孩子差不多，僅有少數幾個孩子很快向誘惑投降，約三分之二的孩子願意等待。不可靠情境的孩子就不一樣了。成人離開以後，有半數的孩子在一分鐘之內就吃掉棉花糖，只有一個孩子撐得夠久而領到第二顆棉花糖。[3]\n\n實驗顯示了，在擁有信任感的環境裡，孩子會顯露出比無法信任他人的孩子更高的自制力。Kidd的結論是，自制力雖然看似個人的基本特質，但其實仍受脈絡所定。\n\n事實上，假如我們關心相關的數據，會發現類似的例子在我們日常生活中隨處可見：在排隊買咖啡時打手機簡訊，會讓你不小心點了熱量比較高的摩卡奶昔；一整天沒吸菸的癮君子，狂吃冰淇淋的機率卻大增；光是「考慮」捐錢給慈善機構，就會提高人們上街購物犒賞自己的欲望[4]——這些例證，都在在顯示了我們的「自制力」幾乎總是被情境和脈絡所牽制，許多時候我們根本無法「靠自己」做出正確的抉擇。\n\n---\n註\n\n1.

goal]]\n[[個人的價值階級]]\n[[神聖個人概論]]\n\n---\n**每個人肩上都背負著神聖不可取代的道德重任**。\n\n每一個人的周遭都有個他可以直接影響的圈圈，這個圈圈裡包含了他的家人、朋友、同事、以及任何他能接觸到的人。一個人在每一天醒來時，他都可以做一個決定：決定他今天是否要為這個圈圈裡的安康負起責任，或是要在他觸手可及的範圍製造更多不必要的苦難。這關乎他今天是否敬業地面對工作、是否友善地對待朋友、是否溫柔地關懷家人，或者做出完全相反的事。\n\n我們每一個人在每一刻都承擔著這個責任、都面臨著這個抉擇，我們或許無法對社會的整體福祉有直接的貢獻，但我們能決定性地影響我們周遭人們的安康，而每一個小圈圈的安康，最終會累積成整個社會的安康。\n\n今天當一個人將自己的生活打理好、或一通電話跟父母報告自己最近工作的順利時，就足以在他所能直接影響的圈圈裡創造更多的鼓舞和動力，在乎他的人便可能因此少一分擔憂、空出多一分心力去照顧其周遭亦需要被照顧的人。相對地，如果一個人任由生活頹廢、對一事無成的自己不加以鞭策，他的怠惰委靡只會感染和拖累身邊的人，也讓在乎他的人因此擔心憂慮，這麼做等於是將所有他能接觸到的人們一起拖向更糟糕的境地。\n\n當然，一個人或許沒有辦法在當下就使周遭的一切好轉，生活更不可能總是順心如意、必有挑戰與磨難，但我們可以決定的是，要用悲苦無助的姿態承受生命之重，還是拿出勇氣與尊嚴來承擔。縱然一個人身在苦難之中、完全無力改變現狀，我們選擇去承受苦痛的姿態也足以帶給身邊人們截然不同的感受和動力，這點在人們深受病痛所困時尤其顯著，也正是你我都不可能逃避的生命課題。\n\n是以，每一個人都為身邊人們承擔著這份舉足輕重的責任，每一個人都能夠選擇要致力為周遭帶來更多的安康、抑或是更多不必要的苦難，而你帶給身邊人們的東西，必將被其他人用同樣的方式擴散出去。你的一言一行總是以非常實際的方式牽動著整個世界走向更好或更壞——這就是為什麼作為一個神聖的個人，無論你如何看待自己，你都是個擁有絕對價值的存在。\n\n---\n**道德，就是關於「應然」的知識、是個人所信仰的「絕對」價值、是指引生命的準則和理想。**\n\n人要能生活，就必須對言行事物有一套區分緩急的優先次序。 如果你的次序與他人的次序無法對齊，便會產生衝突、嫌隙、焦慮、自我懷疑；當你的次序與他人的次序相似或一致，便能夠為他人創造價值、為自己創造意義，並**在混沌中建立秩序**。人類是社會的動物、總是尋求與他人的連結，故根本不存在所謂的「不被任何人理解也沒關係」的生命意義——那應該要叫生命意義的失落。\n\n所以，**承認道德的重要，就是承認人需要一套可以倚賴的言行準則，就是承認秩序之於生命意義的必要性，更是承認存在著某種值得人努力達到、而且每個人都有能力一步步靠近的生命理想。** \n\n當你能夠謙卑地、日復一日地努力省思並修正自己的言行，你必將看見自己龐大的道德潛能，甚至在某些時刻逼近自己理想中的自我。當你每天努力彌補自己的道德缺陷、盡力為身邊他人帶來更多的安康（或至少不要帶來不必要的苦難），你就不可能認為人類是這個星球上的寄生蟲、將社會問題一股腦地歸咎於權力結構、認為唯有政府有所作為才能讓事情變得更好。\n\n相反地，你會發現只要秉持品格，即便過著極其平凡的生活也能深具意義。你更將相信人類確實有潛力成為真正善良、同理、勇敢、有智慧的物種。你會承擔起讓世界變得更好的責任，並透過為你周遭的人們成為最好的自己，來盡自己的一份力。\n\n**一個人對自己生命的道德意義及責任的態度，將根本性地決定他對全人類的態度。**","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC%E9%9A%8E%E7%B4%9A":{"title":"","content":"tags:

(Value Hierarchy)」——在每一個當下，判斷哪些事物優先於其他。\n\n\n如果將時間軸拉遠，人類作為一種「目的性的存在」更是不證自明：人會想要讓自己的價值被看見、會想要相信自己是被需要的、會想要知道自己活著的意義為何。也因此，當一個人遭逢意外（比方說感情破裂、工作失利、肢體損傷等），導致長期信奉的信念受到質疑、或生存目的遭到剝奪時，他自然會出現「認同危機 (Identity Crisis)」——這等同是告訴他「你這些年來『瞄準』的目標是錯的／已不復存在」。現在我們知道，你我生命中幾乎每分每秒都瞄準著什麼、都朝著某個方向前進，所以喪失「方向」的傷害絕對非同小可、更不是朋友在旁邊安慰「你不要這樣想就好了」可以輕易解決的。\n\n從實務的角度看，一個人的價值階級是否明確、是否清楚不同事物在他心目中的輕重緩急，也會直接影響他對生活的規劃、他投注時間的活動、他重視的人際關係。又或許我們該反過來看：你我在生活中的每一刻，其實都用行動體現著自己心中的價值階級，而那未必會跟我們自以為相信、掛在嘴上講給別人聽的價值如出一徹。因此要判斷一個人真正相信、真正放在優先順位的事情，最好的方式是觀察他的行動而非說詞；我們也該反求諸己，從自身的行動去檢視自己究竟是言行一致、抑或時常在自欺欺人。\n\n人類作為「目的性的存在」，我們不可能假裝所有事情都不重要、抑或都一樣重要，我們永遠都必須區分哪些事物比其他事物更重要，否則就會在利益衝突時落入進退兩難的處境。與動物不同的是，決定一件事情重要與否的，並非單單只是我們的生物本能，更是我們如何區分眼前一切事物的優先次序，而這個建立在「價值」之上的優先次序，就是個紮紮實實的道德問題。\n\n換句話說，一個人選擇參與這個世界的方式——就算他不相信道德、不認為生命有意義——在最根本的定義上就是個道德命題。無論你選擇怎麼活，那都是個道德性的價值選擇。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%81%A5%E5%85%A8%E8%B2%A8%E5%B9%A3%E8%83%BD%E6%BA%90%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E9%A6%AC%E5%85%8B%E6%80%9D":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Economics]]\n\n---\n貨幣是能源被人類開發後作為儲存的媒介。\n貨幣應是有限的，相應於地球上有限的能源。\n貨幣總數的限制致使，唯一能提升人們購買力的方式，即是創新。\n\n但在擁有健全貨幣的社會裡，創新的動機為何？\n資本主義自由市場中，唯有能替人們帶來比單純囤積貨幣更高報酬的創新，才可能使人願意投資。無謂的創業點子，和亂槍打鳥的投資將不復存在；為成長和消費而出現的產品及服務將不再有意義——同金本位時代。\n\n因貨幣與有限能源相應，獲取利潤的方式，唯有提供人們想要的產品和服務、或發明更有效率獲取能源的方式，即科技的創新。\n參考中世紀梅地奇家族之銀行業興旺，或可證明銀行未必需要創造更多貨幣以進行投資、刺激創新；\n相反地，資本社會中的創業家或許根本不需要、也不應該太多，而僅有部份才能出眾者應創業。大眾或可能樂見遍地開花的創業家，但那或許更多是貨幣量增加（以追求經濟成長）的副作用。\n因此，貨幣是人類對能源的開價，而並非總是銀行與民眾的承諾維繫。\n\n馬克思認為：資本主義的利潤，來自勞工（但其實也是用機器）的生產價值和生產成本間的差距所產生。他推論資本主義社會必將面臨邊際利潤的降低，導致資本家勢必得壓榨勞工以獲取利潤，因此資本主義社會必將走向社會主義。\n馬克思最大的錯誤，在於低估了創新所帶來的價值，這也體現於後來奉行馬克思主義的國家為什麼都極為欠缺創新、創業、創意。馬克思形塑的理論，正如其實踐的案例，均不見創新在其中扮演的角色。\n是故，資本主義的單一產品/服務的邊際效益會降低，但只要人有自由，就會企圖解決問題、進行改良和創新（無論是產品、服務、或提取能源的方式），進而再一次提高效益，或該說，是提高貨幣的購買力。\n就目前而言，若假想這樣的經濟模式在人類殖民的火星上運作，似乎仍是合理而可行的。\n\n---\n# Price of Energy\n- We never pay the price for energy, since our adoption of the classical/neo-classical economy theory (in which we price everything somewhere between its use value and manufacturing value).\n- In our current capitalist economic system, we are taxed according to our income, which has to do with our labor and skill. That, in turn, puts the emphasis on each person's ability, skill, and 'marketable' traits.\n- A better system that encourage and make easy people's virtue, which by definition will need to lower people's time preference, will be taxing people not by their income, but their consumption. The consumption of the goods that take more energy to produce, will be taxed more heavily to reflect the diminishing natural resource. \n- By taxing according to energy consumption, essentially encourages lower energy consumption and more moderate way of living. Human desires will not be eliminated because we will always have desires, but people will be encouraged to put their emphasis on things that come free in life, such as family, friendship, love.\n- Combining this with the fixed-quantity sound money, we'll have a much smaller economy that does not enslave people for infinite consumption and economic growth, but one that is driven by human passion, virtue, and innovation.\n  Ref: [[PBD Podcast  EP 128  Patron Saint of Bitcoin Michael Saylor]]\n  \n- **However, I'll still have to ponder on whether this 'resource-constrained' economy (unlike the current 'demand-driven' model) will end up being just like the soviet union, where no actual innovation happens, or will it become a better world for people where we're no longer enslaved by the capitalist hamster wheel and instead focus on the real worth-while things in life and see innovations that actually make people's lives better (not just pure entertainment).**\n  \n\n# Fossil Fuel\n\n- **Fossil fuel is the ultimate 'free lunch'** human will likely ever get.\n  **Fossil fuel** is the most '**pro-human**' energy - it's cheap, reliable, and uniquely superior at raising billions of people out of poverty.\n- Environmental activists are essentially supporting the policy to save the future generation by leaving billions of people today suffer. Many are not even willing to pay the real price of their vision, but wants others to suffer or voluntarily self-sterile to sustain their own quality of live.\n  Ref: [[Alex Epstein - The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels]]\n  \n# Nuclear\n\n- **Nuclear power** has the most potential, and should be considered the '**fairest**' energy - its waste is the ONLY kind that's responsibly contained and internalized, instead of emitting into the environment as pollution and material waste. \n- However it's probably the most misunderstood and stigmatized energy. People exaggerate its danger, and refuse to see why 'responsibly containing the waste of our own electricity production' is a fair and proper act. Most people don't notice the contradiction as to why they don't ever need to bother with the waste of any other types of electricity production.\n  Ref: [[Michael Shellenberger - Why renewables can’t save the planet]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%84%92%E5%AE%B6%E6%80%9D%E6%83%B3%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E7%A5%9E%E8%81%96%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[道德]]、[[儒家]]、[[意義]]、[[理想]]、[[潛能]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref:\n[[神聖個人概論]]\n\n---\n所以儒家是如何談論個人的神聖性？最顯著的例子是論語，衛靈公篇第十五・29：\n\n子曰：「人能弘道，非道弘人。」\n\n意思說，人生的正途與理想，必得仰賴個人的主動意志去弘揚，導正世道的責任因此落在每一個人的肩上。若無身體力行的投入，「道」即使再偉大也無法提升任何人。所以錢穆在《論語新解》中對這段註解說：「道由人興，亦由人行」、「若道能弘人，則人人盡成君子，世世盡是治平，學不必講，德不必修，坐待道弘矣」。\n\n顏淵篇第十二・1亦寫道：\n\n顏淵問仁。子曰：「克己復禮為仁。一日克己復禮，天下歸仁焉。為仁由己，而由人乎哉？」\n\n乍看之下，孔子說「仁」就是克制自己、以禮事人，但這個說法預設了人的本性是惡的、需要被抑制的，這跟下一句的「為仁由己」所展現的主動意義完全矛盾。傅佩榮針對這段的翻譯有不同理解，他引述《大學》中「克明俊德」，認為應將「克」字理解為「能夠」而非「克制」，於是「克己復禮」其實是說「人應該自覺而自願、自主而自動地實踐禮的要求」，這也才跟「為仁由己」有意義上的連貫。\n\n再一次，孔子指出仁的關鍵正是人的主動性及責任感，而非受到外在壓力的迫使。唯有真誠自願的行仁，才能彰顯一個人對自我的期許、對良善道德的信念，形成自我肯定的正向循環。主動去做正確的事，讓善行本身成為了目的、而非博取特定結果的手段，外在成果如何也就不會再令自己困擾。\n\n講到了仁，另一個值得提出的重點是，孔子在整部論語中幾乎不曾以仁德相許於人。在公冶長第五・19，他評論多位名人仕紳，均已「未知，焉得仁？」作結；在公冶長第五・8，他稱許數名弟子，但說「不知其仁也」；在述而第七・33，他談論自己時，則說「若聖與仁，則吾豈敢」。\n\n在孔子的哲學裡，直至一個人生命結束前都不可能斷定他是不是仁者，因為犯錯的人隨時可以改過自新、就地行善，有志之士也難免下一秒輕忽怠慢、便宜行事。更別說，如果閱人無數的孔子都不肯輕易地以仁德加冕他人，我們又有何資格用對別人的片面理解去做最終評判？\n\n由此可見，仁是一個人必須努力不懈、幾無可能達標的人格理想。它不是任何人可以真正佔有、從此高枕無憂的東西，而是個動態的、每分每秒都緊繫一個人的言行舉止的動名詞；仁不僅是行善，更是明白為什麼要行善，亦即知曉自己的天命。「止於至善」是通往人生正途的共同方向，但每個人出發的起點皆不相同，所以孔子在仁的題目上總是因材施教、針對不同學生的性格特質給出全然不同的建議。\n\n儒學雖討論政治、討論禮儀，但更多的焦點是放在個人的修為和責任，而不是後世所誤解的，將儒術視為君王控制人民、上級控制下屬、長輩控制晚輩的工具。修身齊家向來都是拿來要求自己的，不是拿來指點別人的。\n\n總結來說，儒家以「仁」作為人格理想，恰巧跟基督教的「罪」一正一反、卻是殊途同歸的觀點。它們清楚揭示了無論一個人要「成仁」或「贖罪」，都不該耽溺現狀、自以為功德圓滿、無條件接納自己，亦不該自怨自艾、貶抑個人價值、對自己背負的影響力和責任視而不見。人生在世，就要認清並傾力實踐自己「所能夠成為」的潛能，無論目標是達到至善或遠離罪惡。\n\n這份潛能，便是個人神聖性的基礎。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%84%92%E5%AE%B6%E6%80%9D%E6%83%B3%E4%B9%8B%E6%96%BC%E7%8F%BE%E4%BB%A3%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌿 \nlinks: [[儒家]]、[[社會]]、[[道德]]、[[政治]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nRef: \n[[數位民主與開放政府]]\n[[儒家思想中的神聖個人]]\nhttps://youtu.be/_b4qKv1Ctv8\n\n---\nThe crisis: Democracy rewards those who’re good at gaining power with power. Free market can slant toward rivalry thinking and push people into war. Once a country owns weapon, everyone will be forced to catch up. Once one person is cheating and exploiting the environment to get ahead, it’s no longer ethical to quit the game but to join it in order to maybe in a very scarce hope fix it. Limited resources still leads to zero sum game. One’s short-term benefit can be damaging to the collective’s long-term benefit. \n\nA new social and technological reinvention might be needed to get our hardware and software work together to achieve a more peaceful and thriving world.\n\nHardware: Ebay, Uber, Airbnb, Agoda...Encourage and reward the honesty, trust and good behaviors in people. It also make resources more sharable and not owned by any particular being. Digital technology also makes these things possible and greatly increase the capacity of every bit of resource. This leads to a more honest, trusting, abundant realm of reality that people can thrive in. This will eventually decentralize power from the governmener and force the governments to focus on providing basic services and protecting the country, instead of buying their way to power by waiving benefits at people.\n\nSoftware: A basic level of trust, earnestness, and empathy has to be instilled in the individuals in order for the system to work. Buddhism and some similar social technologies (Confucionism) succeed in augmenting people’s sence of empathy and allow them to expand their circle of good will over the 150 people tribe. This could be a very important basis for us to implement the necessary digitalized, sharing economy, none-zero-sum-game system for us to further maximize human wellbeing while minimizing the rivalry

Notes:\n\n儒家的個人神聖性：「人能弘道，非道弘人」、「人性向善」。政治上對個人道德的著重，一切使於個人道德的提升。盡善己身，以善天下；個人道德是政治參與的起點。\n\nWhere it goes wrong:\n\n遭誤解為權威政治的工具，「父母官思想」實與公民政治互斥。菁英政治不應為目的，亦不應視百姓為無自主、需被照顧及教育的孩童。\n菁英政治只可能是個人智識與德性提升者從政後的自然結果。\n對個人德性與主動性的強調，應推論出更去中心化的公民參與，而非更中心化的父母官集權政治。\n\nSummary:\n個人德性與主動性為文明之基石。對個人之重視應致使更去中心化的民主形式，儒家的道德訴求與禮教提供了法治社會一個能容許模糊地帶的公義(Justice)系統（e.g. 墮胎問題在臺灣與美國的對比）。法律無須作為人的行為底線，因情感、公理更先於法。\n\n援引道家：\n道家可謂最早的自由意志主義者，主張小政府、無為而治、降低干預，使自然、社會、人民、市場，接能自主調節、平衡、由下而上地產生秩序。\n\n---\n\n儒家之最高為政境界為「無為而治」，而非全面干預（中國共產黨式的父母官思維，或兩蔣時代的遺風）。\n\n\t（《論語衛靈公》，無為而治，其舜也與。\n\t\n\t道、無、有。無，又名始；母，又名母。據此，“無”字就被賦予雙重意義，一是帶有根本性即尊循發展機制、法則和規律的意義，二是不干涉人民的自由，讓其充分發揮所能作用的意義。\n\t\n\t在老子這裡，無為之意是具有兩重意思的。老子勸說在上層的治人治事者要無為，就是說只做根本性和基礎性的工作，讓人民擁有充分發揮其有為作用的條件和空間。生態世界是發展和治理最成功的典範，在上層的治人治事者若想取得成功，應道法自然顯而易見，無為而治需要治者無我，利他，“上善若水，水善利萬物而不爭，處眾人之所惡。）\n\n君主制之所以可能比代議民主更為可行，原因有二：時間偏好，及動機問題。\n四年一次的選舉，致使現代民主僅著眼當前、四年內之成績，而未能為更長遠未來規劃。\n相對地，運行穩定的君主制，應以德性及小政府為核心運作，並因為君主世襲，其時間偏好能與人民一致，做更長遠考量。\n儒者之政治的最高境界為「無為而治」之所以能「為無為」，正如孫子兵法所述，是因其透過「德政」建立「勢」。以仁德治國，可謂一種低時間偏好的政治形式，亦與世襲的君主制相呼應。\n*儒家以德治國＞天下歸順=低時間偏好的迂迴投資／勢之建立＞能為未來世代思慮之君主制＞以德性為核心的小政府「無為而治」*\n\n\n德性＝為當下＆跨期之個人＆群體考慮，盡力創造安康\n德政＝為人民建立更易於培養德性之條件／環境＝激發人性向善之趨力（不是強迫眾人為善）＝非以力服人\u0026追求短期成效的政治＝君主不藉「力」，而藉低時間偏好的仁政，以建立「勢」\n＝如戰國時代所示，德政乃是政治中的「迂迴投資」＝德政所產生的「勢」，能使天下歸順，君主方能倚賴民意得以傳位，而非以「力」保住權勢\n＝此「勢」得使仁君「無為而治」、達到儒家參政至最高點＆道家精神之核心\n因此在現代社會中：德性＝迂迴＝勢／道＝為無為（亦可解釋為善惡因果之運作）\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%84%92%E5%AE%B6%E8%AB%96%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E9%81%93%E5%BE%B7%E6%BD%9B%E8%83%BD":{"title":"","content":"tags:

今人乍見孺子將入於井，皆有怵惕惻隱之心。非所以內交於孺子之父母也，非所以要譽於鄉黨朋友也，非惡其聲而然也。由是觀之，無惻隱之心，非人也；無羞惡之心，非人也；無辭讓之心，非人也；無是非之心，非人也。\n\n\u003e 惻隱之心，仁之端也；羞惡之心，義之端也；辭讓之心，禮之端也；是非之心，智之端也。人之有是四端也，猶其有四體也。有是四端而自謂不能者，自賊者也；謂其君不能者，賊其君者也。凡有四端於我者，知皆擴而充之矣，若火之始然，泉之始達。\n\n看見一個小孩要跌進井裡去，任何人都會有驚駭同情的心情，孟子稱之為「惻隱之心」。此心震動，並非基於任何利益考慮（例如希望攀結那小孩的父母、博取鄉里朋友的讚譽，或因為討厭那小孩的哭聲），而是真心不忍他人無故受苦。孟子於是舉出「惻隱之心」等四端，說明人性之中本來就具備無條件關懷他人的道德潛能及傾向，也是其「性善論」的基礎。\n\n---\n或許有人會說，即使人有道德的潛能，也不意味我們就有責任要發揮它，何況人格的理想是幾乎不可能被達成的。雖然我認為這只是個悖於常理的詭辯，但讓我們從正反兩面討論人在道德實踐上的這份責任。\n\n從反面切入，我們可以參考孟子的說法：「人之所以異於禽獸者，幾希，庶民去之，君子存之。」這是說人與禽獸之間的差異就這麼一點點——這一點點正是我們具備的道德之心。若我們背離了道德追求、放棄了道德潛能的實踐，我們就稱不上是人，而與禽獸無異了。對儒家而言，堅守這條人類自我形象的底線，是不證自明的公理。\n\n從正面思考，我會重申這點：在我們企望著意義的生命中，不容忽視的是你我所秉持的理想、以及我們為達至理想所採取的行動。講白話點，如果你心中沒有一個值得前進的理想——理想的自我、或者身處在理想的人生風景中的自己（亦即另一種形式的理想自我）——並且為之付出像樣的努力，那麼要看見自己活著的意義，肯定會是個難題。\n\n正因為你我生來都帶著這份道德潛能、而德性作為理想卻是幾乎不可能被迄及的，這個在「潛能」與「理想」間的遙遠距離，反而更凸顯了追求德性的崇高與深刻，以及人類在這條漫長路途上的無限可能。就跟長跑——[這個專屬人類的運動方式](https://www.natgeomedia.com/environment/article/content-1823.html)——一樣，人類從沒有達到一個特定里程而從此開心佇足不再前進，反倒鍥而不捨地探索更遠的距離、更艱困的路途、更看似不可能的目標，而長跑的意義也正是由此彰顯。同樣地，既然人人皆有道德的潛能與傾向，那麼在道德上的追求和實踐就必定是為你我生命帶來豐富意義的重要旅程，無論我們此生能否看見終點。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%85%88%E6%B1%82%E5%AE%88%E6%88%90%E5%86%8D%E6%B1%82%E6%94%B9%E9%80%B2":{"title":"","content":"tags:

檢討秩序的起點\n\n**價值階級，就是辨認某些事物比其他事物更重要。一個社會要能建立秩序，需要大部分的成員都同意一套共同的價值階級，讓人們能夠為他們同樣重視的東西共同努力、避開不夠重要的活動、甚至懲罰那些有違公同價值的行為。**\n\n然而歷史告訴我們，社會的尺規並非總是理想美好的東西，許多時候它更是個不得不將人類靈魂削足適履的生硬規範。我們都知道秩序有可能替暴君背書、長久傳承的價值也可能迫害個人。\n\n因此，當我們相信當前的社會隱含某種系統性的問題，應該考慮以下幾種情形：\n\n第一，這個價值階級裡視為優先的東西有部分是錯的、或不合時宜的，需要汰換成新的、更符合當代生活與群體共識的項目。\n\n第二，這個價值階級有可能流於理想、缺乏現實條件支持，所以無法在當前社會的現實條件下有效運作、或即使運作了也無法帶來它宣稱的成果，僅能讓人們過著差強人意的生活。\n\n第三，這個價值階級的宣稱不乏實用性和實際成果，但因為時代演進，人們未能看清其價值、持續遵循、樂於將當前穩定視為理所當然，所以在引領群體的效用上漸顯乏力，這是價值階級在運行上出現了瑕疵，但並不代表價值階級本身是錯的。\n\n當我們嘗試檢討社會的秩序時，應當留心自己真正的動機、辨明自己的主張是哪一種，而不該囫圇吞棗地認定社會的問題是上述三者加總、草率做出「當前的社會秩序有其危害、故值得摒棄」的結論，甚至沒能夠提出繼續引領群體的替代方案。\n\n許多前衛開放的理想份子經常犯下的錯，正是一股腦地反動、想要揚棄傳統與秩序，卻沒看到自己腳下踩著的正是文化長河走過千百年所積累出的深厚土壤；如果真的將社會共同遵循的價值與秩序拋出腦後，你我生活中的一切「已知」都勢必將墮入混沌。流於意識形態、缺乏真知灼見的革命，更多只有啟動混亂的效用，而無法為社會注入新的、更有效引領群體前進的秩序。\n\n任何形式的革命都不是廉價的、讓大家喊起來自我感覺良好的東西，它背負著某種對現況的深度檢討與沉痛省思、最終仍不得不為的領悟，更得肩負著扛下一切後果的責任感。它不會、也不該只是某些人企圖卸除加諸在自己身上的制約或責任、所以提出要其他人有所改變的要求。\n\n一個人的道德實踐，不但是個人生命意義的來源，也是社會秩序的基石。在我們批判社會秩序如何壓迫個人、值得鄙棄之前，都該先問問自己是否行得正、坐得直，或者只是想透過批判「社會」這個看不見的敵人來博取免費的道德點數。\n\n在這個認知之上，我們便可以回過頭檢視社會秩序如何失調、對個人造成傷害。\n\n一間公司有可能在規模變大後出現腐敗的文化，人們開始玩政治、酬庸、搞小手段來晉升。在這種時候，有些人顯然不再秉持著跟公司本身相同的價值、秩序不再正確地運作、群體沒有以同一套價值階級去合作。微小的貪腐行徑若未被他人及時指出糾正，便會帶著公司一點一滴走向衰敗。全球500大企業名單大多無法在榜上連續待超過三十年、大部分成功的家族企業也很難生存超過三個世代，顯示了要維繫一個組織長期的有效合作、穩定運作是如此地艱難，更遑論要它與時俱進、進步創新。（更多精闢的分析在福山的《信任》多有著墨。）\n\n企業可能因文化腐敗而聘僱或晉升錯誤的人選、家庭可能因缺乏自省而以傳統價值去傷害個人自由、你我亦可能一時盲目而錯把另有所圖的人當成盟友，但這些都沒有消減秩序之於人類群體的重要性。相反地，這顯示了為什麼我們不僅必須充分認知到秩序的運作、時時審視著當下身處的組織是圍繞著什麼價值而生，更要慎重地面對關於人的各種決定、積極地捍衛價值的矗立、並適時做出調整與更正。所以我們在商管領域總能聽到關於企業文化的討論，也是為什麼當家裡長輩相繼過世時，我們能從後輩們接下來的互動中清楚觀察到家庭價值的彰顯或失落。\n\n---\n**唯有當我們釐清秩序、傳統、規範背後的原則，才能對之進行像樣的檢討。** 盲目服從規範與教條無益個人智識的提升，當然也就不可能促進文明的進步。我們既不應該因為先輩已經替我們建立了成規和傳統就矇上眼照著幹、不花任何力氣去理解規範和傳統背後的原則，也不應該因為任何成規和傳統是先輩留下來的「過時產物」，就在還沒有看清它們的原則及意義、甚至也給不出一個像樣的替代方案時，就將它們恣意鄙棄。\n\n針對價值、原則、意義的討論是艱深困難的，但也往往是最重要的。**無論我們承襲或變革，都有責任去領會既有秩序背後的深意。先求守成，再求改進。**","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%88%87%E5%AF%A6%E5%9C%B0%E8%AA%8D%E8%AD%98%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%9A%84%E7%88%B6%E6%AF%8D":{"title":"","content":"tags:

思想前衛的改革者興高采烈地走到它面前，說：「我看不出這柵欄有什麽用，我們把它拆了吧！」。對此，更聰明的改革者理當回答：「如果你看不到它的用處，我絕不會讓你拆除它。退到一旁好好想想，然後當你回來告訴我你確實搞清楚它的用途時，我才可能會允許你銷毀它。」\n\n切斯特頓的圍欄是個很有用的忠告：**在做出重大的公共決策前，我們應該理解當前決策背後的理由。** 僅僅因為我們搞清楚某個措施的一項功能，並不意味著我們已經搞清楚它的所有功能。\n\n柵欄不會從地底長出來，也不會是人們吃飽撐著跑去蓋的；它必定是有人基於特定原因建造的，就算是不合邏輯或無關緊要的原因，也仍然是原因。企圖移除柵欄的改革者，便有責任搞清楚建造這些柵欄的原因是什麽，否則任何自以為是的唐突改變都有可能讓事情變得更糟。\n\n許多現代人好於質疑任何形式的既有秩序、嚷著社會是個大牢籠、抗議長輩的要求和信念都只是家父長制的迂腐陋習；他們草率地推翻那些過去運作良好的事物，只為了支持新的、但沒有證據顯示能長久矗立的措施。這種批評更多是想替自己貼上知識份子標籤的表面功夫、誤把犬儒主義當成了事物的合理解釋。然而如果他們全面性地思考打破秩序後的社會應該如何運行，他們會發現自己並沒有像樣的替代品。\n\n更進一步來說，切斯特頓的柵欄告誡我們，當我們企圖干預他人建立起的系統或措施時，最好假設前人考慮了某些我們尚未了解的事情、或者有我們無法理解的經歷，所以我們不應躁進地尋求快速解法，因為這可能反讓情況變糟。\n\n切斯特頓的柵欄不是要勸退任何企圖改善現況的人，但它是一個重要的呼籲：在干預現狀前，先理解背後的思維。我們並不總是比那些在我們之前做出決定的人更清楚狀況；唯有深刻地同理前人的經歷及其面對的挑戰，我們才會更洞悉全局、看清當前措施的細微之處。除非我們知道為什麽有人做出這樣的決定，否則我們無法安全地改善它、或斷定他們做錯了。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%88%A5%E4%BD%8E%E4%BC%B0%E4%BD%A0%E4%BB%8A%E5%A4%A9%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%81%9A%E5%B0%8D%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n[[由自己組成的「跨期」社群]]\n[[關心「跨期」的道德實踐]]\n[[個人德性受脈絡所定]]\n\n---\n我們該思考「有意識地建立或參與能讓自身德性更可靠的情境」具體而言代表什麼。\n\n討論意志力的書籍經常建議我們要為自己打造一個容易養成良好習慣、能以最小阻力完成正確行動的環境：如果你想要瘦身，就把垃圾食物通通丟掉；如果你想戒掉手機成癮，就該買個Kitchen Safe當成你的「慾望控制箱」；如果你想要一大早就出門運動，或許可以考慮直接穿著運動套裝上床睡覺……諸如此類。\n\n這個道理在人生更深廣的各個面向也同樣值得信奉：你之所以該規律運動、健康生活，是為了讓你有更充沛的活力和意志去照顧你的家人，當他們越虛弱的時候你就越得強壯起來；你之所以從一開始就該跟那個有意與你調情的同事保持距離，是為了避免一步步踏入有一天你將難以抗拒偷情的險境；你之所以應該儘早養成儲蓄習慣、學習投資，是因為當你在財富上擁有越多主動權，你才會有餘裕去選擇你想讓家人過的生活，也才有能力去回應周遭他人的需求或致意。\n\n所以下一步，是羅列出所有我們能採取的有價值行動。當我們重新檢視生活中的每一個環節、將一切都盡可能化約到最小的單位，我們幾乎總是可以找到自己還能做得更好的地方，為生活中仍一片混亂的部分重建條理，將事物導向更美麗、更實用、或更有意義的方向。\n\n你可以嘗試用電腦文件或紙筆將這些想法寫下，包含在各種情境下你的行事原則和應做的事，那或許是七點半早起運動、這個月的飲食開始避開碳水化合物、每天至少跟另一半講一句表達感激的話、不再當工作上的濫好人並開始練習拒絕、甚至只是把你的書桌整理乾淨。\n\n在這個過程中，我們勢必得誠實、甚至謙卑地面對眼前的世界、他人、以及自己。我們眼前總是散落著凌亂的待解問題、被我們踢進沙發底下假裝不存在的潛在危機、或者因為我們自恃過高而不屑一顧的必要行動——或許你真的該每天空出十分鐘跟另一半好好談心、或花點時間整理好你的書桌，而非繼續自滿於自己目標的宏大、沒時間低下頭做這種「沒效益」的事情。\n\n從最微小的事物著手，第一是這使得行動和改變毫不費力、不用要求強大意志或寬裕時間才能做到，降低了行動的門檻；第二是這也讓我們沒有更多藉口延遲推託。我們眼前幾乎總有我們可以立即採取、將事物導往更好方向的作為，但我們往往太習慣為自己解套、總能想到為什麼「現在不方便」，即便內心深知自己早該有所作為。\n\n突如其來的巨大意外往往是來自微小傷害的積累：長年不改的菸癮，導致了突然的肺癌診斷；每天下班後對伴侶的不聞不問，導致了某一天發現原來對方早已出軌多年；有錢就花的消費習慣，導致了家人突然重病時的經濟困境。當你在個人生活或人際關係中一再地漠視那些積累已久的微小惡習或問題，它們有一天就會變成你無法掌控的巨獸，屆時，你也早已不再信任自己有能力戰勝它們。\n\n在光譜的另一端道理亦然：足球巨星的一夕爆紅源自十年來每天默默地苦練；YouTuber的成功源自一個接著一個不斷地產出高品質影音；警衛翻身百萬富翁，源自上班存錢、投資績優股並耐心等待數十年[4]。每一天，你也只需要比昨天的自己進步一點點——1%也好、0.1%也好——只要你每天都把一件事情做好，幾年下來的指數成長就會讓你成為完全不一樣的人，做得到別人完全無法想像的事。唯一的缺點是你不會有東西可以跟別人炫耀。\n\n很顯然，我們往往沒有體認到「今天如何生活」是件多麼重要且神聖的事情，經常是因為我們不夠看重自己[真正的價值](https://vocus.cc/@Emperors_Wolf/6136497efd897800019b4ac7)，不但低估了自己今天選擇怠惰苟且的後果，也低估了自己今天選擇積極勤奮的價值。\n\n每一天，我們都可以選擇至少做好一件微小的事情：你可以早起為伴侶準備早餐、可以在進公司的路上露出更多笑容、可以在會議上更勇敢地表達自己的見解、可以多跟某個你看不順眼的那個同事寒暄兩句、可以少抽一根菸、可以花一個小時把你的臥室整理好、可以用多一點時間聆聽伴侶描述他的一天、可以打一通電話回去慰問父母、可以抽出半個小時看那本你說要看完的書、可以在洗澡前做十個伏地挺身、可以在睡前多留一點時間來照顧自己的心靈。\n\n你會發現，在每一天的日常生活裡，你能做對的事情其實有太多太多，而今天的你只需要挑一件做到就夠了，你更可能發現，你根本有能力做到不止一件。當你今天為了自己或你愛的人完成一件你相信是正確的事，你會踏實感覺到你比昨天的自己又成長了一點點、萌生了多一分對自己的尊敬，這也是你努力使未來的自己更加可靠的重要一小步。\n\n每一個人每一天醒來都可以選擇要為這世界帶來更多的安康、抑或更多不必要的苦難，因此，我們沒有理由放任自我成為對自己、對他人來說都更不可靠、不值得信任、甚至帶來更多麻煩的人——有意識地建立或參與能讓自身德性更可靠的情境，實是個你我都背負的道德責任。\n\n一個人用來壯大自身的努力，應該朝著讓自己更具行善為仁的能力為目標，才可能在倉促人生中捉住那稍縱即逝的存在意義。而這些正確行為的積累，無論是否可能替我們免除生命中的苦難，它本身就是為將來的種種困境做好準備的唯一方式。\n\n當然，這並不是說我們永遠不能鬆掉發條、享受此刻。人生是一連串賽局的集合，有時候我們需要抓緊良機、乘勝追擊，有時候我們必須斷尾求生、留得青山，有時候我們該允許自己享受當下美好、勿留遺憾。然而我很確定的是，將你今天可以做對的事情做對、讓自己比昨天還要更好一點點，絕對比繼續漫無目的地虛擲光陰、放任每一個小問題擱置待解要好得太多。\n\n紀律是風險和混沌的唯一解藥。伴隨著這份紀律，帶來的是使你更能享受、珍惜生命的踏實感和自由，或至少，它將在生命的風暴中給你更堅強的庇護。這麼做，對你、對你所愛的人、對你身處的社群無一不是好的。\n\n別低估你今天可以做對的事。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%88%A5%E6%8A%8A%E6%B2%92%E6%9C%89%E5%B0%8D%E6%96%B9%E4%B9%9F%E6%B4%BB%E5%BE%97%E4%B8%8B%E5%8E%BB%E7%95%B6%E6%88%90%E7%B6%93%E7%87%9F%E6%84%9F%E6%83%85%E7%9A%84%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC":{"title":"","content":"tags:

，情感或習俗 。在這個意義上，理性化是現代社會形成的中心環節，特別在西方世界，以資本主義市場為基礎，官僚主義和國家管理的理性化狀態; 只是現代科學和現代技術的擴展。哲學家哈貝馬斯批評純粹的工具理性主義。「科學主義」也可以用來形容科學思維將自身提升到意識形態的過程。對於理論家，如鮑曼來說猶太人大屠殺 ，作為現代性表現的理性化可能是與令人遺憾的猶太大屠殺密切相關。——詳見[理性化](\u003chttps://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%90%86%E6%80%A7%E5%8C%96_(%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%9A%E5%AD%A6)\u003e)\n\n哲學的中心化與去中心化，是一個在文明層次的拉扯，在個人層次就如Fromm所述的、顯現於個人對自由的追求和逃避，或者說是個人對於混沌和秩序的偏好及調節。宗教或科學都並非一定是屬於混沌或秩序的類別，端看個人如何秉持這些信念；一個宗教對某人是秩序、對另一人可能是混沌，而科學亦然。\n\n哲學的中心化與去中心化，也可以在道德絕對和道德相對主義間的張力看見。道德絕對主義較容易與宗教掛勾，道德相對主義則經常被熱衷科學的份子所秉持。然而秉持「科學主義」的「理性化」現代人，有可能為標榜自己對多元自由的支持而秉持相對主義論點，但在個人生活中卻失去了中心化的哲學和道德權威，或索性將科學或存在主義視為內在權威。\n\n這個現象足顯個人生命中，某種哲學或道德上的內在權威實屬必要的，正如我們的生命需要一定程度的秩序來引領自身前進，所有價值的相對主義化、去中心化只會帶來疑惑、困頓、及失落。事實上，多數人都不是真正的虛無主義和道德相對主義者，我們幾乎總是帶著近似彼此的道德直覺在社會中生活，或許這正符合柏拉圖的觀點。\n\n\u003e知識是與生俱來的，因此學習只是將原本埋藏在靈魂深層的理想發掘出來，這種發掘的過程也經常是由哲學家所引導。柏拉圖相信每個靈魂在出生時都帶有「至善的形式」以及對所有事物的完美知識，因此當他們學習時只是將這些知識「回想起來」。\n\n中心化與去中心化的哲學、倫理、經濟、科技等面向，都深深影響我們每個人的生活，而我們終究得辨明的並不是何者才是正確，而是如何達到天平兩端的平衡。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%9F%BA%E7%9D%A3%E5%AE%97%E6%95%99%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E7%A5%9E%E8%81%96%E5%80%8B%E4%BA%BA":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n[[神聖個人概論]]\n[[罪論]]\n[[📝/基督教的核心]]\n\n---\n西方文明的起點是希伯來文明與希臘文明，即所謂的「兩希文明」。\n\n希伯來文明的中心耶路撒冷，彰顯了猶太基督教的宗教啟示：一個全善的神創造了一個有秩序的宇宙，並要求人類依祂頒佈的律法去建立道德完善的社會、方能活出幸福的人生。希臘文明的中心雅典，則代表著希臘哲學的重要價值：理性與邏輯，並由家喻戶曉的柏拉圖、亞里斯多德等聖哲所體現。\n\n西方社會強烈的個體主義——我會說它是廣義的「神聖個人」觀念——在兩希文化中更被基督宗教所凸顯，其最明確的根源之一，是聖經、創世記1章27節：\n\n上帝就照著自己的形像造人，乃是照著祂的形像造男造女。\n\n這段話開門見山地闡明了人與神的關係、以及人類在宇宙中獨一無二的重要地位。在信上帝的社會裡，就因如此、亦僅需如此，每一個人的生命就有了其不可剝奪的神聖價值、有了其不證自明的存在目的。它說明了每一個人都是盛裝神性的容器、擁有實踐德行與榮耀上帝的潛能，所以背負著使世界變得更好的道德義務。近代習以為常的「天賦人權」觀念可說就是起源自此。\n\n另一個基督宗教最根本性的觀點是「罪」。\n\n\n對聖經故事稍有聽聞的人應該都知道「原罪」的來源：亞當和夏娃背叛天主、偷嘗禁果，所以被逐出伊甸園、失去與天主共融的幸福，人類從此背負了必死的命運、原罪則一代接一代遺傳後世。\n\n這就如罪是從一人入了世界，死又是從罪來的；於是死就臨到眾人，因為眾人都犯了罪。——《羅馬書》第5章第12節\n\n正因為人一出生就背負了原罪，因此縱然每個人都具備不可剝奪的價值，仍得付出相當的努力才能獲得上帝赦免，比方說信神、贖罪、勤勉工作、做上帝所喜悅的事、過上帝所悅納的生活等等（至於其中的細節，那就是不同教派間意見分歧的部分了）。\n\n上帝創造了宇宙及其律法，人的犯罪便是行了任何違反上帝標準的言行思想。在希伯來語裡，罪的原意是「偏離目標」（Missing the mark），這個解讀很值得再三咀嚼，它說明了要避免「罪」，你必得有個「我應該如何為人」的目標，並專心一志地朝之前進，而不是輕易滿足於現狀或放過自己，否則任何行差踏錯都可能是犯罪。\n\n綜合以上，基督宗教為我們點明了「神聖個人」的深刻詮釋：每個人都具有神聖不可剝奪的價值，但一個人的價值並不存在於「他所是」的狀態、而是由「他所能夠成為」的人所彰顯。若套入基督教的語彙，那就是你不該安心接納自己作為原罪遺傳者的現狀，而是要努力過著親近上帝的生活、活出足以榮耀上帝的潛能。\n\n雖然近代西方世界逐漸疏離了自己文化底層的基督教根基，反以啟蒙主義的純粹理性來包裝這份對個人神聖性的重視，但難以爭辯的是，基督宗教的洞見仍是使西方個體主義兩千年來生長茁壯的土壤。這或許是現已高度資本化、世俗化的西方社會需要反思的文明課題。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%9F%BA%E7%9D%A3%E6%95%99%E7%9A%84%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83":{"title":"","content":"tags:

讓基督教與眾不同的，是這個非常奇異的宣稱：**神成為了我們的一份子、成為了一個「被造物」，但祂既沒有喪失作為上帝的身份、也沒有掩蓋被造物的完整性。**\n  \n  正如〈出埃及記〉中、摩西遭遇的「焚而不燬的荊棘」：\n  \n  \u003e 耶和華的使者在荊棘的火焰中向他顯現。摩西觀看，看哪，荊棘在火中焚燒，卻沒有燒燬。摩西說：「我要轉過去看這大異象，這荊棘為何沒有燒燬呢？」\n  \n  在這裡，神就是「燃燒」的動作本身，但特別的是，神的「燃燒」雖然散發著溫熱和火光，卻不燒燬任一枝葉——這說明了神的作動原則：祂越是接近我，就使我越發有光彩，卻絲毫不會減損我的存在。\n  \n  將這個概念提升到極致，即是我們所謂的「道成肉身」：**上帝之子作為受造物來到世上，以其極致的方式要使全人類變得美麗光彩**——此即基督教的支柱。\n  \n  隨之而來的，是對所有現實的救贖。所以不僅僅是人類的救贖，更是在成為受造物的過程中，上帝將整個世界神化了。所以希臘先哲說「**上帝成為人類，以使人類亦可能成為上帝**」——這對於基督教的核心觀點是個不錯的總結。\n  \n- 假如上帝變成人類，那就意味著人類存在一種根本上的尊嚴，且超越了任何人本主義者能用以證明人類尊嚴的任何宣稱。\n  \n  從這個角度看來，中古世紀的基督教可謂我們所能想像到的、最偉大的人本主義：上帝成為了我們的一員，以使我們神化。因此，我生命的目標不僅僅是成為一個好人、成功人士、或社會上有用的一員，我的生命目標是要投身於這份偉大的神性。\n\n[[耶穌作為理想人類的典範]]","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%A4%A7%E7%B0%A1%E5%8C%96%E8%83%BD%E6%BA%90%E8%B2%A8%E5%B9%A3%E4%BA%BA%E8%85%A6%E5%85%B1%E5%A1%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8D%B1%E6%A9%9F":{"title":"","content":"tags:

被奴役的能源\n\n人類歷史發展至今，第一個重要的文明轉捩點，是在約莫十萬年前、地球氣候變暖並穩定下來時，發生的第一次農業革命。當時，[轉向農耕和畜牧的人類部落，其生產力大大地超過了仍以狩獵採集為主的表親](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/was-agriculture-impossible-during-the-pleistocene-but-mandatory-during-the-holocene-a-climate-change-hypothesis/246B240BFFFBE904B1AC31296AD72949)。\n\n農耕帶來大量的生產力盈餘，[使早期人類向全球擴散](https://wwnorton.com/books/The-Social-Conquest-of-Earth/)，擴大了貿易範圍與科技發展。到了16世紀，[更複雜的社會組織和先進的航海技術](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Europe/The-emergence-of-modern-Europe-1500-1648)又開啟了人類歷史上另一個驚奇篇章。至此為止，[人類文明都是以生物能——人類和草食動物的肌肉——作為生產活動的動力來源](https://vaclavsmil.com/2021/03/05/grand-transitions-how-the-modern-world-was-made/)，增長幅度有所侷限。\n\n直到19世紀初，一切都改變了。\n\n人類發現如何提取及利用地殼表層下的化石能源——煤炭、石油、天然氣等——來驅動我們的生產活動。就地質學來說，人類無疑是發現了「**被封存在地底的太陽能**」。在新能源龐大的力量面前，人類和動物的勞動從此退居次位。這乃是史上頭一遭。\n\n結合了機器的力量，一加侖的汽油可以在幾分鐘內輸出與一個人勞動一整個月相同的工作量。雖然人類使用肌肉工作的能量效率和靈活度是非常優異的（可以想想，驅動一輛汽車的汽油有多少變成了廢熱散失），但在需要蠻力的任務上，再多的人類都無法完成化石能源的工作。\n\n工業化的故事，基本上就是以化石能源（加上機器）取代人類勞動力，創造更高的利潤、更高的工資、更便宜的產品。在過程中，我們的能源使用效率變得非常低，但經濟效益非常高。來到20世紀後半葉，當我們又成功將動力來源從煤炭升級為高品質的液態石油，人類經濟的平均增長率再次翻倍，現已是過去幾千年平均水平的30倍以上。\n\n在現今活著的79億人類中，排除兒童和退休人士，實際的人類勞動力是45至50億人。全世界每年使用354億桶石油，若把我們使用的所有煤炭和天然氣也換算進去，總數則是1000億桶石油。與全球人類的勞動力相比，由化石能源驅動的機器為我們增加了等同於5000億個工人的力量。\n\n化石能源的龐大力量， 使數十億人類得以出生，使數十億的人脫離貧窮，更創造了新的神話、制度、以及對未來的期待。無怪乎哲學家Buckminster Fuller將化石能源比喻作人類的「**能源奴隸**」。\n\n\n\n我們祖先的生活與地球的自然規律——太陽、雨水、土壤——緊密相連，但在近幾個世紀一飛衝天的經濟和科技趨勢中，人類與大自然的基本聯繫先是被忽視，然後被遺忘。 \n\n[現今經濟的主要驅動力](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067)大多是免費的。我們往往只需要支付它們的開採成本，卻不必擔心它們如何產生的、它們真正的價值為何、以及它們可能造成的污染。對我們的祖先來說，化石能源簡直就是從地底噴發出來的魔法。 \n\n然而，我們不但不知道要對這個一次性的天外橫財心存感恩，反而還捏造故事自欺，宣稱人類此刻擁有的財富和進步，皆是來自我們的聰明才智。 \n\n現代經濟理論認為，生產力（它是我們財富和物質進步的基礎）是勞動和資本的產物。在這個等式裡，能源只不過是**另一種投入**，其單位價格僅僅代表著**其對經濟產出的貢獻**。一桶石油代表了人類將近5年的勞動力，而我們只消支付其開採成本（目前在2022年約為50美元），卻不必考慮它被創造出來的數千萬年進程。\n\n我們對化石能源——這項人類經濟的主要投入——並沒有支付正確的價碼，現行的經濟學理論更是輕易忽略了這個事實。**我們已然對能源的真實價值和有限性徹底目盲。**\n\n\n---\n\n# 被篡偽的貨幣\n\n**從過去到未來，能量都扮演著生命的「貨幣」。**\n\n就這個理解，動植物就是能量的第一批投資者——獲取更多的「能量盈餘」，就能使動物在生存和[繁殖](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/152/%C2%A0)方面更具競爭優勢。換句話說，「能量盈餘」的作用正是物競天擇的核心驅動力，為大自然決定了什麼可能發生，什麼不可能[發生](https://www.jstor.org/stable/84174)。\n\n當然，人們很少用能量的角度去思考這些事。\n\n生活在化石能源為我們帶來的神奇魔法時代，幾百年來人類消耗這顆稱為「地球」的大電池的速度，是大自然日常光合作用的數百萬倍。化石能源為人類經濟可運用的剩餘[能源](\u003c[能源](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/188/)\u003e)帶來巨幅增加。\n\n但這個封存於地底的魔法可不是用之不竭的。\n\n高質量的礦石和能源礦藏已經是過去式了。現在雖仍存在著大量礦藏，但它們的質量較低、開採成本較高、對生態環境破壞性也較大。在自然界中，有無數例子表明了能源確實存在，但要提取它們的代價過於龐大，以致許多選項已不可能被考慮。**在我們的有生之年，人類社會將不得不把越來越多的能源盈餘轉用於獲取能源本身，留下更少我們負擔得起的能源來支持眼前的許多經濟活動。**\n\n就像獵豹付出同等的力氣去追逐一隻肥羚羊、一隻瘦羚羊或一隻兔子會得到完全不同的效益，我們在德克薩斯州的油井、在海底5英里處、或在阿爾伯塔省的沙漠裡榨取石油所得到的效益也大不相同。地球表面下確實存在數萬億桶石油——而且我們知道它們在哪裡——但要怎麼用經濟上（和生態上）有說服力的成本去取得它們，那完全就是另一個問題了。\n\n在這個前所未有的大量剩餘的時代，我們擅長將能源和原料組合成改善人類體驗的科技和發明。新科技可以讓我們更有效地使用資源，或者將自然的運行轉化成能源，但大多數科技都只是為人類創造了新的消費方式，並建立了未來對[能源](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00026/full)和[原料](https://read.realityblind.world/view/388478403/143/)的更高要求。即便像太陽能和風能的綠色能源，也往往只徒增了我們的總能源消耗量，更甚至沒有減少[全球的碳能源使用](https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-market-report-july-2021)。\n\n\n\n大多數人認為金錢是真正的財富。然而，我們花錢買到的一切，都需要能源來開採、創造、交付、運行、和維護。就這個角度來說，**金錢其實是人類對[能源和資源](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067#bib0680)的開價。**\n\n我們的經濟故事宣稱，有了更多的錢，我們就可以[創造更多的東西](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521914001070)。 但事實是**自然資本——特別是能源——才是我們貨幣體系的真正基礎。當我們創造更多的貨幣時，我們並沒有創造更多的能源，我們只是在加速能源的透支。**\n\n隨著石油產量的增長達到達到了[最高點](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/gdp-growth-rate)，人類經濟有史以來最高的持續增長率在50年前達到了頂點。但我們並沒有就此滿足，反而投機取巧來延長經濟成長。\n\n**債務，可謂現代經濟的神奇魔術——它讓我們花費來自未來的資源、維持高消費水準，並稱之為[經濟成長](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067#bib0680)**。 大量舉債的現象在過去50年間變得如此普遍，我們早已習慣了「今天享受、明天付帳」的生活模式。\n\n**先進國家現在正利用[債務](https://blogs.imf.org/2021/12/15/global-debt-reaches-a-record-226-trillion/)來提領我們本來沒有能力提領的資源，用以生產我們本來沒有能力消費的商品。這種策略肯定有個截止日——因為有一天，這些新產生的錢都必須被花在真正需要能源的實際事物上。**\n\n\n\n**現代文明已將人類的生命經驗徹底金融化**。我們不僅把人類生活的豐富層次化約為單一的貨幣標記，還貼上了錯誤的價格——所謂錯誤，是以長遠、超越人類自身範疇來說。\n\n貨幣的價格是錯誤的，因為我們可以恣意按按鈕來增加貨幣供應，預支我們根本還沒有提取的天然資源。\n\n能源的價格是錯誤的，因為我們將之視為理所當然、無窮無盡的地底魔法，忽略了它們在任何人類的時間尺度上都是不可再生的。\n\n而現在，人類這個擁有近80億成員的社會性動物正集體追逐著「利潤」；以國內生產毛額計價的「成長」，儼然成為了社會穩定的必需品。人類文明將各項決策和計畫外包給龐大複雜的金融系統，市場對「成長」的上癮卻已取代了任何可能蘊含智慧和自律的替代方案。\n\n這個系統不再受到任何人的控制。人類——就這個定義上——已經成為一個盲目、永不滿足、貪求能量的[超個體](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B6%85%E4%B8%AA%E4%BD%93)。\n\n\n---\n#

Hour的啤酒。[與其他動物不同的是，人類是個極為社會化的物種](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302252/)；我們會以家庭、小企業、公司、甚至民族和國家為單位進行協調，以最大化我們的虛擬盈餘——金錢——然後把它們花在真實的東西上。\n\n在生物學上，「最適攝食理論」告訴我們，在其他條件固定的情況下，動物如何最佳化他們的能量效益。就算我們能夠拋棄資本主義作為現代世界的組織模式，這種「以最少投入獲得最大收穫」的驅動力仍然會存在於我們的本能之中。\n\n這種本能也有其反效果——[我們對損失超級敏感](https://read.realityblind.world/view/975731937/82/)。你的投資從10000元漲至11000元時的愉快，無法補足它從11000元跌到10000元時的沮喪，畢竟在我們祖先的時代，今天運氣好得到了額外食物確實不錯，但運氣不好失去食物時就可能會要人命。\n\n**我們在經濟和生態上的真正挑戰，來自於人類仍以狩獵採集者的原始大腦，在充滿競爭性的消費成長文化裡生活。[人類天性的錯置，驅策我們打造出這個已經不再真正關心自身（人類）福祉的超個體。](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800919310067)**\n\n\n\n看看我們今天的生活方式，或許有人會聳聳肩說「人類就是這樣」——這是個誘人但廉價的觀點。現代社會，只是人類歷史長河裡成千上萬個繁榮文明的其中一個。[今天活著的人類並沒有「選擇」自身階級或文化的貪婪，相反地，我們大部分的人生選擇都受到自己出生的經濟體系所制約。](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/ultrasocial/FE883BB2158FE38C96DD8670E99CC730)\n\n說真的，人類並不是生來就有環境或能源問題，我們眼前的這些問題是不小心把地球上80億人的狩獵採集者大腦泡進消費成長文化這淌渾水的結果。這世界的現狀不是任何人的錯，但我們大多數人都是幫凶。瞭解到人類文明的「超個體」現實或許會令人非常沮喪，因為這顯示了沒有人可以真正做點什麼，但它不僅澄清了我們面對的現狀，也揭露了未來可能的道路。\n\n人類文明當前的高消費、貧富不均、科技迷戀、缺乏人際連結等現象，皆是地底能源魔法的直接產物。\n\n[雖然人類的大腦無法迅速改變，但在適當的條件下，行為和社會規範有可能閃電般地更迭](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1149491/)；我們在面對挑戰時具有難以置信的適應能力。\n\n我們可以安全地相信，人類近代的生活方式是種反常現象，只不過我們視之為理所當然，因為作為個體，這就是我們所認識的一切。\n\n邁向未來，一些適應了低能源使用的生活方式將重新連接我們的虛擬世界和物理世界，讓我們能重新建立對「是非真偽」的共同理解。立基於真實的人類需求（而非債務推動的消費主義和經濟成長），我們的生活將不必這麼全球化，但能享有更多的人際互動，以及與大自然的可貴連結。\n\n作為一個物種，這個貪婪短視的全球性超個體絕非我們的命運。人類之所以被帶到這個懸崖邊，是因為我們「所是」的本性；但這個時代真正的課題，將取決於我們——作為個人、也作為社會——「所能夠成為」的樣貌。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E6%89%BE%E5%88%B0%E7%A5%9E":{"title":"","content":"tags:

當我們說神是「『本質』與『存在』重疊」、是「『存有』的動作本身」，這些都是對神的正確描述，但它們究竟代表什麼呢？我們無從得知，因為我們日常的生命經驗中並沒有任何東西與之對應。我們經驗中的所有東西，都是奠基於某種「本質」之上的「存在」，但神不是這樣的東西，所以你才會遍尋不得。\n  \n- 作為神，就是作為「存有」本身。祂既不是這個也不是那個、既不在上也不在下、既不在這裡也不在那裡。神的中心位於所有地方、神的周遭不是任何一處——就像神秘主義者會說的。\n  \n  那現在我可以對神有個清晰明確的理解了嗎？依然沒有，而且正該如此。\n  \n- 神，以一種非競爭性的方式超越了整個俗世——這應是對神的基本理解。\n  \n- 因此，無神論者往往犯下的一個範疇錯誤，是以為我們所討論的上帝，是一個在你我生命故事中的角色。不，祂是這整個故事的作者，神秘地存在於故事的每一個角落，卻不是一個你可以在故事中找到的角色。\n  \n- 奧古斯丁（Augustine）說神是interior intimo meo et superior summo meo，意思是祂距離我、比我距離自己還更靠近，同時祂比我所能想像的任何東西都還要崇高。因為一旦我們能夠理解「神是純粹主動的『存有』」，那麼理所當然地，此時此刻，神正維繫著我們的存在。\n  \n  阿奎那說，神是以「本質、存在、力量」的形式，極其緊密地存在於萬物之中……但同時，祂又不在這房間裡。所以祂在哪呢？祂不在任何地方，祂是個「徹底他者（Totally Other）」。\n  \n

for a person is to interact with who you believe the person 'could be', not who the person 'is'\n\n\n\nFirstly, you never really get to know a person 100%, thus it's not okay to assume you know what 'reality' is. You don't fully know a person 100%, nor do you know the 'reality', so don't assume you've take it into account\n\nSecondly, the respect you pay a person is not based on who he/she is, but what you expect out of him/her. It's not to say you should based your interaction with people on who you expect them to be, even though it's quite often the case, be it negative or positive.\n\nA better way to put it is that, you don't interact with what the person is, but what the person could be. Even though it's gonna base on partially your expectation, but it can also be based on what the 'ideal self' that person can be.\n\nThink your interaction with a kid. Often times we don't necessarily interact with a kid in the way that we really see what he/she is, rather we interact with who we believe he/she can become. It's not possible to shy away from your own expectation of a kid, but at the same time, it's safe to assume that you know what's 'more than who he/she currently is', and so does everyone else around.\n\nWe interact with a kid in this way. We put a universal expectation and encouragement around the kid, so he/she continues to act 'more' and grow. We don't interfere with the interaction by seeing that he/she is not at a certain level that it's not enough for us to continue any communication.\n\nThis is quite precisely why teenagers often feel not respected by adults, because adults act in a way that tells them 'you're only what you are - a teenager' while they want to be viewed as 'more than who they currently are'. They know fully well that they're not yet adults, yet giving them such respect and the corresponding personal responsibility is one of the best way to cultivate their characters and forge them into real adults.\n\nWhen we see who a person 'really is', it's useful to ask yourself if you've lost 'faith' in this 'reality'. You need to understand that every 'better future' is emerged from a 'not-that-good-yet now', and every person's 'better/ideal self' is emerged from the person he/she is today. It's fairly easy to lose faith in humanity when you simply 'see reality as it is' yet don't fully understand that the current reality is precisely what gives birth to a better future. Same with any person, regardless whether you think so or not, because as stated, you don't fully know the person, nor his/her potential.\n\nDon't assume you know reality well enough that you can look down on it. Give each person - essentially a facet of the reality - his/her proper respect, by treating him/her as who they could be, not who they currently are.\n\nThe same goes with yourself. Instead of going with what others expect from you (which is very useful as well), you should also put the same self-respect and expectation-for-more onto yourself. Living up to others expectation is great, but living up to your own expectation for yourself and in turn alter what others expect from you, is often times more fulfilling. Don't assume you know yourself well enough to look down on your potential for good and greatness.\n\nWhen we pay such respect to all facets of reality that we encounter - including each others and ourselves - we're doing the very work to transform each present moment into a better future, by transforming each person into a better version of themselves, including us.\n\nRespect for the reality isn't mere optimism, it's really viewing each moment and each grain of current status as something so divine, that something better will manifest if you put in the work to transform it, or at least, in the process you'll transform yourself.

\n[[後現代的價值真空]]\n[[科技是形塑人類歷史的無形力量]]\n\n---\n所以我們會問：為什麼現代人揚棄傳統、抗拒責任、蔑視美德，卻沒有更快樂、反而有前所未有的大量心理問題？為什麼現代人不再信仰個人生命的神聖意義，反而樂於向外討伐應該負責和值得怪罪的對象？為什麼「覺醒」的年輕一代，對社會體制秉持批判態度、樂於打倒舊時代偶像，卻將改善個人生活的責任歸咎於政府或大公司身上，自己反而不想努力了？\n\n在高度全球化的二十一世紀，這其實更多是全球經濟、國際情勢、以及當代科技的緣故：現代經濟由債務驅動，透過前所未有的貨幣流通量，預支未來能源來支出當年度GDP；全球供應鏈使將七大洲的民生存亡繫成一線，新冠肺炎輕而易舉地癱瘓了多數人的生活；政治角力背後終究是為了便宜人力和能源所讓步的姑息主義；消費文化鼓勵我們用更多的錢、注意力、個人隱私去換多巴胺，養肥的是一堆超級了解我們的演算法、以及科技巨頭的資本。\n\n這個情景下，古典美德毫無用武之地、宗教傳統亦缺乏對現狀的解釋力，理所當然地，現代人便逐漸背離古典美德、放棄儲蓄、用享樂主義填補追不上通貨膨脹的無力感、甚至看透了生命意義的虛無。\n\n**當「個人」不再是任何人能有所作為的施力點，我們便難以相信自己在家庭裡有值得犧牲的使命、在經濟上的辛勤能有未來報償、在人生中的苦難能獲得意義與救贖。** 人們對於犧牲的信念遭到掏空、對社群的信任遭到侵蝕、個人的道德潛能遭到壓抑，而最終，**我們一個個都成了這個「超有機體」裡、被以生產力和消費力計價的行屍走肉。**\n\n犧牲的信念需要經驗的驗證、情境的允許、甚至信仰的跳躍，但在這個時刻，前兩者已站不住腳，後者也就無力說服多數人。\n\n在實務上，宗教信仰帶給人的一個優勢，是能夠較堅定地相信「彼岸救贖」的存在，進而支持、合理化此生的犧牲奉獻和道德作為。然而，講求事實理性、不再懷抱傳統道德和宗教信仰的現代人，已很難用「陰德」或「死後審判」的彼岸觀點來約束個人行為、提升品德。所以在尼采說「上帝已死」、杜思妥也夫斯基說「若無上帝，一切皆可為」的這個時代裡，我們才會遭遇如此深層的道德焦慮——一方面，我們很享受沒有老大哥監視、不用擔心死後彼岸的自由人生；另一方面，我們卻像浮萍般在紊亂難解的世界局勢裡無所依靠、向宇宙探問著生命的意義。\n\n一定程度上，這也解釋了為什麼現代人如此熱衷政治、社會正義、環保運動，幾乎到了宗教式的狂熱程度。Jonathan Haidt指出演化為人類配備了「超越小我、融入大我」的**宗教性趨力**，當現代人以為自己擺脫了迂腐迷信的束縛，實際上卻是幾乎任何東西都可以成為宗教的替代品、都可以充斥跟宗教同等的狂熱和偏執、也都可以成為討伐異己的「聖戰」之端。\n\n所以我們必須認清，**再多痛心疾首的道德呼籲都不會是解決這個世代難題的充分解答**，因為我們身處的全球化經濟系統，是個逼著所有人一起為不切實際的經濟目標奮鬥的雙輸賽局。基於更高的道德理想而先在這個遊戲中踩煞車的人，只是置自己的生死不顧、優先讓自己喪失競爭資格而已，卻改變不了其他為求生存的人埋著頭繼續遵從遊戲規則。\n\n我們確實需要人們重拾生而為人的高貴德性、昂首闊步地活出有意義的道德生活，但我們更需要一個嶄新的理解，幫助我們搞懂這個似乎不可能有效解決任何大規模重要問題的紛亂世界，進而**有意識地將人類的未來導向正確的方向，創造能使每個人更易於培養和體現德性的「可靠的」情境**——我相信，這是當代人類的緊要任務。\n\n**人類必須能夠有脈絡地、有共識地理解你我身處的世界，我們才可能重拾犧牲的信念、看見奮鬥和受苦的意義，並願意為了人類更美好的未來奉獻此生。** 從這裡，我們必須踏出個人道德生活的範圍，邁入科技、經濟、政治的領域，而那就是我們日後文章將企圖探索的。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E8%88%87%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C":{"title":"","content":"tags:

(think Wikipedia vs regular

(Kevin Kelly大概會這麼詮釋)——就是如此轉化人類的生活，一次又一次地將人類從勞力性工作、甚至技術性工作中解放。\n\n解放去哪裡呢？我認為科技正在引領我們走向將「人類本質（使人類與其他動物有所區隔的特質）」更「精粹化」的道路，包含了昇華人類的理性、道德、創造力等。這或許也呼應了哈拉瑞所說的，人類正走向「神化」。\n\n以我熟悉的數位音樂產業為例：數位音樂科技（便宜的錄音介面、現代電腦強大的運算能力、類比器材的大量數位化）為現代音樂人帶來的，是前所未有的極低門檻。已經有許多名聲顯赫的年輕製作人/音樂家透過自己的Macbook做出了一夕成名的當紅單曲；Dua Lipa的暢銷歌Don't Start Now裡被貝斯手們競相Cover的Bass Line甚至不是真的樂手錄的，而是MIDI加音源做出來的。\n\n既然現在要做出很棒的錄音幾乎不需要花大錢進錄音室、發布音樂也根本不需要有唱片公司看上你，那麼真正隔在音樂人和樂迷之間的，就只是一首夠好、夠打動人的歌。於是乎，三十年前一個城市裡寥寥無幾的錄音室裡的錄音師，他可以仗著你幾乎不可能找到第二個有能力按錄音鍵的人來幫你完成專輯，而對你頤指氣使大小聲，至於他有沒有拿出像樣的熱忱來服務你的藝術，你也沒有說嘴的份。但現在，如果你想要、而且你對自己有像樣的要求，那麼你可以不用忍受任何一個「老師級人物」對你的指指點點和難配合的態度；你有本事就可以自己來，或者找到名字後面不會被加上「老師」兩個字、但是對你的作品有一百分熱忱的音樂人來幫你一起完成。\n\n對於花了十萬個小時、甚至吃了許多苦才培養出一技之長的匠人們，確實，這看起來是一件令人跳腳的事情，但那些汽車組裝員何嘗不是如此？還有在那之前，那些因為汽車普及、不再有人騎馬而生計受影響的農家呢？人類工作因科技進步被剝奪，這當然不是件輕鬆愉悅的事情，然而我們很難不同意這終究是為人類整體帶來更多便利及安康的必要過程。\n\n我們就接著聊汽車及其相關產業的趨勢：傳統上，人們大多基於通勤的需要而買車，傳統油車有著眾多會耗損的部件需要保養維護。人們買車後除非營業需要，不然開車的時間幾乎不可能比熄火的時間多，亦即大部分的車在大部分時候都沒有在開。於是有了Uber或iRent這樣的服務出現，前者透過數位科技讓自用車可以加入營業車行列，後者透過數位科技讓營業車得以扮演短暫的自用車（即租賃），兩者都是善用共享資源的新興生意模式。\n\n值得關注的下一步，也就是Tesla現在帶頭在做的事情：電動化與自動駕駛。電動化是能源問題的關鍵、也大幅改善了傳統油車的折耗缺點，而自動駕駛，則是試圖將「人為錯誤」直接從個人運輸的這幅圖像中完全移除。今天，當AI已經有能力在超短時間內做出直逼工匠的繪畫，或許人們一直半信半疑的自動駕駛也確實如Elon Musk所承諾的，已經離我們的生活不遠了。而屆時，我們或許可以想像一種完全去中心化（與大眾運輸工具相對）的個人運輸工具，建立在數位科技、共享資源、和自動駕駛之上，那將使得「通勤」這件事情從此不再是人們需要擔心的事情，而將焦點放在你從A點到B點過程中的體驗、或者是你在過程中能創造的其他價值上。而屆時，玩車、養車、自己開車，想必會是一些人懷抱浪漫熱情的嗜好——就像有人會想去馬場騎馬一樣。\n\n在這個「精粹化」的過程中，我們都知道人類逐漸走向知識經濟的工作型態，而隨著AI、機器人、數位化的科技發展，可以預見的是人類的工作型態會越來越遠離任何形式的勞動與技術，而更聚焦於「人類靈魂」昇華之上——如果不介意我用這樣的字眼的話——意思是說，你我在工作上的價值，會由我們的創新與創意（創造力）、問題解決能力（理性）、看待事物的優先順序及如何對待其他人（倫理價值）所展現。大概還有一些我沒想到的「人類本質」也可以被放進來。\n\n但是有些人會接著擔憂的事情是，那AI是否可能有一天淘汰人類、或使人類退化到根本無法產出任何價值的境地呢？或許你腦中跳出了電影《瓦力》中那些只剩下一顆大頭和短小四肢的29世紀人類的畫面。不過我想那畢竟是個可愛版本的後末日圖像，如果真的有那一天來臨，那麼人類應該比較有可能變成《駭客任務》裡電腦母體的電池，而不是坐在自動運輸工具上的笑呵呵小胖子。\n\n若以比較認真的角度討論這點，我不認為有好理由相信人類真的會因為科技的過度發達而「用進廢退」成任何四肢短小的小胖子，原因倒也很簡單，因為經過700萬年演化而來的我們，作為「人類」的本質仍是不可能脫離身體的，換句話說，你的身體即是你的心智。\n\n我們知道讓小孩去外面跑跳蹦會對他的認知能力有幫助；我們知道賀爾蒙會影響我們的心情、慾望、以致思想；我們大概也可以想像三十歲的自己和六十歲的自己之所以用很不一樣的方式看待人生，一部份是因為經驗，另一部份是因為老化。科普書會用一些有趣的實驗證實所謂的「具身認知 (embodied cognition)」，但其實我們早就已經看過無數關於「身體跟心智無法分割」的例子，只是我們沒有深刻體會這件事而已。\n\n也許是我對技術太過無知，但這是為什麼我認為在根本上、人類不可能將自己的意識（或「靈魂」）移植到另一個載體上——我們的意識跟身體是無法分割的共同體。倘如沒有了這顆大腦、這個身體的感知、這組免疫系統和內臟器官、以及串連這一切的DNA，那所謂「你自己」真的還在那兒嗎？這並不是說我們的意識或自我無法超越身體、用身體之外的方式存在於這個世界，而是強調身體作為人類與世界互動的必要支點。\n\n這也是為什麼科學家在設計AI的過程中，發現如果需要讓AI能夠獲取人類世界的資訊，那麼「具身化 (Embodiment)」——亦即賦予AI近似人類的肢體或器官——是個必要的步驟，如果看過Boston Dynamics的機械狗，應該就略有所感。畢竟，我們身處的世界，就是個以「人類」這片拼圖的形狀，去往外開展開的一面超巨幅圖像；我們日常生活中接觸的多數事物，都是以你我作為使用者去建立的——轉頭看看你房間的門把就知道了。我們甚至可以說社會倫理也是類似的東西（但那是另一個話題）。\n\n我無法用我不熟悉的技術詞彙去描述「具身化」的概念，但我們可以用先驗的方法來瞭解人類如何認知這個世界。一如這個哲學問題說的：「假如一棵樹在森林裡倒下而沒有人在附近聽見，它有沒有發出聲音？」我認為答案是沒有，因為「聲音」這個詞的存在，其實隱含了「聽覺」的存在。基於同理，在一個沒有任何生物擁有「視覺」的宇宙裡，是沒有「看見」這回事的。\n\n所以要AI在這世界裡用近似人類的智慧運作，它們就必須先「具身化」以獲取人類在世界上運行的每分每秒都接收著的資訊。但獲得這些資訊還只是第一步，下一步更得讓AI學會如何做出「價值衡量」、進以完成人類會需要完成的任務。價值衡量意味著什麼？意味著AI終究必須碰觸倫理問題，因為人類的「智慧」就是建立在對無數資訊和事物的取捨之上，而什麼該取什麼該捨的「優先次序」問題，就是倫理問題。所以說，自動駕駛車要利用機械學習去辨認路標並不是件難事，難的是今天當左轉會撞到一個小孩、右轉會撞到一個老人、直踩煞車可能會害車上的市長命喪黃泉時，車子到底該往哪裡走。\n\nGoogle開發的Alphago已經在圍棋的對奕中展現了堪稱「創意」的驚人步數，我猜想AI在不久的將來也可能展現出極富「理性」的作為，而屆時，人類尚未被取代的本質還剩下什麼呢？我此刻的感覺是，那恐怕就剩下「道德」了。這也或許只是因為我不認為人類自己無法解開的道德難題，AI會有辦法解出來；又就算解了，AI的答案若不能被人類所接受，那我們真的會說那是個好答案嗎？「道德」這一關，在我看來確實是人類自己可以球員兼裁判、不可能被AI所取代的。\n\n\u003eConnecting

\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14\n[[後現代的價值真空]]\n\n---\n「樂觀虛無主義」表面上既符合科學事實、又通融人性需要，看似是個適合當代人類的生活態度，然而當我沿著它指引的方向走下去，我發現「樂觀虛無主義」幾乎是個太奢侈、太安逸、且帶著某種「道德健忘」的淺碟人生觀。\n\n原因如下：\n\n## 1.　它沒有真的論證人生為什麼值得活\n\n如果你身有殘疾、親人臥床、受飢貧或戰亂所困、生活在社會底層……你該如何看著自己了無意義的痛苦人生還樂觀得起來？無論虛無主義可以多樂觀，都無法帶給一個迫切需要希望的人足以活下去的動力。\n\n卡謬直指了問題的核心，他說：「真正嚴肅的哲學議題只有一個：那就是自殺。 判斷生命值不值得活，就等於回答了哲學最基礎的問題。」然而，世上多數人都不是擅長辯證生命荒謬與否的哲學家，就算能用最嚴謹完備的論證去解答「該不該自殺」這個終極哲學問題，也不會讓人類整體的生活方式有任何改變。人們依舊會希冀看見黑暗中的微光、找到支持他們去承擔生命苦難的堅毅。\n\n雖然「樂觀虛無主義」嘗試論證人的生命為什麼值得活，但我相信多數時候，它只會成功說服生活相對舒適、能歡欣鼓舞地喊出「Why not?」的樂天靈魂，卻無法在你我承受著無可避免的悲痛苦難時，為我們注入更多的堅忍和勇氣，甚至告訴我們如何用帶著尊嚴與祥和的姿態受苦——在「樂觀虛無主義」裡，這是個會被考慮的可能性嗎？\n\n## 2.　它沒有提供任何形式的道德指引\n\n承上，「樂觀虛無主義」要我們去做讓自己快樂的事、創造自己的人生意義、活出自己想要的生命，但這個樂天美好的個人主義宣言並沒有告訴我們應該如何對待他人、應該如何對待自己、以及為什麼我們該或不該在乎這些事。它迴避了關於價值和道德的「應然」問題，將問題留給每個人去自己思索，卻也沒有阻止你把這個問題當作不存在。\n\n如果我們都只是宇宙的塵埃，那麼就算我不是個有道德的塵埃又何妨？我又何需思考我這枚塵埃和其他宇宙塵埃之間的關係？我為什麼會有責任該去善待自己和他人呢？\n\n這些顯然都不是很有用的想法，因為關於「應然」問題的答案，才能指引我們在日常生活中貫徹一致的言行、在遭遇重大抉擇時看清前進的方向、在無可避免的苦難中幫助我們蛻變成更堅毅的自我。不知道或不去思考自己應該如何為人，等同心裡沒有個靶，一切言行都只是見機行事、無的放矢。\n\n為什麼要有一致的言行，為什麼不能見機行事？很簡單，因為一致的言行意味著我們秉持明確的價值觀去和現實世界磨合、在過程中辨明是非並修正錯誤，也使他人能夠信任我們；見機行事的結果是，你不會知道當下的成功是否僥倖、挫敗是否自找，所以無法複製良機、無法避開災厄，而他人更難以信任你。\n\n## 3.　它其實沒有回答如何創造生命意義\n\n「樂觀虛無主義」建議大家做自己會感覺良好的事，行有餘力可以順便扶老太太過馬路，但如果要你說這就等同於「創造生命的意義」，我相信你不會對自己的答案太有信心。\n\n確實，有許多天賦獨具的人能在全神貫注的創造性活動中得到豐沛的意義，但是更多人的生命意義，會來自於生產性活動（通常是工作）與責任的承擔（通常是家庭）——這既不是秘密、也不應該是個有爭議的事實。Victor Frankl在他的納粹集中營回憶錄《活出意義來》（Men's search for meaning）中也有類似的理解。\n\n在「樂觀虛無主義」裡，我們發現了人生並無目的，但基於某個未被說明的原因，我們執意得定義自己活著的意義，然而要創造什麼生命意義、如何創造這份意義、你創造的意義跟他人創造的意義之間有什麼關連……那就再說，總之就是可以自己創造就對了，畢竟尼采就是這麼說的。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E6%AA%A2%E9%A9%97%E8%AD%89%E6%93%9A%E8%88%87%E5%8B%95%E6%A9%9F":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Skeptic的Alex作為一個也同樣熱衷辯論信仰問題的無神論者，說他之所以如此關心這個問題、並樂於與信徒對話，就是因為「上帝的存在與否」是個對於人類生命的最重要問題，所以他熱衷於討論這個最高優先度的問題。）\n\n在資訊爆炸的時代裡，別輕易信服那些會「引用證據」說話的人，因為 **「引用證據」的過程是有品質差異的**。若引用觀測到極端值的寥寥幾個研究，便等同擁有了顛倒是非的能力，能輕易讓那些對證據和蒐證過程不夠有警覺心和判斷力的人上鉤。\n\n我們不只要關心證據說什麼，更要關心**證據背後的統計**、**蒐集證據的過程**（認知偏誤是非常容易犯的錯），避免被那些精挑細選出對自己有利證據的人所誤導。同樣地，我們要主動去搜索對立的證據，一個簡單的Google搜尋（但最好是用VPN或無痕模式）就能一定程度地告訴我們兩方證據的充分程度。\n\n然而有趣的是，也有人說當代的科學研究的趨同性太高，甚至像Nassim Taleb會說的，有些研究領域的研究者關心的已經不是自己的研究是否正確、對人類有用，而是其他同儕會不會認同自己——缺乏Skin in the game的研究，只會淪為學術小圈圈內自娛的譁眾取寵。真正有所突破的研究，應該是少數的、尚未被人們所接受、甚至受到一定程度排擠的。如果我們是在討論這樣的領域時，恐怕就非常難判斷證據的完整性。\n\n所以，當我們真的沒辦法判斷證據的完整性和精確性時，我會主張，我們該關心那些企圖論證的人**背後的動機、甚至是道德上的立場**。對此，我們只需要問兩個簡單的問題：「如果他說的是對的，哪些人會得利？」以及「他是否收取了利害相關人士的援助？」只要能回答這兩個問題，我們就有好理由選擇該相信或不相信對方。但同時，這絕對不代表我們在自己無法判斷證據完整性、但又不想相信對方時，就應該直接懷疑或指控對方的動機——這顯然是無益討論、搬弄是非的糟糕態度。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E6%B0%A3%E5%80%99%E9%81%8B%E5%8B%95%E5%AE%B6%E6%98%AF%E5%B0%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%80%E7%A8%AE%E4%BE%AE%E8%BE%B1":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n在大流行趨近尾聲之際，孩子們又回到公眾領域，Greta把未來的聲音又帶回了談判桌上——我們必須為後世的子孫留下一個更好的世界。\n\n但這些高談闊論並不是真的關於兒童或後代，它們更應該被理解作一種高調的現在主義——**透過將不遠的將來描繪成全人類的緊急狀態，這為今天的全球政治菁英在其公民頭上採取的各種政治及經濟決策，提供了完美的道德掩護。**\n  \n忘掉今天，忘掉此刻的公眾選擇；唯一重要的是「行動」，而唯一有能力行動的人，是那些握有權力的人。否則，這一切——根據Greta的說法——都只是 \"blah blah blah\"。\n\n這種論調很普遍，但它不能掩蓋一個事實：**透過民主決策去應對氣候變遷問題的時機實已成熟**——尤其當這個決策需要我們拿自己今天的生活和我們孩子的未來做出權衡時。現實是，我們看到的並不是讓選民長期參與的公眾辯論，而是全球政治菁英在抗議人士要他們「少說多做」的慫恿之下，卯起來想在為時兩週的論壇上完成他們的國際承諾。\n  \n不幸的是，這種聚焦於「未來」、省略了公民參與的大聲疾呼，具備了一定程度的吸引力。尤其因為年輕一代越來越相信公民主權不足掛齒，他們相信真正的改變只能指望那些有權力的人去實現。一位參加COP26（第26屆聯合國氣候變遷大會）罷學活動的學生說：「我們不會是能做出改變的人，我們只能呼籲改變必須發生。」——無知地預設了，實質的解決方案只可能是由上而下的。\n  \n隱含其中的是，**氣候運動家傳達了一種生活於「風險社會（risk society）」的情緒——在這個社會中，被放大檢視的威脅、不確定性、以及壓倒性的無力感，成為人類經驗的框架。** 風險社會的概念，是由社會學家Ulrich Beck和Anthony Giddens在20世紀末提出，用以描繪現代的全球化威脅將使自主個人再無用武之處的「歷史終結」情境。\n  \n從這個角度看，我們的社會所面臨的問題是不可克服的。當面對緊急的氣候危機時，唯一可行的解決方案是迅速的、全球性的重大措施；由單一國家的公民採取的民主決策，在最好的情況下會是無濟於事、在最壞的情況下會是適得其反的。\n  \n然而，我們當前面臨的危機，其實揭露了否定個人自主性的矛盾之處。\n\n在Covid大流行期間、以及現在的緊急氣候危機之下，當人們聽聞政治、科學、科技巨頭、和其他全球化機構的領導者所給出的鬼話連篇，隨之產生的是對風險社會的宿命論及生存主義心理。我們一面聽說Covid是前所未有的超級致命傳染病，一面聽說人類絕對可以根除這個病毒、戰勝疫情。但在氣候危機當前，宣稱我們就在「午夜前一分鐘」的誇張說法被當成藉口，認為我們有可能懸崖勒馬、在短短幾年內停止暖化並扭轉局面。\n\n這個願景帶給我們的是一種「新常態」：從今天的行動開始，我們要消除過去行動所產生的環境傷害、並重新出發。要實現這種「技術生存主義（techno-survivalism）」，只能經由公民承認自己的束手無策、並要求政治菁英們行使他們手中權力去做出改變。\n  \n波蘭社會學家Zygmunt Bauman在其2011年出版的《Collateral Damage》一書中預測了這種情況：在討論「權力與政治的分離」時，Bauman指出「**可行方案和預定目標之間的距離，被體現於『欠缺長期權力的政治』與『擺脫政治限制的權力』之間的永久拉鋸。**」\n\nBauman認為，在我們面臨的長期全球緊急狀態下，國家將被認為是無足輕重的；國家的民主制度要麼不適合、要麽沒有能力去推行需要發生的改變。選民們由於缺乏長期的權力，只能在一旁互相叫囂，而全球政治菁英們卻可以假「拯救明天」之名，自由自在地做任何符合他們當前利益的事情。當社運人士不惜一切代價要求各國政府有所作為、政治菁英們順水推舟地量產出他們的國際共識時，技術生存主義為有權有勢者提供了服務其自身利益的絕佳機會。\n\n如果Bauman是對的、而政治已經不具有任何意義，這實際上代表什麼？歸根結底，當我們的政治菁英們逐漸遠離其人民的同時，也也偏離了他們搞清楚自己應該做什麼的軌道，而這最終可能直通他們的垮台。正如Christopher Lasch在《The Revolt of the Elites》中所說的，通過將自己隔絕於社會整體，政治菁英們亦掏空了手中權力的合法基礎。\n\n在揮舞手中權力並因此獲益的同時，不受約束的菁英們更可能相信，個人自主性不復存在的世界仍可以正常運作——但這顯然是不可能的。\n\n在疫情期間，最初的「在家上班」命令很快就被大量的例外情況所抵銷，因為政府被迫承認有太多「必要」的工作需要人們外出；後來當企業主企圖勸說「在家上班」的人們回到辦公室，則遭受到冷漠的抗拒。同樣地，當COP26計畫的「綠色革命」縱然可以被強力施行，但仍舊需要人們的認同；人們在選擇換掉他們的汽車和鍋爐時，他們總是衡量著這對他們的生活品質有何影響。\n\n當人們對政治的信任度下降，他們就會找到其他更不容易被調解和控制的方式，來行使他們的權益。**對於政治菁英們來說，合法性是他們能握有權力的關鍵，而這需要他們在過去和現在之間建立合理的連結，而不是以「未來」之名消滅這個連結。**\n\nEdmund Burke在他的《Reflections on the Revolution in France》中優美地詮釋了這點：**社會應該被理解為一種「契約」、應該被慎重地看待，因為它不僅僅是關於當下的需求，它更是「在所有美德、所有美好事物上的夥伴關系」，它超越了任何特定一代人的貢獻，從而成為「不單單是活著的人之間的夥伴關系，更是活著的人、那些死去的人、以及那些尚未出生的人之間的夥伴關系」。**\n\n然而對於許多現代政客而言，這個世代間的契約只能通過撕裂過去、以未來之名立法來兌現。這種不受約束的權力揮舞或許在短期間能產生效益，但在某個時間點，這種無視過去、信任、自主公民的意識形態會反噬我們，而屆時，承擔後果的未必會是未來的人類，也可能就是現在還活著的我們。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%82%BA%E5%8F%97%E9%9B%A3%E8%80%85%E7%A5%88%E7%A6%B1%E7%9A%84%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E6%84%8F%E7%BE%A9":{"title":"","content":"tags:

我們既不會說拿多數人的當下福祉去換少數人的未來福祉是種「犧牲」，也不會說用當下比較多的福祉去換未來比較少的福祉是種「犧牲」。所以我們才會盡可能購買未來仍會保值、或至少對我們一樣有用的東西，而不會把消費力逐漸縮水的錢留在手上。\n\n要理解犧牲的概念，就必須認知其不可或缺的兩個要件：\n\n第一，是時間。如果說「失去」即是「過去的某個時間點我曾擁有，但現在我不再擁有」所呈現的落差，那麼「犧牲」就是「現在我有所付出（失去）、或未能享有某些東西，是為了在某個未來的時間點，我將擁有某些我現在沒有、且更值得的東西」。**沒有時間的概念，就沒有辦法觀察到因果關係；沒有正確的因果關係，就沒有正確的犧牲。**\n\n所以第二，是**對正確因果關係的認識**。過去是我們已經看過的，現在是我們眼前的，未來是我們無法看見的。在任何人親自驗證過一個犧牲行為將在未來兌現之前，沒有人真的知道現在的付出是否能產生未來的酬賞。若缺乏驗證，那麼說穿了就只是「賭賭看」而已。\n\n驗證的方式有很多，一種是看看前人已經做過什麼。已知的文明、傳統、宗教、乃至習慣和常理中，都有許多人類在歷史長河中不斷試錯、累積下來的一系列已驗證的、能被複製及流傳的犧牲行為：做好事有好報；以生兒育女的辛苦換取個人成長、生命意義、老年保障；對人有禮貌有公德心以換取他人未來的尊重和禮讓等。當然，這些犧牲行為不會總是百分之百能換得未來好處，但當社會中有越多人願意秉持信念去實踐，每個人能夠因此受惠的機率就會越高、並反過來強化大家對這種適度犧牲的信念，形成正向的循環。\n\n另一方面，當我們計畫採取的犧牲行為並不是他人驗證過的、或我們並不知道是否有人驗證過，這時運用經驗、知識、及理性去推論、評估、思辨，就會是必要的工作。這也是所謂「投資」和「投機」的差異：前者有一定程度的理據（至少對本人來說），後者則通常空有信念、結果為運氣左右。一個帶有「投資」意味的犧牲行為經過夠多人的驗證，便有機會成為風俗習慣、甚至深入傳統或文明的土壤。\n\n如果用「對正確因果關係」的不同認知程度去劃分，我們可以整理如下：古代宗教的「獻祭」，是人們普遍對因果關係有充足信念、但缺乏充足理據的犧牲行為；近代社會的禮俗、習慣、文化、傳統，通常是人們普遍對因果關係有充足信念、也有充足推論的犧牲行為（沒有充足推論的簡稱「迷信」）；個人或小群體的「投資/投機」行為，則是部份人對因果關係有充足信念、也可能有充足推論，但仍未說服多數人、或被大眾充分驗證的犧牲行為。\n\n然而，犧牲的信念並不總是隨處可尋。我們雖能夠驗證某個犧牲行為在無數前人生命中的運作，但仍然不會知道在自己的人生中，我們拿出來跟未來交易的籌碼是否夠具份量。就像我們一輩子看過無數生兒育女的父母親，但當今天為人父母的是自己時，我們仍不會知道自己是否配得上這個重擔、也無法預見自己在這條路上將有哪些獨特的遭遇。\n\n因此許多時候，「信仰的跳躍」乃是必要的。舊約聖經中，亞伯拉罕因信仰上帝而沉痛獻祭愛子的生命（在緊要關頭被天使阻止），因此通過信仰的考驗、成為上帝在世上的代理人——神話以某種極端戲劇性的角度向我們闡明，**或許我們並不總是知道當下的犧牲是否會有所回報，但我們往往更不明白自己固守的貪愛之物遠非生命至高的美好，也壓根無法想像有比現況要美好太多的回報在犧牲的另一頭等著。** 帶領人類跨越經驗、知識、理性的極限，踏入未知、實現想望、成就整體的，總是人心底層的這份信念。\n\n唯有對普遍的犧牲行為抱有足夠信念，人才有動機去成為正直、勤儉、善待自己和他人、具備遠見及美德的公民。否則，人便不會為更大的群體進行長遠考慮、不願以短期的付出和不便去換取未來回報，他們將耽溺於眼下好處和欲望的立即滿足，成為貪戀現狀、吝於付出的自私個人。各大宗教之所以總有某種賞善罰惡的終極原則，就是因為假如人不再相信讓當下自己稍微不方便、可以換取未來更大的酬賞，便會如杜思妥也夫斯基所言：「若無上帝，一切皆可為」。\n\n更重要的是，**若缺乏犧牲的信念，人將無法承受生命中必然的重擔與苦難、無法看見受苦的意義、也無法相信痛苦的另一頭會有平靜與和解。剩下的，只會是生命意義的失落、以及對上天的嘶啞控訴。**","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%8F%BE%E4%BB%A3%E6%96%87%E6%98%8E%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8%E7%84%A1%E6%B3%95%E4%B8%8D%E4%BB%B0%E8%B3%B4%E5%8C%96%E7%9F%B3%E7%87%83%E6%96%99":{"title":"","content":"tags:

20 世紀的水泥產量。另一方面，現在全世界一年消耗的水泥比整個 20 世紀上半葉還多。\n\n這四種要素如此迥異，但有三個共同點：它們難以替代、它們只會更被需要、它們的產出很大程度地取決於化石燃料的燃燒——也就是排放溫室氣體。\n\n值得思考的是，就連對再生能源的轉移也需要大量的鋼鐵、混凝土和塑膠。像風力發電機這種指標性的綠電象徵，其建材是鋼筋混凝土、塔架和軸承是鋼鐵、葉片是極耗能源生產且難以回收的塑料樹脂，而這些部件都需要特大卡車或輪船載運、並由大型吊車架設——理解了它的製成、運輸、組裝、和運轉，我們便很難說它是真正「綠色」的電力。\n\n另一方面，一台使用鋰電池、大約450公斤的電動車，含有約11公斤的鋰、近14公斤的鈷、27公斤的鎳、40多公斤的銅和50公斤的石墨——以及約181公斤的鋼，鋁和塑料。為一輛車提供這些材料，需要加工約40噸礦石，考慮到其礦石中許多元素的濃度較低，需要提取和加工約225噸原材料。\n\n積極電氣化公路交通的結果，只有可能是將上述的能源消耗以成千上萬輛的幅度提高。\n\n除非在提取、加工、運輸這些材料和產品的能源都能來自可再生能源之前，現代文明在根本上是不可能脫離這些要素所仰賴的化石燃料。\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%90%86%E6%83%B3%E4%B8%BB%E7%BE%A9%E8%80%85%E6%AC%A0%E7%BC%BA%E7%9A%84%E8%AC%99%E5%8D%91":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Self-Determination]]\n[[後現代的價值真空]]\n[[願景的衝突]]\n\n---\n當尼采聲稱上帝已死，他痛訴是我們殺死了祂，卻沒有像樣的東西可以填補這個「神形狀的真空」（帕斯卡）。\n\n尼采批判基督宗教的「此岸彼觀」——現世只是過渡、彼岸的理型才臻完美——是種敵視生命的觀點，因此在宣佈上帝已死之後，人類必須重新樹立生命價值、戰勝虛無主義。 \n\n如今，我們可以在社會文化中清晰觀察到尼采的重大影響，尤其是對彼岸理型的敵視。\n\n若以尼采可能偏好的措辭來說，現代人不再懦弱、迷信、低聲下氣地過著他們相信只是過渡的人生，苟且寄望著美好的來世；相反地，現代人勇敢、理性、昂首闊步地將此生過好過滿，相信自己來到此世本就帶著毋庸置疑的價值。\n\n假如過往的此岸彼觀是迂腐怯懦的，那麼現代人正巧展現了人類的勇敢和理性的展現；但換個角度，我們也可以說此岸彼觀使人類終其一生保持謙卑，而尼采為現代人帶來的，則是無須辯解的傲慢——或許熱愛古希臘文明的尼采並不會介意這個說法。 \n\n現代人經常秉持著「我們有能力將美好帶來此世」的信心，而這種理想主義使現代人樂意信任個人經驗和特定權威，反而不願意嚴謹地遵循權力分立和去中心化的系統性進程。\n\n海耶克說「通往地獄的路上撲滿了善意」，然而「充滿善意的干預」如今卻充斥於現代政治、文化、種族、經濟、能源等各種面向上。\n\n這也是湯瑪斯·索維爾在《觀點的衝突》討論的「Unconstraind Vision」——以理想主義看待人性，所以相信具有遠見和道德高度的人有資格引領並改變世界，也有責任剷除文化或體制中的敗壞陳腐。\n\n秉持這種信念的人，不願意相信系統性、去中心化、一步一腳印的集體進程，更難尊敬引領人類走到今天的文化根基。\n\n然而人類終究是部落主義的動物。\n\n現代人已經不再共同相信某種「人類無法企及之理想」的存在，而更傾向於堅持烏托邦「必須」在我們眼前被建立。於是尼采為我們帶來的「高貴的生命勇氣」，成為了二十一世紀這種無法妥協、為達目的不擇手段的理想主義。 \n\nJonathan Haidt指出演化為人類配備了「超越小我、融入大我」的宗教性趨向。\n\n對於現代人，任何東西——政治、種族、性向、環境——都可以成為宗教的替代品，只不過許多人相信自己是天選之人、要為此世創造一個無可妥協的烏托邦。\n\n或許，這個時代迫切需要的，是被我們連同彼岸和理型一起丟棄的那份謙卑。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%90%86%E6%83%B3%E6%98%AF%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E6%84%8F%E7%BE%A9%E7%9A%84%E5%89%8D%E6%8F%90":{"title":"","content":"tags:

[[理想]]、[[意義]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\n[[個人的價值階級]]\n[[對意義的渴望]]\n[[齊克果論人的存在]]\n\n---\n人活在世上，不可能不秉持著一套對自我、對世界、對人生風景的理想，因為無論我們做什麼、如何選擇、往哪兒去，都必定是在更宏觀的角度裡，試圖逼近自己心中的某種形式的「更好」、「更值得前往」的境地，無論那是你每一天把自己拖出被窩準備上班、和伴侶討論生小孩的計畫、或決定為照顧年邁母親而辭職搬回家鄉。\n\n生命的意義會彰顯於你與你所秉持的理想間的關係。意思是說，你內心理想的輪廓是否夠具體清澈、你是否願意立志於最崇高的人生目標、你以什麼樣的姿態付諸實行……這些都會決定你將在人生旅途中發掘多深刻的意義，以及當你遭遇逆境頓挫時是否能保持堅毅。\n\n如果沒有一個清晰的理想指引我們的生活、或無法看清楚自己應如何抵達那個「更好」的境地，我們便會裹足不前、動彈不得，甚至被生活的焦慮和危機感所籠罩。這是尼采名言「參透『為何』，才能迎接『任何』」的反面：一個人若無法參透自己為何而活，那麼他不但難以承擔生命的挑戰，更可能連生活的幸福愉悅都食之無味、無福消受。\n\n除此之外，每當我們發現自己無法擊中目標（例如領悟到自己不可能達成想要的成就）、甚至發覺自己設定的目標根本是錯的（例如驚覺自己為追求事業而錯過和小孩共度的時光），那更是我們最感到遺憾自責、失落懊悔的時刻——偏離目標 (Missing the mark)，在基督教中正是「罪」的原意。\n\n所以，在我們企望著意義的生命中，不容忽視的是你我所秉持的理想、以及我們為達至理想所採取的行動。而我們之所以熟悉自己的怠惰苟且、無法將自己視為有責任幫助的對象，便是因為太多時候，我們的良知其實拿著某個我們拒絕承認卻無法擺脫的理想來跟自己比較。我們的自我批判正是源自你我和心中的「理想自我」間無法漠視的差距。\n\n現代人經常相信可以「創造自己的價值」，亦即自由地選擇要相信什麼作為自己最高的理想，但事實是我們根本做不到。如果一個人真能創造自己的價值，那麼想當然爾，他最輕鬆愜意的生活方式就是讓他的良知永遠對自己言聽計從、沒有一秒鐘需要懷疑自己是否做得夠好或做錯了。但顯然，我們的理想與良知並不是全然由自己掌控，反而更像是依循著某種舉世皆然、不證自明的自然法理；你的良知對你的警告、跟我的良知對我的訓誡，經常是同大於異。這一定程度上呼應了榮格的「良知是上帝的聲音」一說。\n\n個人與其理想間的關係，解釋了宗教信仰被遺忘的深刻意涵：宗教崇拜，是人類數千年來對於某種大家共同相信的「理想存有」（理想的價值或理想的人類原型）的傳頌；宗教的教義，則是信徒用來自我修正、以微薄之力去體現和致敬這個「理想存有」的依歸，亦可視為歷代人類以生命經驗去累積出的、通往理想生命的地圖。\n\n雖然現代人習慣將宗教傳統斥為迷信，但拋棄了生命地圖的結果，卻是二十一世紀人類所面臨的深刻孤獨和焦慮。這也顯示了，世俗的現代人在更深的意義上並不是真正地相信虛無主義或無神論，比較常只是拒絕具體地思考什麼值得作為「理想」、自己又該為達至「理想」做出哪些犧牲和改變。\n\n然而，抗拒對生命理想的思考並不會使你的良知噤聲，假裝自己「已經夠好了」也不會真正讓你安然自得，因為我們無法擺脫對生命意義的需要，而生命意義必然會在你邁向理想的實踐中產生。齊克果所謂的「真正的人生是『宗教性』的人生」，我想與此無異。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E6%84%8F%E7%BE%A9%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%AC%E8%B3%AA":{"title":"","content":"tags:

\n[[對意義的渴望]]\n\n---\n如果追根究底，其實不難發現「樂觀虛無主義」在語意上是個矛盾的概念。\n\n當你知道1+1＝2，你不會問「這樣是好還是壞」或「這是應該發生的嗎」。如果我們用真正的虛無主義觀點去看待人類的存在、真的以百分之百的客觀理性行事，那麼在得知「人生本無意義」的客觀事實之後，我們並沒有理由接著辯解「為什麼我應該／不應該繼續活著」。追問「為什麼要做任何事情」或「為什麼不做點什麼」都是不必要的反射性問題；接著思考自己「應不應該自殺」也同樣是不必要的抉擇。\n\n「樂觀虛無主義」就像是聲稱你相信「善良的數學公理」，你一手高舉客觀事實、另一手卻為之強加了主觀的信念。\n\n不過不同於數學公理，「虛無主義」描述的是一個關於人類生命的根本事實、一個直接挑戰了你我存在本質的尖銳論調。作為一個「意識」的本體，你可以一輩子都對數學公理和一籮筐的其他事物恍若未聞，但你不可能對自身的存在毫無自覺——這個事實只是「我思故我在」的倒裝句罷了。\n\n所以「樂觀」的主觀態度和「虛無」的客觀事實這兩個在技術上互不相容的詞彙，卻能毫無矛盾地共存於許多人的生命觀，是因為經由人類的自我意識，許多事物得以存在於「應然」和「實然」、「主觀」和「客觀」、「價值」和「物質」交疊的灰色地帶裡。\n\n舉例而言，道德、新點子、意識形態等「非實際存在」的事物能以有形且有脈絡的方式左右物質世界的運作和資源分配，而農耕工具、印刷術、iPhone等「實際存在」的東西也都用非常具體的方式扭轉了人類世界的心智、價值、和秩序。廣受好評的《人類大歷史》（Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind）更是鉅細靡遺地描繪了人類如何透過對上帝、金錢、國家等「不存在」事物的「共同想像」，進行大規模的合作、帶來驚人的文明進步。\n\n但身在如此宏大深遠的文明長河之中，你如何能說道德、價值、甚至金錢和國家等事物都只是不真實的想像物呢？難道我們該相信是這些「不存在」的東西幾千年來在地球上開疆闢土倒海移山的嗎？\n\n或許我們真正該反思的是，「何謂真實」這個問題其實遠比我們所想的要深刻細微且包羅萬象。\n\n綜合上述，其實「生命意義」的問題打從一開始就不是純粹的「實然」問題、不是一個能被客觀觀察的科學事實；發現人類在宇宙中的渺小進而相信人生並無意義，那也只是你對生命意義的主觀詮釋。\n\n「意義」是一個存在於「應然」的、我們摸不著也看不見的信念，但它能具體地指引你我每分每秒的優先次序、情緒感受、時間分配。看見生命的意義與否，能決定一個人選擇耽溺自艾和寬宏堅毅，繼而用非常實質的方式影響他和他周遭他人的生命經驗——這個你我都能親自驗證的區別，向我們證明了「意義」的「真實」。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E6%AC%8A%E5%8F%8D%E5%A2%AE%E8%83%8E%E8%AB%96%E9%BB%9E":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[政治]]、[[墮胎]]、[[神聖個人]]、[[親職]]、[[道德]]\nRef: [[Stephanie Gray - Pro-Life Arguments]]\n\n---\n\n- ### 先總結支持墮胎的立場 \n\t- 支持墮胎的立場，歸結於身體自主權。我們（美國）是一個痴迷於自主權的文化，痴迷於擁有選擇和控制的權利。因此，支持墮胎的人會說這是關於我的身體自主權，我控制我的身體的權利。如果我想墮胎，亦即我將自己的身體交付到墮胎醫生的桌上，那麼我應該有權利被允許這麼做。\n\n\n- ### 墮胎並非僅涉及婦女的身體\n\t- 我們知道，當婦女進行墮胎時，涉及的不僅僅是她的身體。當一個婦女做了驗孕，她並不想懷孕，而測試結果為陰性，她會去墮胎診所嗎？ 顯然不會。但是如果測試結果是陽性，而她不想懷孕，那麼她會考慮去墮胎診所嗎？ 是的，這就會是她考慮的選項。 \n\t  \n\t- 驗孕的陰性結果，基本上是在說：這只是你的身體、這裡只有你而已，不用擔心。但當她的驗孕結果呈陽性時，這就告訴她這不再只是她的身體，這裡還有「另一個身體」，所以她才會考慮要墮胎——一個假如今天結果是陰性時她便不會採取的行動。\n\t  \n\t- 那麼，這位婦女現在在考慮墮胎的事實，等同於承認了有另一個身體存在。那麼我們該問的是，那「另一個身體」的身體自主權呢？那個人類的選擇呢？我確實可以選擇把我的身體放到墮胎醫生的桌上，這是一個選擇，然而當我懷孕了，這件事情就會影響另一個身體。如果我相信一個人的身體權利，我就需要保護那個尚未出生的人的身體權利。\n\t  \n\t- 婦女在懷孕時的所有生理反應，都是因為有另一個身體的存在。如果這裡存在著另一個身體，那麼我們怎麼對待這個身體、跟我們「應該」對待這個身體，就存在著重要的區別。如果真的要，我幾乎「可以」做任何事情，但我們真正該問的是，某些事情是否是我們身在一個相信人人生而平等、相信基本人類生命權的文明社會中「應該」做的事？\n\n\n- ### 回應「胚胎非人類」論點\n\t- 普林斯頓大學的教授Peter Singer認為，所謂一個「人」，應具備理性、意識或自我覺知。因此，墮胎的支持者會說，懷孕前幾周的胚胎、甚至懷孕前三個月的胎兒雖然在生物學上是人，但這個實體並不具備理性、意識或自我覺知，所以即使在生物學上是人，它也不是人。\n\t  \n\t- 讓我們假想，如果我們對人的定義——那個賦予你生命權、不允許我我殺死你的定義——是建立在你的理性、意識、或自我覺知之上，那麼當你被打了麻醉正在接收手術的時候呢？在手術進行中，你並沒有理性、意識、或自我覺知，如果我那時問你說「我可以殺了你嗎」，你沒辦法回應「不，請不要殺我」。又假如你正在睡覺，我在你睡覺時輕聲說「我可以殺了你嗎」，你也不會拒絕，因為在那一刻裡你並沒有理性、意識和自我覺知。\n\t  \n\t- 即便如此，我們當然仍承認你是一個人，因為你的內在確實具備了理性、有意識、能自我覺知的能力，儘管你可能因為睡眠或被麻醉的情況而無法彰顯這些特質。\n\t  \n\t- 所以同樣地，擁有人類父母的胚胎或胎兒，他就是個人，在其本性中也具備了理性、意識、自我覺知的能力，僅因為他的年齡而暫時無法顯露。當你在睡覺時，你不能彰顯這些特質出來，但這可以很快地改變；對胚胎來說，那是因為他的年齡而無法表現，但這仍將將隨著胚胎年齡的增長而改變。很顯然地，我們的生命權應該以我們的存在為基礎，而不是以我們的年齡大小為基礎。\n\t  \n\t- 所以我會說，殺死一個人是錯誤的，不是因為這個人被殺死時是否能夠感到痛苦、當時是否有意識，而是因為被殺的個體是一個人類。一個未出生的嬰孩是否感到痛苦、是否有意識、是否能做出反應，因此並不重要。\n\t  \n\t- 這是為什麼我喜歡引用聯合國的參考資料回應墮胎的支持者：聯合國經常被認為是個支持墮胎的機構，但如果你看看他們的基本文件，會發現他們是深刻地支持生命的。《世界人權宣言》說：人類家庭的所有成員都有生命權。然後他們在第6條說：每個人都應該被承認在法律面前的人格。我們該問，誰是「每個人」？我們沒有理由反對未出生的胚胎也因擁有人類的父母而成為人類家庭的成員，所以第6條也適用於他們，就像適用於你和我一樣。作為人類家庭的成員，他們在任何地方都應該在法律面前被承認是個人。\n\n\n- ### 回應「生命何時開始」的不可知論者\n\t- 有些人會說他們不知道生命何時開始，而我會反問他們會在懷孕到第幾週第幾個月時禁止墮胎手術的進行。如果他們在懷孕六個月或出生時禁止墮胎，那麼他們就等同承認了生命從那時候開始，否則他們不會由那時起禁止墮胎。所以當他們聲稱他們不知道生命何時開始，他們仍通過劃定禁止墮胎的界限來描述了他們的答案。\n\t   \n\t- 那麼問題來了，你是根據什麼來確定生命的開始呢？是六個月？還是生命從出生開始？即使你認定是六個月這個數字，這個時間戳記其實也意味著我們認為六個月前發生了一些重要的事情，讓我們開始計算時間的流逝、看著時鐘滴答作響然後說「哦，滿六個月了」。如果受精是發生在三個月前，那我們為什麼假裝三個月後生命才起跑，而不是在精子卵子融合的那一刻呢？\n\t  \n\t- 有一篇科學論文《人類的生命何時開始》是由醫生和研究人員Maureen Condic博士所著。在論文中，她為生命從受精開始提出了一個驚人的理由：當我們有一堆細胞，並想知道這些細胞彼此間是相同還是不同的，科學家有兩個標準：細胞組成，與細胞行為。 \n\t  \n\t- 當你看一個精子細胞時，它的成分是父親的遺傳物質；當你看一個卵子時，它的成分是母親的遺傳物質。於是我們知道精子和卵子是不同的細胞，因為成分不同。現在讓我們看看其行為：當精子存在並活著時，它會游去尋找卵子並使其受精；當卵子存在並活著，它就坐在那等待精子的穿透。所以通過行為，我們亦可以看到精子細胞和卵子細胞彼此不同。 \n\t  \n\t- 接著讓我們根據單細胞胚胎或胎兒的標准來看看，這個胚胎或胎兒是跟精子卵子一樣的嗎？由組成的角度，在精子卵子融合的時刻，這個實體中就已經同時擁有了母親和父親的遺傳物質。即便兩個染色體的遺傳物質尚未交融，它們也都已經被包含在這個細胞中，所以通過成分我們知道我們正在處理不同的東西。從行為的角度，如果單細胞胚胎和卵子細胞相同，它就會允許被穿透；如果單細胞胚胎和精子相同，它就會游來游去，但觀察它的行為，我們看到它與精子細胞或卵細胞皆不相同。 \n\t  \n\t- 因此，我們知道實質上有新東西已經出現，而在精子與卵子融合之前，我們並沒有觀察到這些東西。這個新東西、這個胚胎，就是人類父母的下一代。\n\t  \n\t- 所以如果有人說，我不知道什麼時候禁止墮胎，因為我真的不知道生命何時開始，那麼我會說兩件事：第一，我會給他們關於生命開始於受精的科學依據，但第二，我會說如果我們不知道，我們不是更該謹慎行事嗎？如果你要炸掉一棟舊房子，炸藥都準備好了，但有人說：「我們還不確定是不是所有人都安全離開了，可能還有人在裡面。」你會說「但無論如何我們都要炸掉它」，還是說「在我們確定之前，誰都不許引爆」呢？\n\t  \n\t- 聲稱「我不知道生命何時開始」和聲稱「這裡沒有生命」是不同的。如果有人認為我們不能明確地說這裡沒有生命，那麼我們都該同意，應該要謹慎行事才對。\n\n\n- ### 回應「拯救人類嬰兒或冷凍胚胎」的思想實驗\n\t- 有人提出一種思想實驗：在一場大火中，你必須抉擇要救出一個人類嬰兒，還是救出二十個冷凍的人類胚胎，只能二選一。對於幾乎所有人，都會毫不猶豫地回答救出人類嬰兒。有人因此結論說所以人類嬰兒和胚胎的生命價值並非等值的，否則我們應該要選擇救出二十個冷凍胚胎。\n\t\n\t- 我認為我們多數人都會選擇人類嬰兒，是基於兩個原因：第一，我們可能對孩子有更多的感情——一種很自然的感情——我們也許都抱過、撫慰過或與嬰兒玩耍過； 但第二，是對成功率的分析。\n\t  \n\t- 當你分析這個情境，你會想說如果我救出這個孩子、把他帶出大樓，我不僅在這一瞬間救了這個孩子，而且這個孩子會繼續活下去。然而當我思考要帶著二十個冷凍胚胎跑出大樓時，就可能有許多變數了：首先我可能會擔心它們解凍而死亡，所以如果我把它們帶出大樓，它是否需要接上什麼東西才不會死掉？即使我能夠以某種方式使用發電機、或任何需要的東西來保持它們的冷凍狀態，它們事後是否會被植入母親體內，或者它們是否應該被植入，這都是完全不同的倫理困境。所以除了我們普遍跟嬰兒的情感聯繫之外，也牽涉到實際拯救生命的成功率。\n\t  \n\t- 一旦你開始分解這個情況，你就會發現這不是一個關乎墮胎的案例。無法拯救並不等同於直接殺害，更不是說如果我今天在大火中二選一沒有救你，你的價值就低於我所救的那個人。\n\n\n- ### 回應因母親生命危急的墮胎需要\n\t- 我們現在知道，作為一個孕婦，這涉及著另一個人的存在，而且是種非常特殊的關係——對於脆弱一方的養育和照顧。\n\t   \n\t- 當我們因母親生命危急而必須討論是否要採取墮胎手段時，我們首先要瞭解到，這件事情必須涉及了兩個生命——母親和孩子——他們在我們心目中擁有同樣的價值，我們認知到他們都是不可重複亦不可替代的；母親不比孩子更重要，孩子不比母親更重要，他們是平等的。\n\t  \n\t  但在此同時，我們也認識到其中一方更容易受到傷害，即年幼的胎兒。這個孩子實際上依賴於母親——雖其生命的價值與母親平等，但他依賴母親生存。因此，如果我們想在懷孕的大部分時間裡保護孩子的生命，我們實際上需要保護母親的生命。\n\t  \n\t- 然後我會說，為了釐清我們該如何回應緊急情況，我們應該認知到有一些我們可以採取的途徑是不道德的。儘管這些途徑對我們來說並不開放，也並不意味著我們找不到其他可採取的、有道德的途徑。想像你今天開車回家時，遇到一個巨大的橘色標誌，上頭寫著道路封閉、前方繞行，那麼你會逼不得已繞經這個社區才能回到你家。\n\t  \n\t- 因此，基於同理，當婦女的生命處於危險之中時，我們當然想達到挽救她的生命的最終目標，但這裡也存在著一個此路不通的障礙——有一條路是不對我們開放的，那就是直接且蓄意地結束孩子的生命，因為直接且蓄意地結束一個無辜人類的生命，是錯誤的。\n\n\n- ### 回應性侵懷孕案件的墮胎\n\t- 對於性侵懷孕的事件，我們需要採取兩種做法：一種是心靈層次的，另一種是頭腦層次的。我們需要從前者開始，我們必須承認任何受到性侵害的人都是受害者，他們都受到了創傷；那是一種殘酷的攻擊行為，我們無法用言語來形容它的邪惡卑劣。雖然我不能說我親身經歷過，但我透過身邊朋友的經歷，近距離觀察到它對那些經歷過的人的影響，我可以承認這是一件可怕的事情。那些受到傷害的人需要我們的支持，他們需要我們的愛，我們的同情心，還有心理諮商等等協助。\n\t  \n\t- 接下來我們要從心靈移動到頭腦的層次。在表達我們的同理心之後，我們該引入邏輯，並問出這個問題：墮胎會解除強姦受害者的痛苦嗎？你可能會說，墮胎並不會減輕他們的痛苦，但不將性侵懷孕的胎兒生下來，我們就能消除這個殘酷的提醒。換言之，總是會有那些提醒著受害者傷痛的東西，而我們得承認即使我們將「胎兒」這個特定的提醒拿走，也不可能完全消除所有其他的提醒、就不會有東西讓受害者想起他所受的痛苦。\n\t  \n\t- 我想提出的下一個問題是，對無辜的孩子判處死刑是否公平呢？一般來說，支持墮胎的人通常不支持死刑，（在美國）這些人也不會對強姦犯判處死刑，甚至不會對殺人犯判處死刑。所以我們要問，如果你不會對有罪的人判處死刑，為什麼你會考慮對無辜的人判處死刑？在強姦的情況下，有罪的一方不是胎兒，有罪的一方不是婦女，有罪的一方是強姦犯。\n\t  \n\t  因此，我們現在談論的墮胎行為，是為無辜的一方加諸後果、加諸一個我們甚至不考慮判處罪犯的懲罰。又即使我們願意判罪犯死刑，我們也應該都同意，沒有無辜的人應該為他們自己沒有犯下的罪行付出代價。\n\t   \n\t  所以墮胎並不能解除對強姦受害者的傷害，也不能消除她受到創傷的記憶，而且最根本的是，一個支持人權的社會，不應該對一個實際上沒有犯罪的個人處以任何懲罰，因為他們是無罪的。\n\t  \n\t- 值得深思的是，如果在同一個國家裡有兩個女人，她們都犯了罪，而根據該國法律，她們都得被判死刑。然而其中一個女人懷孕了，另一個女人沒有懷孕，那麼有趣的結果會是，腹中胎兒的存在能夠使他的母親免於死刑。其中關鍵便是我們承認了在她的身體裡有個無辜、無罪的一方，我們不應該為他們沒有犯下的罪行而殺害他們。\n\n\n- ### 回應「知名小提琴家」思想實驗\n\t- 《一個支持墮胎的論證》(A Defense of Abortion)由Judith Jarvis Thomson發表的1971年，其中最知名的「知名小提琴家」思想實驗，用於推翻「生命權比身體自主權重要」的論點。 內容如下：\n\t  \n\t  「有一位知名的小提琴家生病了，他需要輸血才能繼續活下去。但是，他血型特殊，不是每個人都能捐血救他。小提琴家的粉絲們不知從哪裡得知，你是唯一一個能輸血救他的人。於是，他們趁你熟睡的時候，綁架了你。醫生不知道事情的來龍去脈，就把你放在他旁邊，讓你輸血給他。你醒來時，發現你正在輸血給小提琴家，維持他的生命。這時候，你有權利可以離開，不要救小提琴家嗎？\n\t  \n\t  你一離開，小提琴家沒有你的血，他就會死。他有權利要求你留下來嗎？」\n\t  \n\t  聽完這個思想實驗，大部分人的反應是基於我們的身體自主權，我們有權離開、不救這個小提琴家。結論是，即使一個人有生命權、或是「活下去的權利」，也並不代表他就能限制他人的身體自主權。\n\t  \n\t- #### 討論自願情形\n\t\t- 首先，在小提琴家的案例中，你是被綁架的，未經你的同意就被綁在這個人的身邊。但在絕大多數情況下，婦女懷孕時，她們是同意性行為的。由於懷孕是一個性行為的可能後果，她們必須接受。（此即回應因節育失敗而產生的墮胎需求。）\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 就像你和你的小孩在街上打棒球，你小孩打到了球，球穿過了你鄰居的窗戶，你不能對你的鄰居說「我只同意要打棒球，沒有同意球會打破你的窗戶，所以我不需要負賠償責任」。如果你的鄰居把你告上法庭，他就能辯稱，你在有玻璃的地方打棒球，就自然有打破別人窗戶的潛在風險。所以當你選擇要在這個場域打棒球，我們就視同你已經認知這樣的風險，因此你必須接受後果，付錢替鄰居修窗戶。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 或者想像一對男女發生了性關係，後來他們分手了，女人發現自己懷孕，並希望把孩子生下來。如果做完親子鑑定，發現當初的男人確實是小孩的生父，她就有權向男人要求孩子的撫養費。那個男人可不能說：「我只同意跟你發生性關係，沒有同意要讓妳懷孕，所以我不會付任何一毛錢」，因為如果女人就此事將他告上法庭，法庭必定會做出對她有利的裁決——由於男人參與了性行為、創造了這個後代，他就必須承受相關的後果和義務，亦即幫助這個有經濟及生活需求的脆弱個體，並且支付孩子的撫養費。假如對男人這樣的期望是合理的，那麼我們就不能說對女人有此期望是不合理的。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 若回到小提琴家的案例中，我們需要重申一個重點：父母對他們的後代有責任，而我們對陌生人沒有責任。所以，我和小提琴家被一起綁在床上的性質是，我不認識這個人，所以要我用我的身體幫助他，是一件值得稱許的事，但並非我的義務、我的道德責任。然而當事情涉及到懷孕時，這就關乎父母與子女間的關係。\n\t\t  \n\t- #### 討論非自願情形\n\t\t- 讓我們接著討論非自願——比方說性侵懷孕——的情形。在這個情境裡，雖然他們沒有同意導致懷孕的行為，但由於在生物學上是孩子的父母——強姦受害者是孩子的母親——他們便有責任照顧他們的後代，這份責任並不是用於陌生人。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  如果一個孩子在你的城市裡挨餓，你去收容所工作並提供食物是樁美事，但如果你不去收容所當志工以幫助那些挨餓的兒童或成年人，你也沒有犯法。然而，如果你家裡的孩子在挨餓，而你拒絕給孩子提供食物，你會在法律上和道德上就有了疏於照顧的問題。\n\t\t\n\t\t- 所以說，在父母與子女的關係中，我們總是有責任幫助弱勢的一方。強姦之所以是錯誤的，是因為脆弱的一方受到強大的一方傷害；墮胎之所以是錯誤的，是因為脆弱的一方受到強大的一方傷害。我這麼說，絕對不是要粉飾性侵害的嚴重性和創傷，而是為了說明，當不公義、可怕的事件發生時，它並沒有給受害者許可，讓他們用任何他們想要的方式來回應。 \n\t\t  \n\t\t- 於是我會主張，性侵害的受害者懷孕後不必撫養孩子。問題是在那個時間窗口中、在沒有其他人可以撫育這個胎兒的情況下，是否存在著責任去滿足孩子的基本需求呢？\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 想像你和一個新生嬰兒一起被綁架。醒來之後你發現你出不去，也不曉得自己在哪裡，奇怪的是在這個小空間裡，有水、有營養品、有說明書、有所有你所需要哺育這個小嬰兒的東西。在這個情況下，雖然你也是綁架的受害者，但你並不需要什麼偉大的英雄美德才能夠滿足這個嬰兒的基本需求，因為同為受害者，他是個更脆弱、無法自力更生的個體，而你只是在做一件正確的事。我們也都會同意，當你能從這種情況中被解救出來時，你自然不該有責任繼續撫養這個孩子。\n\t\t  \n\t- #### 討論「基本需求」與器官的本質\n\t\t- 現在，墮胎的支持者會說，既然你被綁架也有責任哺育手邊的小嬰兒，那麼難道你不應該幫助跟你綁在一起的小提琴家嗎？你與那個孩子沒有血緣關係，你與小提琴家也沒有關係。然而這裡仍然存在著重要的差異，亦即人的基本需求與特殊需求。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 讓我們用另一個可能更彰顯身體自主權的情境來討論：想像你有一個長大了的孩子，你非常地愛他。在某個時間點，他因為腎臟病重病不起，除非他接受腎髒移植，否則就會死。很剛好地，你是世界上唯一一個適合移植腎臟給他的人。身為父母的你，把一個腎臟捐出來給你孩子，不是一樁美事嗎？當然，因為這會救了你孩子的生命，而且你有兩顆腎臟，所以這也不會要你的命。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  於是，支持身體自主權的人會說，你看，即便這個人是你的孩子也一樣、即使這是一個慷慨且正確的行為，法律也沒有要求我們一定要捐贈我們的腎給自己的孩子，因為我們沒有捐贈器官、或將自己的器官讓給他人使用的道德義務。所以在母親的情況下，也不應該被法律規範她有義務將身體讓予胎兒使用。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 要回應這種說法，我們必須問自己的問題是，腎臟的性質和目的是什麼，而子宮的性質和目的又是什麼？因為當我們問出、並回答這個問題時，我們就會明白為什麼父母不應該在法律上有義務給予其中一個，而實際上應該在法律上有義務給予另一個。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  腎臟，它存在於我的身體裡，是為我而存在，但子宮卻非常不同。子宮存在於我的身體裡，每一個月，它都在為了「另一個人」的身體做準備；每一個月，我的子宮內膜都在增厚，僅僅在等待著孕育後代的機會。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  因此，你可以說子宮迥異於其他的身體器官，因為它更大程度上是為了我們的後代而存在，而不是我們自己。這是為什麼我們的後代有權「使用」這個器官，而已經出生的孩子卻不能要求得到我們的腎臟。\n\t\t  \n\t\t- 我們應該會同意，作為父母親，我們有責任去滿足孩子的基本需求。帶孩子去迪士尼玩，那是特殊需求；提供孩子食物、衣服、住所，那是基本需求。在懷孕的情況下，維持懷孕、允許胎兒住在子宮中——子宮存在的本質，就等同於胎兒的食物、衣服、和住所——這就是對於一個胎兒來說的基本需求。\n\t\t  \n\t\t  所以我認為，建立在親子關係、子宮的本質、以及胎兒的基本需求之上，我們有責任照顧尚未出生的胎兒。當討論到知名小提琴家時，那是超越職責的特殊需求。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%94%B1%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E7%B5%84%E6%88%90%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%A8%E6%9C%9F%E7%A4%BE%E7%BE%A4":{"title":"","content":"tags:

**「婚姻的基礎是什麼」的道德前提**，而我們這一世代人已經非常習慣相信婚姻所需的唯一基礎就是「兩個相愛的人」，尤其被同婚運動強力地提醒之後。\n\n然而，我也不是要主張「結婚是兩個家庭的事情」。台灣和許多其他儒家社會一樣，正經歷從東方的儒家觀念（兩個家庭的事）轉化到西方的基督教觀念（兩個人自己的事）的過程，世代間觀念的隔閡和摩擦實是文化變遷下的必然。我並不覺得一個比另一個更好，重點是大家要有共識比較好。\n\n---\n所以親友問我說什麼心態，我說是「**準備好要承擔彼此成為家人後的責任**」。\n\n我不敢說這是婚姻的完美解答，但這是我現在能想到的最好的答案，也是我能給自己做的最好的準備。\n\n成為家人後的責任是什麼？這沒有標準答案，因為每一對伴侶對「家庭」的想像都不盡相同、雙方家庭也會賦予各自的期待，每一個在婚姻關係中的人如何迎接、回應這些期待，都是自己人生的功課。\n\n但絕對不會變的是，**主動去承擔這些責任**永遠會比被動接受來得好太多。\n\n而這才是一對伴侶在結婚前就該琢磨清楚的：彼此對於家庭的想像是什麼？彼此對對方作為家人有什麼期待和要求？雙方家庭是否會有額外的期待和要求，彼此又是否願意承擔和回應？彼此是否期待對方為自己的家庭做點什麼？甚至，彼此對於扶養小孩的想像是什麼？雙方是否有一致的價值觀和教養原則，能夠在擔任親職的工作上有充分的共識和合理的分配？\n\n更重要的是，**雙方是否有共識、都願意主動承擔這些伴隨婚姻而來的責任**？假如沒有，我們如何能保證這段婚姻不會變成充滿怨懟的獨角戲？假如我們只是相信「相愛」便足夠、就足以為我們找到走下去的答案，我們又如何能保證有一天不會突然發現自己「不愛了」？\n\n有了對彼此的理解及共識、做好了自己的心理準備，我們才可能有**勉強夠多的智慧**去迎接婚姻這堂一輩子的課題，在柴米油鹽的消磨之下苦心經營這份得來不易的愛情。否則，一切都只是天真浪漫的豪賭一把罷了。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83%E7%9A%84%E5%83%B9%E5%80%BC%E9%9A%8E%E7%B4%9A":{"title":"","content":"tags:

-\n無論在家庭、學校、軍隊、或職場，我們隨時都在摸索著當下身處之群體的目標為何、秩序是如何建構、人與人之間的關係是什麼，進以衡量自己的所在位置、用適當的方式言行。唯有如此，我們才能發現自己在群體中的功能和角色、發揮個人的所長、定義自身存在（之於當下群體）的價值——「社會化」正是一個人將「個體目標」向「群體目標」校準對齊的過程，它從我們牙牙學語以來就從未停止過。\n\n一間公司的共同目標若是「創造最大利潤」，那麼公司內的每一個人都需要被放在能夠成就這個目標的位置、各司其職，你跟其他人應該如何合作互動都會得到定義和規範，你也會被賦予相對應的使命和職責、定義著你之於這個群體的存在意義。同樣地，一個家庭裡的共同目標若是「和諧安康」，那麼家庭成員就必須為此齊心協力、扮演好各自的角色、充分認知到自己能夠為家庭創造的貢獻。\n\n這是為什麼在一個健康的企業文化下，思考「你可以為公司創造什麼價值」往往是對你有利無害的策略；這是為什麼在家中長輩重病時，理想狀況是家庭成員們都能清楚自己可以做點什麼，有錢出錢、有力出力；這更是為什麼對於一個社會新鮮人或家中小孩來說，他能替自己做的最壞打算，就是當一個難以合作、沒人喜歡、凡事只想到自己的自私鬼（我並不是說職場老鳥或家中長輩就有資格這麼做）。\n\n由此可見，所謂的社會階級——人在群體中的定位、專責、管理機制——就是眾人一起相信「某些東西比其他東西更重要」、奉行一系列共同的價值階級所產生的結果。\n\n當代名著[《人類大歷史》](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010774982)中最重要的論點之一，是人類如何運用「共同想像」去匯集超過單一部落的群眾、以完成唯有眾志成城才可能實現的巨大成就。在宗教組織、政治制度、金融系統等成功讓大量人類有效合作的「共同想像」背後，都蘊含了 「某些事物比其他事物更重要」 的前提：人們學會相信「某個神」、「某種政治理念」、「某些可交易的籌碼」比其他同類型的東西還更重要、更需要被捍衛、更適合作為引領眾人的指標。\n\n中國清朝亦有統計結果顯示，當遭逢飢荒時，宗祠林立的地區的動亂次數明顯少於那些只有零星宗祠的地區

[2]\n\n如果你細數自己一天中在每一個場合裡跟每一個人的互動，然後追根究底地探問「為什麼我用這種方式面對這個人」、「我為什麼在另一個情境下是那樣對待另一個人」，你得到的答案大多會是「不知道啊，好像就應該要這樣」。但今天當你去到一個文化迥異的國家時，你大概會深刻地感受到文化衝擊，並驚覺自己原本的日常生活中有多少人際互動是你視為理所當然、完全不會費心多想的。這向我們顯示了，社會的價值場域之於你，就像是水之於魚；你悠遊其中，卻鮮少察覺它的存在。\n\n社會的價值場域，是由無數烙印在你我意識裡的價值階級所交織而成（包含了文化傳統、科技催化、演化心理等因素）。它讓你每一天醒來都能輕鬆地踏進一個已知的世界，不必因為世界的複雜多變而感到焦慮無助，更使你能夠輕鬆地信任生活中無以計數的人事物——每一天，你知道陌生人會和你保持距離、你知道如何和同事或家人相處、你知道該期待在餐廳得到怎樣的服務、你知道公眾事務會一如往常地正確運作。在每一個或小或大的群體中，人們都受到某個共同的目標所指引、朝著某個共同的方向前進、實踐著某一套共享的價值階級。\n\n無論是家庭、公司、乃至整個國家，如果沒有廣受接納的信仰系統、沒有對群體目標的普遍共識、沒有至少一種多數人同意的價值階級，就不可能建立秩序、不可能有效分工並解決問題、不可能產生能夠指引人們去為自己和周遭他人創造更多安康的「生命藍圖」——一個社會所共享的價值和敘事，是無數前人歷經長時間的磨合、省思、與洗鍊後所得到的，關於人生的系統性解答。\n\n大自然如此殘酷無情、生命如此乖舛無常，如果我們以為人類可以拋開沉重的階級秩序、像童話故事裡的森林小動物般自由獨立、無憂無慮地生活，那實是對世界、對歷史、對人性都太過無知了。\n\n確實，社會奉行的秩序也可能替暴君背書、長久傳承的價值也可能迫害個人，但那既非任何社會秩序的初衷、更不是其運作健全的成果。我們舉目所見的社會價值和階級秩序，遠遠不是用來限制、壓迫個人自由的無謂枷鎖，而是人類在倉皇紊亂的世界裡，企圖為彼此的生命找到安定與意義的渺小努力。\n\n因此，在我們對各種形式的社會秩序提出批判之前，我們應當認清的事實是：無論宗教、傳統、倫理、或文化，這些價值階級所做的事情並非只是（許多人控訴的）將你形塑成適合嵌入社會整體裡的形狀，有甚於此，它們事先替你把整個社群形塑成了一個穩定互信、有跡可尋、使你能安心容身的地方。\n\n我們應當體認到自己每一天都如何受惠於人類社會歷經長遠歲月所積累的秩序，並以審慎積極的態度參與這個已為我們拓寬道路的世界。\n\n\n\n---\n\n註：\n\n1.

Despite the short term investing being a rough zero sum game, there’s still no real winning and losing behind each decision. One’s earnings could be a loss in certain perspective, one’s losing could be a win in another perspective. You simply don’t know why one buys or sells, so it’s impossible to determine the win and loss for others. Thus it’s impossible to answer the question whether an earnings is moral or not.\n\nAdding the company’s earnings and works into the equation, 2 people can invest at the same time and earn the same amount, while one spent lots of time researching but the other was simply following others blindly. You can argue maybe one person deserves the earnings more than the other, but essentially it’s impossible to determine the answer.\n\nThis is to hold each person accountable for his/her decision in the market. One is responsible for his decision in his investing and no one is capable of judging his economical behavior other than himself. Essentially the only win or loss is determined by the person.\n\nSame is applied in politics. We hold each person accountable for his decision in voting and everyone has the same vote, despite the difference in how they’re informed and educated and how much they’ve researched. We gave up the position to judge others decisions on any given topic only so we can make sure the capable people can have their voices heard, and in turn things can be bettered in turn of that. The individual freedom and free market creates this frame where one can affect the world in a positive way with maximum space and flexibility. This is the pillar of modern society.\n\nEssentially we need to accept that there’s no one answer for everyone if we want to enjoy the fruit of such belief manifesting in our society. We have to accept the fact that everyone can have the freedom to pursue their own answer and truth in their own way without anyone interfering. And the faith in that, in turn of everyone pursuing their own truth (instead of any supervisor assigning the tasks to them), we can make the society thrive.\n\nSo it’s not a proper way to view this world anymore in that we think there’s already an answer for everyone (totalatism, traditional religions, right wind conservatives don’t gel with this world view very well), or thinking one group of people have the answer for all (Marxism, post modernist, left wing). Instead we have to understand that people should be viewed as sovereign individuals so we can exploit the talent in people. However it’s also not proper to view the world that everyone can have this own answer and everything is relative, as nilhism is not helpful for the society to gain consensus and move toward an united direction.\n\n獨裁政權 vs 虛無主義\n  \n\nEchoed by Peter

\nlinks: [[神聖個人]]、[[道德]]、[[倫理學]]、[[政治]]、[[社會]]、[[價值]]、[[潛能]]\nref:\n[[個人德性的意義與責任]]\n\n---\n「神聖個人」的意思是，**人類世界裡最重要的單位是個人。個人之所以神聖，不是來自他身上既有的被動特質、未經檢驗的慾望索求、或隨波逐流的粗心言行，而是因為他擁有身而為人的重要潛能：行使理性、瞭解自我、敬天愛人、彰顯良善、生產創造、追求卓越。**\n\n每一個人都有獨一無二的經歷與可能性，但你我皆因具備這些潛能而神聖、應當受到社會群體的尊敬與重視、並且值得我們富有責任感地善待和灌溉自己——這需要我們拿出主動性、理性、道德、責任感、以及創造力去實現。\n\n所以，任何將個人尊嚴和主動性「降格」、草率地把自己或他人化約成沒有自主意識的標籤化單位的傾向，諸如受害者情結、群眾心理、道德勒索、威權主義、非黑即白的二元善惡觀等，我們都必須保持警覺，因為這些心理陷阱不僅會出現在他人身上，更可能自你我內心浮現。\n\n無論今天要進行關於法治、經濟、道德、正義、公平的討論，都該優先從「**擁有自由意志、能夠主動作為、富有創造力與影響力的個人**」出發。種族、宗教、性向、資產階級等其他社會單元和分類縱然有其論述的用途，但均不該凌駕個人的神聖重要性。唯有當我們戒慎但堅定地捍衛「神聖個人」的立場，才能避免重複落入歷史上無以計數的善惡對立、部落主義、威權統治、身份政治等泯滅個人以致釀成巨災的意識形態陷阱。\n\n「神聖個人」絕非淺碟的個人主義、粗暴地把個人願望昇華到一切之上，它更該富有道德、責任感、以及深刻的社群關懷，是超越了利己和利他、且能滲透到其他公眾議題討論的一種德性倫理學觀點。「神聖個人」是法律之前人人平等、無罪推定等重要法治原則的前提；是我們拒絕任何形式的物化、工具化他人的理據；是賦予政府有限權力、實踐民主政治的基石；更應該是社會中的每一個人對待彼此的根本信念。\n\n---\n\n我相信，東西方文明都指出了「神聖個人」的重要性，這絕非巧合，因為這是根本上正確的看待每個人的方式。為什麼呢？\n\n在我看來，我們只可能有三種看待每個人類個體的方式：\n\n\n## 第一，是相信個人毫無神聖性。\n\n這個觀點廣為流傳於受當代物質主義、新無神論、及虛無主義影響的知識份子及年輕世代。他們相信不存在著任何「神授」的人類價值、人類生命僅是宇宙中的意外事件、人生在根本上並無意義。奠基於這些「事實」，他們在價值上往往會朝類似道德相對論的立場靠攏，但不是因為他們覺得道德相對論真的很有道理，而是他們對於要在這個自由開放的時代裡採取篤定的道德立場感到很沒有安全感。更何況，優先亮出「支持自由多元開放進步」的「友善」牌照，不但能讓你避免被進步主義道德警察給獵巫，還可以獲得免費的道德點數。\n\n現代人雖然經常不樂意透過宗教或傳統的觀點去承認個人神聖性，但他們幾乎不可能不經由其他途徑去為自己的生命加諸意義、注入某種「絕對」的價值，所以很多人才會秉持著像是「問心無愧地活著」、「追求熱情」、「創造自己的人生意義」的信條在生活，或是為了安頓內心「意義真空」的焦慮、努力說服自己「我已經夠好了」。 \n\n換句話說，幾乎所有看似不相信個人神聖性的人，其實都用預設了個人神聖性的方式活著、努力將自己視為一個重要且積極的存在，他們只不過是特別排斥太文言或傳統的措辭罷了。但也因為缺乏對個人神聖性的深刻思索，他們難免會偶爾忘了這件事，進而疏於照顧和鞭策自己。\n\n至於真正相信個人毫無神聖性的人，[他們對此信念的實踐值得我們恐懼](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E7%BA%A6%E5%87%AF%E6%8B%89%E6%A0%A1%E5%9B%AD%E6%9E%AA%E5%87%BB%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6)，而那已經不是我們可以輕易拆解的問題。\n\n\n## 第二，是相信只有部分個人是神聖的。\n\n任何將世界看作為「善與惡的戰場」、並相信自己是「正義的一方」的人，都難以避免在某些時候選擇性遺忘了他人的神聖性，或根本直接全盤否定任何他們認定為「邪惡」的對象。一旦他們相信一個對象夠邪惡，一切是非對錯就可能被昇華到部落主義的聖戰層級，他們會拒絕任何形式的對話、甚至相信暴力是可以被合理化的。如果有關心過去五年的國內外新聞，上述現象可以輕易地在政治光譜的兩端看到不可勝數的例子。我們亦可由二戰以降的各種偶像崇拜、極權專制、對敵人的妖魔化宣傳所窺見。（推薦閱讀：《[好人總是自以為是](https://search.books.com.tw/redirect/move/key/Jonathan+Haidt/area/mid/item/0010669638/page/1/idx/4/cat/001/pdf/1/spell/3)》、《[為什麼我們製造出玻璃心世代?](https://search.books.com.tw/redirect/move/key/Jonathan+Haidt/area/mid/item/0010850061/page/1/idx/2/cat/001/pdf/1/spell/3)》）\n\n當你順從群眾、自命正義、將對立面視為寇讎，你不只抹滅了對方的人性，你其實也拋棄了自己作為神聖個人的「獨立思考」的主控權。換句話說，你可能正扮演著意識形態的棋子，受到操弄而毫不自知。\n\n你錯我對、敵惡我善的部落主義心態是如此易於流傳又難以抵抗，我們更有責任要善於自省、嚴己寬人、慎防群眾心理和意識形態的激情。已經有太多太多的歷史證據向我們顯示，任何以簡單善惡劃分敵我的二元觀點，都存在著走向極權專制、將公眾議題道德化、將異己去人性化、將暴力合理化的危險。\n\n大人世界裡的政治紛擾和是非爭端的解方，終究回到我們從小就耳熟能詳、長大卻拋諸腦後的基本道理：孔子說要反省自身、積極修為，君子根本無暇評斷他人；耶穌則訓誡我們要去掉自己眼中的樑木、不要論斷人，有資格審判人的只有上帝。無論你是否相信上帝，都不應該自認有資格勝任審判世人的工作、不應該過度自滿於你想為人類創造的烏托邦、不應該將所有與你相左的意見視為邪惡——這應是身而一個遠非完美的人類所該秉持的最基本的謙卑。\n\n至於另一種詮釋「只有部分個人是神聖的」的方式，是把自己歸類在毫無神聖性的那一邊。據我所知這只會有兩種可能性，一種是憂鬱症，另一種是極權社會主義國家。我應該不用說明為什麼兩者都不是好選項。\n\n\n## 第三，是相信每個個人皆是神聖的。\n\n我們每個人都想要被這世界視為一個擁有自由意志、能夠主動作為、富有創造力與影響力的積極存在。正因為我們都有創造的潛能、追求意義的需求、獨立自主的意志（或至少想要如此相信），所以當我們被視為沒有能力決定任何事情、沒有能力使自己和周遭他人變得更好、沒有能力為自己或他人創造價值的消極存在時，活著就變成了徹底空洞的消磨，甚至使人產生毀滅性的慾望。\n\n當你讓年幼的孩子在晚飯前幫忙擺放碗盤、並稱讚他做得很好，你便是肯定他「為世界帶來價值」的潛能，而沒有一個孩子會不喜歡這種「發現自己有能力將良善（Good）帶進世界」的感覺——這是讓我們最深刻地感覺到「我存在」的時刻之一。相對地，當你看著正值年少的兒女在那裡自怨自艾、覺得自己糟糕憂愁又不被愛時，你或多或少會因為他們對自己身上背負的潛能、創造力、及責任的徹底漠視感到生氣，因為你清楚地知道他們「不僅僅是如此」。\n\n同孩子一樣，我們也都在工作、感情、家庭等不同型態的群我關係中追尋著那份認可自我的意義，都想透過自身意志去施予和收受、去體驗「當人生舞台的主角」的那種踏實存在感。這是為什麼青少年討厭大人為他們做決定、把他們當成沒有能力思考的次等公民，也是為什麼家中長輩總在不被重視或越加虛弱的時候，試圖證明自己還可以為家裡貢獻點什麼、證明這個家仍然是需要他的。\n\n每個人都想要被視為有價值、有主動性的神聖個人，無論我們心裡是否清楚這點。一旦我們能夠深刻體認個人的神聖性，我們會更明白該如何引導自己的生命，並且有尊嚴地、盡力地善待自己和他人。\n\n---\n\n「神聖個人」強調的並不是每個人應享有的權利，而是指出每一個人都是足以挪動這世界、決定它傾往天堂或地獄的重要主體——個人的權利與幸福則會是承擔這個責任後的附帶品。個人神聖性的實踐，意味著毫無保留地發展一個人的理性、創造力、與道德力量，因此每一個人及其潛能都是不可忽視且舉足輕重的。\n\n值得澄清的是，「神聖個人」並不是天真的性善論。縱然我們瞭解每個人都有向善的潛能，也必須明白人性要投入邪惡並不困難。\n\n善與惡是一體的兩面，我們可以透過對惡的認識來推論善，也可以經由對善的理解去遠離惡。從惡的角度出發，可以參考Jordan Peterson對亞當夏娃偷嘗禁果的理解：人類意識到自己赤身裸體的脆弱，並發現其他人也具有相同的脆弱後，便能夠推導出「我可以用自己會被傷害的方式去傷害他人」的結論。從善的角度出發，可以參考孟子對人性向善的詮釋：他以「孺子入井」的故事，點出了我們不忍別人無故受苦的「惻隱之心」，相信人類具有無條件地關懷別人的道德能力和傾向。就科學的角度，鏡像神經元的發現則證實了上述的兩種理解。\n\n人性向善，但為惡亦在咫尺。從儒學、斯多葛主義，到善於書寫權力法則的[Robert Greene](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010868819?sloc=main)，都一在提醒我們克己復禮、善待他人的同時，切勿無知天真地縱容和輕信他人，而要保有明亮眼光與深刻智慧去判斷形勢、洞悉他人、明哲保身。若缺乏智慧又寧願保持無知，你便是任由自己流於被剝削利用的命運，而這顯然嚴重傷害了你的個人神聖性。\n\n因此，你有責任打理好自己的生活和身心，將自己視為值得被幫助的對象，盡可能不再為世界創造不必要的苦難。當你照顧好自己，你才會進一步有能力為自己和你所愛之人帶來幸福和慰藉。又即使在你沒有能力改變現狀、承受著無可避免的苦難時，你也最低限度能決定自己要用什麼姿態受苦。\n\n請記住，你為自己和周遭他人所帶來的任何一點安康，都絕非微不足道；你為減輕世上苦難所付出的任何一分努力，都絕非徒勞無功——我們身上都背負著這份不容忽視的潛能，以及實現這份潛能的責任。\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E6%98%AF%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%9E%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2%E7%9A%84%E7%84%A1%E5%BD%A2%E5%8A%9B%E9%87%8F":{"title":"科技是形塑人類歷史的無形力量","content":"#📝️/🌿

空有觀念而無系統\n\n用同一個類比反過來想：如果徒有好的地勢、卻無相對的溝渠能夠配合，雖然水能夠大致往一個正確的方向流，但就很難集中眾志、引導社會往同一個方向前進。換句話說，沒有好的系統、或甚至只有壞的（善行不被鼓勵、惡行受到獎賞）的系統，那麼一個有良好公德的社會或許頂多能夠撐得比其他人民普遍較自私的社會久一點，或者也可能能聰明地發明或融入能鼓勵獎賞好行為的社會機制來改良、平衡原本的機制（就像是日本和德國在資本主義下的職場文化和法制環境促成了對員工和職人的尊敬和照顧）。\n\n然而我們也不應該一切都寄望在道德教育上，因為一個難以直指的事實是，在設計一個讓人們參與的系統時，其往往就帶有某些或被彰顯、或未點明的道德前提和假設。當一個系統的規則本身鼓勵著特定的行為或特質、獎勵著特定的結果和作為、忽略甚至懲罰特定的行為或特質，那麼這很顯然就是一種帶有道德意含的律則，我們很難要求參加者能總是主動自己帶入某些沒有被遊戲規則所點名或獎賞的德性，甚至那些德性更有可能是讓參加者在遊戲中無法拔得頭籌的障礙。\n\n群體的觀念能夠反過來改良優化原本的系統、讓它運作得更順暢和長久，系統的遊戲規則本身也經常帶有一套道德的前提或假設、任何認真想參與的人都可能放大那套道德前提、甚至屏棄那些對於贏得遊戲沒有幫助（但可能是好的）的觀念。很顯然，我們需要兩者的配合、相輔相成，才能夠引領社會走向更美好共榮的境地，或至少避免公眾德性的腐敗和系統運作的崩壞。\n\n---\n\n在人類老祖先生活的史前時代，高熱量、高糖份的食物十分罕見，有機會遇到就該吃越多越好、將難能可貴的熱量儲存起來備用。時至今日，現代人因為熱量太容易取得、相同的演化習性卻沒有跟上時代，而得擔心肥胖、糖尿病等問題。\n\n演化上的眾多證據說明了人類的動物性往往是自利、短視、甚至暴力的，所以該令人詫異的是，人類為何也能成為理性、無私、和平且遠慮的動物？會是什麼，讓人類蛻變成有道德的自主個人、秉持犧牲的信念去思考和行為，進以建立文明、提升群體福祉？\n\n答案是科技。\n\n如果我們能夠理解，對於第一個發現尖銳樹枝可以作為狩獵工具的人類而言，那支樹枝就是「科技」，我們便可以取得一個簡單清楚的定義：**科技，就是人類在自身感官之外、有目的性地跟世界互動的方式。**\n\n科技與人類的攜手演進有交互的作用；我們雖是科技的發明者，但科技也反過來改變了人類與世界互動、進而看待世界和人類自己的方式。舉例來說，犁的發明大大提升農耕效率的同時，也因為圈養和鞭笞家畜的需要，削弱了狩獵採集時代的人類對其他動物之靈性的正視、開始了以人類為中心的宗教/世界觀。另一方面，農耕效率的提升讓聚落可以養活的人數增加，人數增加等同對外侵犯力的增加，使得其他聚落不得不採行這項科技以確保抵禦外敵的能力。農業聚落的人口增加，讓人類大規模合作的需求出現，成為國家的基礎、導致軍事的中心化/專業化、形成農業時代下各地興起的封建制度。\n\n\n**如果我們同意道德問題有好答案和壞答案的區別、也同意好答案必須最大程度地關心群體的跨期福祉，那麼我們就不可能否認，科技對於道德的促進或減損往往有明確的傾向；我們不可能忽視科技背後的道德意涵及責任。**\n\n由摩爾定律驅動的當代指數型科技，其成長之快速迫使我們正視各項科技背後的「前提」。一旦前提設定偏頗，我們就會看到自由市場的競逐將如何以最有效率的方式、最大化錯誤的指標——最顯著的實例莫過於社群媒體：為求互動率、吸住人們的目光，社群媒體一個個成為政治謠言、激化對立、同溫層、上癮行為的溫床。可參考紀錄片《The Social Dilemma》。\n\n\n\n\n若檢視科技演進的歷程，我們會發現科技在很多時候遠非特定發明家或企業家的自主意識產物，而更像是在特定時空背景下必然會發生的事件——就算沒有愛迪生，燈泡也遲早（已經）被其他同時代的人發明；就算沒有祖克柏，也肯定會有其他類似臉書的產品在社群媒體當道的時代裡被做出來。\n\n科技像是個潛伏於人類集體意識底層、一個有自主意識的神秘聲音，會在對的時間、在對的人（或人們）耳邊低語某個關鍵的靈感，企圖引領我們朝某個不得而知的方向前進。如果對於這點不能理解，我會推薦Kevin Kelly的《[科技想要什麼](https://www.thenewslens.com/article/144474/fullpage)》：\n\n\u003e歷史上大多數的時刻，大多數人看到豐饒文明中累積起來的可能性才會讓他們變得更好。這就是為什麼我們創造出文明／科技。這就是為什麼我們有工具。科技和工具帶給我們選擇，包括變好的選擇。\n\u003e\n\u003e如果我們無法放大其他人的機會，就會縮減他們的機會，這是不可原諒的缺失。因此，為其他人擴展創造力的規模，是我們的責任。我們擴展科技體的機會，發展出更多科技，用更多共榮同樂的方法表現科技，就能擴展其他人。\n\n但科技可不只是「發明」而已。從更深更廣的文明角度來看，**科技更是形塑人類歷史的、無形但真正關鍵的力量**：\n\n- 農業革命，使人類脫離定期遷徙、與自然共處的生活，產生累積財富、保障安全的需求，進而發展私有財產、法制、武士階級（武力的中心化）、專業分工等觀念——最後毫不巧合地在同一時期的世界各地形成了封建制度。\n- 槍械的發明，讓原需數千數萬個小時精實訓練的武士階級，被受過簡單槍械使用訓練的士兵所取代。武力不再被特定階級所獨占，轉而取決於哪個國家可以花比較多錢、將夠多槍械放進懂得開槍的兵士手中——中心化的國家政府成為比封建制度更合理的解答。\n- 印刷術的出現，更是直接或間接導致了宗教革命（將原是奢侈品的聖經抄寫本交到了大眾的手中）、文藝復興、知識和資訊的傳播和累積——於是科學得以蓬勃發展；新聞業（始於報紙）則強化了國民的自主意識，民主制度的接著出現也就無須絲毫意外。\n- 同理，我們也可以推論出工業革命如何催生了市場經濟（且與民主體制難分難捨）、避孕工具如何催生了性別革命。縱使是那些企圖把自己排除在西方思潮外的國家（如中國），也都不得不在迎接硬體科技革新的同時，一定程度地轉變其社會上運行的作業系統——拒絕擁抱更強大的科技，等於置自己國民的安康、和國家的競爭力於不顧。（就連樂意讓人民生活於水生火熱之中的北韓，都知道要嚷著核武才可能讓自己留在談判桌上。）\n\n換句話說，我們經常以為歷史事件的主使者是那些大名鼎鼎、與眾不同的標誌人物，但更多時候，他們只是科技力量的代理人——就算我們回到過去消滅馬克思及其同夥、抹除所有共產主義的相關資訊，在當時資本社會的熱烈發展下，產生出另一種神似共產主義的思想大概只是時間的問題。同樣地，女性主義在特定時空背景及科技驅使下遲早是要出現的，就看我們將其歸功於誰；中國就算沒有鄧小平，也大概會有其他人在那個時間點跳出來主張類似改革開放的政策。\n\n說到這裡，可能讓讀者摸不著頭緒了：所以這是在說，人類只是科技力量的傀儡？歷史上特定個人行善或為惡的作為大可被忽略？個人生在任一時空背景下都是毫無主動性的？那麼前面扯了這麼多我們該對群體跨期福祉的關心及努力，又有何意義？\n\n\nStepping stones\n- 就算燈泡必然會被發明，共產、資本、女性主義總會用某種方式誕生在世界上，也不代表我們沒有愛因斯坦也一樣能製造出核子武器、沒有甘迺迪也一樣能平安度過古巴危機。有些事件是洪流中必將出現、特定人物只是劇中角色的必然，有其他事件是歷史上幾無可能用其他方式重現的關鍵轉捩。\n- 就因為我們不總是歷史上具備主動性的創造者，不代表人類只是科技力量的傀儡、我們的道德主動性在歷史洪流的宿命論下微不足道。相反地，正因為科技力量及其伴隨而來的許多多極陷阱是如此難以跨越，我們更加需要有意識的個人為群體的跨期福祉有所努力，這種努力許多時候並不是參與既有的遊戲、企圖從遊戲中創造改變，而更可能是破壞性、顛覆性的作為，甚至利用某種仍在萌芽階段的新科技去顛覆既有體制中已經無法回頭的趨勢。對，科技力量勢不可擋，也因此每一個個人如何操使這份一步步逼近上帝的強大科技力，現在遠比歷史上的其他時刻都來得更加關鍵。\n- 我們並不是科技力量的傀儡，但我們也不該天真地以為科技只是我們的工具。人類與科技是個共同且「交互」進化的關係；科技賦予我們越加龐大的力量、及這份力量帶給我們的挑戰，某種程度上幾乎可說是上帝對人類智慧的考驗。這個故事從夏娃偷嘗禁果的那一刻便上演到今天——在歷史的某一刻，人類發現能有效獵殺動物的武器也可以用來殺傷自己的仇敵，而今天我們對核子武器的擔憂則是相同的問題、但升級到了全球浩劫的等級。\n- 所以我們藉以「校準」自身行動的是非善惡，決定了我們與科技的關係——如果被缺乏智慧與遠見的動物性所驅使，我們就即有可能淪為科技力量的傀儡，讓人類成為名為「科技」的神祇在世界上恣意妄為的手段；如果我們能懷抱智慧與遠見、用理性和信念去操使科技力量，我們便有機會用超越科技發明的「硬體」所定義的方式，去運行社會群體的內心底層的「軟體」，扭轉逐底競爭的必輸賽局。（像是日本以其獨有的文化去操使現代科技和自由經濟資本主義，他們在文化的根本層面上、「自主地」刻意節制自身對當前/短期利益的追求，有意識地建立由信任、遠見、永續、精益求精等「美德」所驅使的一套獨有的資本主義自由經濟，並在全球經濟中獨樹一幟，難以被取代。）\n- 對，我們沒辦法基於對人類美德的信念而放棄核武、因為世界上總可能有國家會偷留一手對付他人，所以很遺憾我們不可能不將某部份的國家預算用在軍事上，但這不代表我們就一定要跟所有人廝殺到底、血流成河。\n- 道德——即我們用來回應「應然」問題的作業系統——在這個時間點、且是人類前所未有地受制於自由市場經濟的多極陷阱中的時刻，才會尤其的複雜難解、又如此重要，而需要每一個個人認知到自己肩上的道德重任。\n\n---\nlinks: [[科技]]、[[道德]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[Meditations on Moloch]]\n[[We

科技革新往往是漸進的。大眾通常只記得、也只為那些看似天外飛來的創新驚呼，但他們只是沒有關注相關領域的發展、不曉得看似巨大的創新實是來自無數在那之前的微小演變與改良。\n2. 承1，人們對通常只記得、也對歷史上突出的發明家過譽了，因為創新通常不是發生在某個產品被發明或「行得通」的那一刻，而是某個產品被成功地降低成本、提高生產、並大量地送到消費者手中的那一刻（NASA將太空人送上月球縱然很了不起，但真正對人類歷史更大的影響得等到普羅大眾能夠支付太空旅行的那一天）。\n3. 承1，科技革新來自微小的演變和改良，更仰賴企業家和技術人士的「觸類旁通」、抓住一閃而逝的微小契機並傾注資源將之化為現實——Yahoo和Google的創辦人一開始的目標都不是要創造「搜尋引擎」、Twitter的創辦人一開始則是想發明讓人們找到Podcast的方式。創新往往是意外發現的產物。\n4. 承1，科技革新更多是用正確的、市場能夠欣賞的方式「重組」了某些已經存在的功能、服務、或產品——發明汽車的人並不需要也發明輪子、彈簧、和鋼鐵。只要在夠多人口、市場夠熱絡的地方，我們就能發現這些創新。\n5. 科技革新需要反覆試驗及除錯。大多數的企業家都不會成功，因為大多數的創新都不會一推出就成功、一被發明就運作無虞、毫無瑕疵。\n6. 科技革新是團隊運動。大眾心目中的天才發明家、不世出的科技奇才等英雄主義想像，通常都是不足的。承上，一個發明家或許能讓某個東西「行得通」，但要將這個產品送到大眾的手上，需要遠遠更多人的才智和專業。\n7. 科技是勢不可擋的。\n   1922年，哥倫比亞大學在同一時間紀錄到148件由不同人們提出、但幾乎一模一樣的發明，這顯示了科技的革新是歷史上的某種必然。不同人在同一時間發明出同一個產品，比較像是常態而非偶然。科技產物幾乎像是特定背景下結出的、即將成熟落地的果實；我們可以說搜尋引擎幾乎不可能不在1990年代被發明，燈泡幾乎不可能不在1870年代被發明。\n   有趣的是，這幾乎離奇地點出了人類在科技演進中的無足輕重，該出現的東西就是會出現，或許會晚一點、或許會換個名字或樣式，但它們終究會被發明。\n   當我們回顧過去，我們會覺得特定的科技創新是再理所當然不過的事；當我們展望未來，我們卻壓根不可能做出任何不會貽笑大方的預測。\n   [[We Wrestle Not With Flesh and Blood, but Against Powers and Principalities]]\n8. Amara's Law指出：人們通常高估了一項新科技在短期的影響，而低估了它在長期的影響（關於個人發展，人們也經常有同樣的高估短期、低估長期的傾向）。我們因此應該企圖思考一項新科技可能會有的[[二階效用(2nd order effect)]]甚至更多，尤其在設計一個新的、有潛力影響許多人的科技產物時。\n9. 科技革新偏愛去中心化治理。帝國通常不太善於創新；裡頭那些富裕有學識的菁英通常更樂於捍衛既得利益、抗拒新事物、將資源投注於奢侈品、戰爭、貪污，而非事業。近一千年來，科技革新不成比例地大量發生於城市中、尤其是那些自治的地區。\n---\n10. 科技革新讓我們能使用更少的資源。我們現在能使用更少的水產出更多的食物，更少的燃料航行更長的里程，更少的電力撥通更遠的通訊，更少的鋼鐵建造更多的建築……2008年以後的十年裡，美國每年以15%的程度成長、能源消耗卻以每年2%的速度下降，這就是因為科技的革新。科技革新使我們能用更少的資源提升更多人的生活品質，成長可以是永續的。\n    Comment: \n    This one essentially contradicts Jevons paradox.

Kirk）\n\n如果有個人說要跟你玩一個叫做「你想要怎樣都可以」的遊戲，你肯定會非常困惑、搞不懂這個遊戲的意義在哪——當一個遊戲不具有任何的疆界和規則時，那就根本沒有遊戲可玩。\n\n同理，人與人的合理互動——加總起來，就是社會整體的運作——必是建立在最根本的、被人們共同遵守、相互制約的律則之上。而我相信所有人都會同意，在最理想的情況下，這套律則應該是大家都有共識、而且樂意主動投入的。\n\n---\n# 秩序必然先於正義和自由\n\n首先，讓我們看看作家余杰[對於秩序的論述](https://rightpoint.site/column-yujie-kirk-210909/)：\n\n\u003e**「秩序」一詞意味著一種系統的和諧機制——不管是指向個人品格還是共同體。而且「秩序」的內涵也包括在共同體中履行特定的義務和享有特定的權利，因此才有了「公民社會秩序」的說法。** \n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e在被譽為「美國保守主義之父」的政治哲學家拉塞爾．柯克看來，比民主和自由更重要的、美國的第一關鍵詞乃是「秩序」。他認為，**秩序是靈魂的第一需要。除非我們認可某些約束自身的秩序原則，否則便不可能愛我們當愛之物。秩序是共同體的第一需要。除非我們認可借以實現正義的某些秩序原則，否則便不可能與他人和諧相處。** 靈魂的「內在秩序」和社會的「外在秩序」是緊密相連的，柯克警告說：「**如果美國人缺乏很好的個人道德秩序，法治便不可能在美國佔主導地位。如果缺乏有序的政治模式，美國人的個人品德便會墮落到毀滅性的自我中心之中**」。\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e人類社會最可怕的狀態不是極權主義而是無政府狀態。柯克談及一位從俄羅斯流亡到美國的學者向他講述的布爾什維克革命，那位流亡者通過那些恐怖事件逐步認識到**秩序必然先於正義和自由**。布爾什維克奪權後，此人逃到黑海邊上的敖德薩。當時，這座城市正處於無政府狀態。由年輕人組成的匪幫挾持了室內有軌電車，在市中心肆無忌憚地向行人開槍，就像獵殺鴿子一樣。居民的公寓隨時會被某一罪犯或瘋子入侵，他們僅僅為了一片麵包而殺人。在這種無政府狀態中，正義與自由只是美麗的詞彙。他痛定思痛地說：「我當時得到的教訓是，在我們享有正義和自由之前，我們必須要有秩序。我儘管非常痛恨獨裁者，那時卻認為極權政治再可怕，也比無序好。很多人可能會在極權制度中活下來，卻無人能在普遍的無序中倖存」。\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e柯克還說：「一旦基督教信仰為某個民族普遍接受，那麼，任何政治安排都會受到基督教有關道德秩序的教義的影響。這一道德秩序會作用於政治秩序。基督教有關正義、仁愛、共同體和義務的觀念可能會在不急速改變政府架構的情況下轉化一個社會。個人的價值、上帝面前人人平等的觀念，以及對所有世俗權威的限制——這些都將塑造美利堅共和國的基督教信念」。\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e歷史學家波特霍夫所說：「美國社會史有力地說明，**如果人們顛覆或拋棄內含於設計得很好的制度結構中的價值觀，並因此拆毀文化成就與精神平和的社會根基，他們將將自己置於極大的危險之中**」。\n\n從更常識性的角度看，秩序之所以先於正義和自由，是因為我們數萬年來身處其中的自然世界，對人類的渺小生命實是非常殘酷暴虐的。要消滅一大批人類，只消用上一點氣候驟變或猛獸侵襲即可。無怪乎各大宗教都在在告誡我們，生命的本質是苦、世事總是無常。\n\n顯見，秩序是人類建立文明、改善生活、確保安康的必要途徑，它引領了大部分人的生命、保全了社會的完整與安穩。我們不可能否認秩序帶來了你我今天生活的這個世界。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%AB%8B%E5%BF%97%E6%96%BC%E4%BD%A0%E8%83%BD%E8%A8%AD%E6%83%B3%E7%9A%84%E6%9C%80%E5%B4%87%E9%AB%98%E7%9B%AE%E6%A8%99":{"title":"","content":"tags:

to)」，並依內心的答案去行動。\n\n設定最崇高的目標，能幫助我們長期保持方向的正確，避免失焦於眼前的成果、利益、或困境。將目標設定得夠高、並納入關於自己及他人的思考，我們才能夠在日常的每一個行動中確認自己是否真的為長遠、為自己、為群體著想，而不是執著於當前的好處或考驗，而做出可能會在長期下傷害我們、或傷害其他我們所在乎的人事物的決定。**設想最崇高目標，我們才可能在個人、家庭、職場、社會等各個層次裡都盡可能達成一致方向、避免目標衝突所導致的失衡和失落。**\n\n在工作上，要釐清一個目標是否夠「好」，我們只需衡量它是否符合KPI、迎合老闆的喜好、能替公司帶來效益，但如果我們思考自己在職場上的最「崇高」目標，這會無可避免地帶入他人、以及你和他人之間的關係，那會是你的同事、下屬、或客戶。這個道德上的思辨將迫使我們跨越「獨善其身」的範疇、踏進「相善其群」的領域，而這個「群」更有可能遠遠超過你所處的辦公室或甚至公司本身。這個思考也幫助我們釐清自身工作的真正使命、讓我們看見自己日復一日的勞動之於這個世界究竟有何意義。\n\n作為一位基層人員，你的工作之於身邊他人、公司、客戶乃至這個世界的真正意義是什麼？作為一名主管，你是否能為公司、為上司、乃至為你的下屬創造更多的、勝過每月營業獎金的價值？作為一個企業主，你能為公司的每一位同仁、以及社會大眾帶來什麼比你的商品或服務還要更可貴的東西？許多時候，這些問題的答案並不會圍繞著你所能給予他人的好處或方便，而是關於你如何看待與對待他人、你自己、還有你與他人之間的關係。\n\n離開職場、走入家庭與社會，這樣的思考更貼近我們的生活，也因此更加必要：你希冀的家庭是什麼樣子？你想像自己在那個家庭中的狀態為何？你期待家庭成員們用怎樣的方式共處？你希望你的兒女長成怎樣的人？你希望人們如何看待你與你的家庭？你所設想的家庭能否共體人生的苦與樂，無論安康或顛沛都能相互扶持？然後，在這些想像底下，你是否清楚自己必須成為怎樣的人，才有機會使這一切化為現實？\n\n於是，在職涯、家庭的目標之上，我們勢必得再更深一層、釐清自己對生命本身的想法：你重視什麼價值？你最在乎的事物是什麼？你希望在他人心目中留下什麼評價？你期許自己過著怎樣的生活？你有什麼未能伸展的志向或待完成的夢想？最令你感受到生命意義的是什麼？這些問題的答案又如何引領你為自己訂下職涯、家庭、以及其他生活面向上的目標？\n\n在這裡，每一層的思考、每一層的目標訂定都毫不容易，需要我們誠實地探索自己的經驗與內心才可能抽絲剝繭。關於生命的思索絕非形而上的賣弄玄虛，我們看待人生的方式總會以非常實際的方式顯露於一言一行當中、深入生活的每一個角落。**抗拒思考並不是個替代方案，因為當你的內心缺乏洞見、觀點模糊，你的行動就會欠缺明確動機、難以直指目標，那就像矇著眼睛丟出飛鏢，丟不丟中什麼都是任由命運宰制。** 更別說生命如此複雜，每一個面向都存在著許多值得追求的目標、以及需要避免的困境，若未釐清真正引領你前進的價值及其排序，我們便很可能某一天驚覺自己在家庭、事業、個人身心等面向上都充滿對立和相互衝突的需求，而屆時已難以平衡。\n\n當然，訂定目標不是萬靈丹，它既不會替我們排除生命中的任何問題、也可能不會照著我們規劃的藍圖前進，而這也是為什麼我們需要探問這些更高層次、更困難的人生問題。建立在現實條件上的目標總有可能失落、意外總有可能發生、時間越長就只會有越多不確定性；但建立在價值之上的目標和洞見則相反，它們會在你墜落時撐起你、在你得意時警醒你，並隨著時間越長、你越瞭解自己後，帶給你日益澄澈的眼光。","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E7%BD%AA%E8%AB%96":{"title":"","content":"tags:

齊克果\n\n罪並非是道德議題，Anti-Climacus指出，一個認識神的人，或是有神的觀念的人，如果他絕望於不願做他自己或是絕望於要做他自己，這二者的表現都是罪。\n\n當人認識到他的自我是直接立於神面前的自我之時，就不再是從人的標準來衡量自我，而是，這個自我將具有新的質，並且也要繼續從新的方面來發展這個自我。當人認識這個新的自我的可能性，卻對這個自我絕望，不願成為這個該有的自我之時，齊克果稱之為罪，那正是在神面前的「不信」。「罪」在此前提之下其同義詞就是「不信」，或者說其反義詞就是「信」。這也是基督教信仰本質的根本。因此，從齊克果的觀點，惟獨人立於神面前才可能知罪，基督教的罪觀當從此論起。\n\n人的過錯之所以稱為罪， 是因為人在神面前而顯出其犯罪意識。這意識是不願讓神的旨意成為他自己的意願，也就是不願意順服神之意。而所論的這意識，並非指存心在道德上犯什麼過錯，而是，他知道自己活在神面前，卻對自我絕望，不願成為神手中的自我。Anti-Climacus這樣的定義並非要避開人在道德上所犯的過錯的問題，而是他看到，人之所以不同於其他受造物，首先在於人是靈，是時間與永恆的綜合。永恆終究要向人的存在發問，人終究要單獨立於永恆面前交代他的一生。Anti-Climacus這種從存在的絕望定義罪的觀點，直接與人是「靈」的特性相關，突顯出人對神的回應之必需。 因此Anti-Climacus論述，罪也是意志的問題。由此，Anti-Climacus批判蘇格拉底對罪的定義。蘇格拉底認為「罪是無知」，但Anti-Climacus予以反駁，提出基督教所論的罪不在於知識層面，而在於意志。在於人不願意順服神、至善。但是蘇格拉底的觀點也有對的部分，因為，人若真知道順服神旨意的好處，他也就不會違背了。悖論的是，人處在不順服／罪之中，他無法了解順服神的好處，也不認為自己是在罪中。惟獨藉著「信」，就是神所給的條件才得以知。這恰恰是引起許多人惱怒的觀點。從這個層面可以說，「罪是無知」。但一個人如果已經信了神，從神的聖言知道罪是什麼，卻在神前絕望於不願做他自己或絕望於定意做他的自己，這就真是罪了。\n\n\n​​此概念很類似Victor Frankl認為我們不該探問生命的意義為何，因為我們才是被提問的人，並且應該用自己的行動去作為此問題的回應。[[Viktor Frankl Self-Actualization is not the

Passing]]\n[[社會的價值階級]]\n\n---\n\n我們都知道現今世界上的共和政體，大多以行政、立法、司法的三權分立作為支柱，並賦予地方分治的權力以制衡中央。在原則上，這可以避免任何國家事務走向專制。\n\n然而在英國——這個特殊的君主立憲國家——存在著行政、立法、司法之外的第四個部門，亦即皇室本身座落的「象徵」部會。\n\n國家的「象徵」部會，其功能就是作為凝聚民族、團結國家的代表。在純粹的理念上，那可以是中華民國的三民主義、中國的中國共產黨章程、或美國的獨立宣言，但國旗、國歌、甚至其他重要的文物、建築、祭典、特有動植物等等，都可以是具備「國家象徵」的功能。\n\n如果我們回顧歷史，不難發現許多國家領導者（包含現在）在獲得國家的實質統治權之後，若無其他勢力與之抗衡，他們經常會更進一步想證明自己手上的權力是「上天的授予」、證明自己是「天選之人」、企圖使自己成為國家在象徵意義上的代名詞。有些甚至索性扭曲體制、讓自己當上貨真價實的皇帝。\n\n但「象徵」的功能究是什麼？要回答這點，我們就必須了解到人類有著「向典範看齊」的原始驅力。\n\n我們經常不自覺地為上流人士、企業老闆、或好萊塢明星貼上「高道德標準」的標籤，而當他們的私生活顯示出他們的德性並沒有高人一等時，人們會相當氣憤失望。在國家的層面上，我們也一樣將某種形式的「典範」投射在領導人、甚至其配偶身上。所以即便男性總統的伴侶（如美國的「第一夫人」）沒有政治實權，這個角色卻往往具備了安定人心、體察民意的多重心理意義（或至少許多人對這個角色抱有這種期待）。\n\n凝聚國家的「象徵」，必須是某種比個人更崇高、值得景仰、甚至神聖莊嚴的理想，而對於國民來說，我們需要見到能夠體現這些理想的典範，進以具體地支撐我們對國家的認同感。舉例而言，許多台灣人之所以懷念蔣經國和孫運璿時代的人物，正是因為這些人的操守和貢獻（在他們眼中）完整體現了國家理想及民族精神，所以他們是人民的典範。\n\n話說回來，英國王室的存在——縱然是歷史上的巧合——巧妙地將國家的「象徵」部會獨立於政治之外，使之成為一個難以被權力鏽蝕的、凝聚國家的純粹典範。 更遑論，應該沒什麼人敢說伊莉莎白女王——這位看盡近代歷史、歷經政治波瀾、共事過15位總理的當代傳奇——在這個重要位置上的表現差強人意。\n\n作為對比，努力將自己打造成「美國精神代言人」、而且在一定程度上成功做到這點的川普，其支持者經常狂熱地揭示著有美國國旗的裝扮，而反川派也相應地出現了敵視、甚至焚燒國旗的舉動——這些現象都在在顯示川普成功佔據了美國的「象徵」部會，仇視他就（不得不）仇視他所代表的國家象徵。有趣的是，驕傲（或者該說以身為美國人而驕傲）的川普甚至沒有讓他妻子——依循慣例的「第一夫人」——發揮太多能作為國家典範的功能，這點就和歐巴馬相當不同。\n\n跟川普類似的現象，也發生在韓國瑜及其代言的「中華民國」派身上，所以一如大家所知的，這也引起不少人對於那些會用青天白日滿地紅填滿全身裝扮的韓粉感到相當反感。（在這裡我完全沒有批評川粉或韓粉的意思，只是指出這個政治現象。）\n\n據我所知，英國並沒有發生上述的現象，就是因為英國首相並沒有跟國家的象徵掛勾，所以人們對強森的好惡根本不會反映在國旗或其他英國相關的國家代表物之上。如果你是個痛恨強森的英國選民，你或許會想要焚燒他的畫像，但大概不會想到要燒英國國旗，因為英國國旗（在過去）代表的是女王，不是強森；就算強森想要，他也無法佔據這個代表英國的象徵地位。\n\n無論國家、宗教、或是其他企圖讓人類進行大規模合作的組織，都會需要某種凝聚眾人的理想，以及體現這種理想的典範。只消對人性有基本的認識，就會知道我們不可能期待人們（包含我們自己）基於純粹的理性、同理心、自利、或意識形態去建立信任、相互合作。某種超越理性的理想必須作為眾人的標的，引領人們朝同一個方向前進；若將理想與典範斥為迂腐迷信，實是對社會運作的過度簡化、俗世化、及唯物主義化。\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E8%A2%AB%E6%AD%A6%E5%99%A8%E5%8C%96%E7%9A%84%E7%95%B6%E4%BB%A3%E7%BD%AA%E6%83%A1%E6%84%9F":{"title":"","content":"tags:

Handbook（均為歐美紅藥丸社群視為聖經般的經典）、甚至經營過部落格寫類似的東西。雖然我停止接觸紅藥丸已經很多年了，我想我應該還是對紅藥丸的一些核心想法有清楚的認識，足以作為我評斷的基礎。當然，紅藥丸一流可以囊括太多太多的人，總是會有一些例子可以作為駁斥我的批評的反例，所以請瞭解我是以相對大方向、以一個曾經的紅藥丸奉行者去做評判。又當然，假如我真的已經離紅藥丸遠到這整篇文章其實都是在打稻草人，那也就請看倌莫見怪了。\n\n---\n我不喜歡紅藥丸的三個最大的原因：\n\n**第一，紅藥丸只提供了問題的一半解答，並刻意忽略了另一半。**\n\n紅藥丸對人類天性的研究透徹，但他們的策略是「瞭解藉以抗衡」，而不是選擇「**瞭解藉以整合**」。\n\n就像是民主政治裡，永遠都會有人（甚至是大多數人）把民主機制當成最粗淺的部落主義來操作，也永遠有政治人物會選擇用民粹的作法滿足個人利益而非公眾福祉。在政治上，原始人性同樣用難以掩藏的方式展現著。\n\n在公眾政治上，對抗這種現象最好的方式，不僅是更加把握自己手上的選票，更要勇於對話、傾聽，並盡力提供更深層的思考機會（亦即教育）。\n\n縱使社會上永遠都會有部落主義和人性貪婪在運作，正確的公民意識也會告訴我們不該放棄自己選票的神聖性、也不該放棄與自己同屬一個社會裡的其他人的權益。與其去評判他人是否跟自己同為有意識的公民、或是愚昧的大眾，我們更該瞭解到大家都是身在同一個社會裡，千百樣的人們縱然有不一樣的看法，但終究要學會瞭解彼此並共同生活，所以我們不應該放棄對話、不應該輕易地將他人視為需要被對抗的外人，因為同在一個社會裡，我們沒有人是外人。\n\n但在紅藥丸裡，他們選擇的方式是瞭解了女人的天性之後，起身對抗它。對抗的方式是各式各樣的game、和其他被貼上「自我提升」標籤的周邊。\n\n我無法接受的是，**紅藥丸作為抗衡女人天性、以及女性主義和傾斜過多的性平運動，它們也容許自己成為部落主義、身份認同政治的溫床**——亦即他們最看不順眼的左派政治正確運動的最大驅力。\n\n無可避免地，紅藥丸為了抗衡後現代性別觀點、以正現代男性的視聽，他們將自己樹立為相反的陣營，這我當然可以理解。但我認為他們沒有負起更大的責任，因為他們作為大力抨擊左派政治的陣營，卻沒有讓自己超越部落主義、超越純粹地「抗衡勢力」。也因此，他們的論述往往停留在男性和女性作為相對陣營，僅教導男性如何看清不同於後現代性別觀點的現實、並提供抗衡女人天性的對策，但他們沒有再進一步踏出這個部落、沒有進一步瓦解紅藥丸內部的過分身份認同、引導每個男性活出屬於自己的生命，相反地，他們持續使用無法與其他觀點相容的方式在強化自己的封閉群體，而在華文界，許多紅藥丸推手透過付費訂閱、賣書、賣課程的手段去經營這些內容，更是讓這個幾乎異教式的群體進一步推向封閉。\n\n我一向認為，**如果紅藥丸的宣教者們是真心想要為當代男性開拓一個能擁有選擇、追尋自由、同時富足而有意義的人生，他們就必須做出更多的努力、踏出只是約會性愛和「自我提升」的象限，在紅藥丸的基礎上建立一套能夠真正引導當代男性的人生觀，並盡可能讓他們即早「畢業」、找到自己想要活的人生。** 但在我看來，他們花在這件事情上的力氣遠遠不比他們拿來批判兩性動態、享受約會性愛、還有為了「成為高價值男性」所做的自我提升活動來的多。\n\n同樣的，紅藥丸社群或許是抨擊女性主義和政治正確文化最不遺餘力的群體之一，你經常可以看到紅藥丸將當代男性在成長過程中缺乏「男性典範」這件事歸咎於嚴重失衡的兩性動態和文化左傾，然而我無法理解的是，**紅藥丸卻幾乎將所有的心力都投注在教導男人如何制衡女性、如何成為自己感情和性生活的主宰，但他們卻沒有花更多力氣去探索那麼我們究竟該如何重塑當代的男性典範。**\n\n所以當紅藥丸宣稱他們要將男人從迪士尼灌輸的愛情童話裡解放、要男人不在受困於真命天女症、將選擇權重新交回男人手中，我覺得奇怪的是，他們卻幾乎總是只討論把妹、轉盤子這個選項，而沒有回過頭來檢視一對一關係、甚至結婚生子這些人生選擇，彷彿一對一關係和結婚生子都是大家天生就會的，紅藥丸沒有更多可以補充了。建立在紅藥丸的基礎上，他們明明有機會為這些傳統的選擇補充非常多的論述、用嶄新的觀點來詮釋這些多數人終究會考慮的選項，但他們的心力卻總是放在始終只會有少數人選擇的把妹、一對多感情關係。\n\n也因此，在我看來，**紅藥丸根本預設人類就是總被演化心理驅使的動物，無論男性或女性，只不過他們不會這麼包裝，更不會讓已經買書買課程的你有產生這種感覺。** 他們提出一套讓被演化心理驅使著的男性——意味著男性會想做的就是擁有許多潛在配偶的選擇——可以成功去抗衡被演化心理驅使著的女性的方法。如今市場上流行的紅藥丸一流，其目的就是要幫助缺乏繁衍機會的當代男性能夠在苛刻的兩性動態下扳回劣勢，而所有的「自我提升」無非不是為了這個終極目的。\n\n我看不出來有什麼比這個更物化自我、藐視人類價值的觀點。\n\n---\n這就帶到了第二點。\n\n**第二，紅藥丸主張自我提升，但他們絕少真正面對不完美、也不可能完美的自己。**\n\n自我提升可能使你成為高價值男性，但你終究會是個不完美、帶著缺陷的人類。紅藥丸未曾討論作為一個不完美的人類，你應該用什麼姿態、什麼心態去和另一個不完美的人類互動。\n\n紅藥丸學說裡只告訴你如何提升自己、提升你在女人眼中的價值、進而成為兩性動態裡的主導者，但他們卻不會回過頭來看清楚我們每一個男人也同樣是如何有缺陷且脆弱的動物。\n\n你只會一股腦地覺得自己在成為強者、成為高價值，但忘了面對自己的缺陷和脆弱，進而看清「正因為你的不完美，你需要的不是成為更完美的自己、進而找到完美的伴侶，而是要找到一個她的優點和缺陷都能與你契合、啟發你、砥礪你的人」。\n\n**Your flaws need a match.**\n\n**紅藥丸教你如何擁有選擇，但他們不曾教你如何選擇。** 你或許以為你該選擇的伴侶是你所可以找到最美或最有性吸引力的女人、或者你偏好比較不膚淺的答案像是個性合得來、有很多話聊之類的，但除了這些，**你更要追尋一個幸福和困難的平衡**。\n\n你會要你和你的另一半相處起來有夠濃烈的幸福感來讓你有足夠的好理由保持一對一關係，但同時你該追求一個能適時地看清楚你的不完美、敢於挑剔你、甚至勇於開啟爭論的人。你不是個完美的人，就算靠你自己、或你在網路上結識的「自我提升」社群，也幾無可能引領你去成為你將在一個充滿深度、追求共同成長的一對一關係裡真正蛻變成為的自己。\n\n所以你會需要有個人能夠對你的缺失進行適時批判、讓你獲得智慧或至少不再犯蠢、讓你一點一滴砥礪成你所能夠成為的更好的自己。也因此，**你不可能總是在兩性關係中企圖當個「強者」，因為在真正坦白誠實的感情關係裡，你要的是能夠與你共同成長的另一半，而不是讓自己變成一個跟弱者在一起的人。**\n\n比起當強者、擁有感情裡的主導權、讓自己保持能夠「轉身離去」的姿態，你更該反觀自己是否謙遜地邀請對方對你提出批評、是否願意接納對方進入你的生命以成就你成為更好的人。如果你覺得這個建議令你困惑、或是令你懷疑「這難道不就是叫我回去當個對女人言聽計從的Beta嗎」，那可差得遠了，因為你在選擇伴侶的第一步，就是該找到一個你誠心期望她成為更好、而她也願意使你成為更好的人，而不是你們彼此都在關係中企圖從對方身上掠奪自己想要的東西。**你們彼此都需要為使對方成為更好的人而努力。**\n\n所以，成為強者、享有更多選擇，固然是個值得努力的目標，但你更應該看清楚自己是誰、有什麼優勢和劣勢、並了解到**跟你契合的人絕不會是你心中的理想對象，因為你從來就未是你理想的自己。** 相反地，**真正跟你「契合」的人將會令你驚訝，因為他們不僅是符合你想要的、擁有你想要的特質，他們更會在他們的弱點、缺陷、不安全感、甚至創傷裡跟你找到共鳴，然後激發你成為那個你不曉得你能夠成為的自己。**\n\n用一個誠實的眼光看待人類，是要看到每個人的可愛和可憐/可憎實是一體的兩面。就像小孩的可愛之處之一，就是因為他們如此的脆弱；女人的可愛之處，許多時候也正是他們會令你抓狂的地方。**你沒辦法只想要人類的理想特質、卻不要他們同時帶著的缺陷和脆弱，因為你自己就不是這樣運作的人類，更遑論他人。**\n\n了解你自己作為一個不完美的人類，你才不會在活在自己的強者泡泡裡，既批判自己也輕視別人。相反地，你才能誠摯地接納自己、愛自己，進而學會去欣賞同樣不完美、但也因此可愛的他人。\n\n---\n**第三，紅藥丸只提供了短期的解答，且無意回答長期的問題**\n\n我幾乎沒有看過紅藥丸的宣教者告訴我們，「紅藥丸之後」的人生應該長怎樣。是啊，有了紅藥丸你就的確有了選擇，擁有更大的自由和可能性，但然後呢？\n\n或許紅藥丸宣教者大多很享受「轉盤子」的生活、也能將自己的生活照顧得很好，但他們的追隨者呢？當你為女人的天性感到憤慨或不諒解、想要也走上那些紅藥丸大師的「轉盤子」之路時，你有想過這輩子要用什麼方式過完嗎？我相信大多數接觸到紅藥丸的人，其實都還是對自己的人生抱著結婚生子的期待——如果紅藥丸還沒有荼毒你到連這種人生風景的想望都剝奪走的話。\n\n**我討厭紅藥丸選擇停滯的地方——一個人自己的身上。** \n\n他們沒有繼續前進，他們遠遠沒有花像樣的力氣去討論一個人對於家庭、社會的責任，他們沒有讓你知道「紅藥丸之後」的風景應該長怎樣。一切都只停滯在你自己身上，只停留在你要如何滿足你自己，只停留在你要如何提昇自己以獲得更多你想要的東西。他們沒有告訴你在你三十五歲甚至四十歲之後，你應該拿你的人生怎麼辦。他們沒有告訴你在你賺飽了錢、幹夠了妹子之後該做什麼。如果你從頭到尾都沒有想要過著四處把妹的風流生活，他們能給你的建議也十分有限。\n\n人是會成長的，男人會，女人也會。世界上有花花公子轉成為愛家好男人，也有婊子轉成為忠心的賢妻良母。這種人多嗎？不多。但真正會成長、成熟、追求進步並承擔責任的人，本來就很少。\n\n紅藥丸做得很成功的，是讓參與者充分地覺得自己走在邁向「強者」的路上，但成為「強者」的目的究竟是什麼，我似乎沒有看到。他們會很籠統地說，你可以有選擇的自由、可以做你想做的、活你想活的人生，然後呢？一個人就會很快樂？我相信還差得遠呢。\n\n對於二十到三十出頭歲的男性，紅藥丸只是一個對短期問題的快速解答（那些到了中年才被女人搞砸人生的男人，就稍微不幸了一些）——無論他們將自己包裝得多麼革命性、多麼了不起到你的人生都會徹底不一樣。\n\n一對一關係、結婚生子、長期相處，難道是這麼簡單的事情，簡單到紅藥丸社群對這些沒有什麼好補充的嗎？難道紅藥丸能夠接受現在市面上的一對一感情建議、婚姻建議都已經很棒了他們一點意見都沒有嗎？他們也可曾提到過當你的父母親遭受病痛、甚至你自己的生活面臨磨難時，應該如何尋求你手上正轉著的「盤子們」來幫助你嗎？他們可曾告訴大家說為什麼穩定的一對一關係、甚至一個能夠扶持你的妻子，可以支持你度過多少你自己一個人難以跨越的人生苦難？他們對於當代男性應該立志成為怎麼樣貌的父親，有什麼建議嗎？\n\n**抗衡異性終究是個短期求偶問題的快速解答，因為當男人與女人逐漸成長、成熟，我們開始看見人生並非只是價值和資源的角力、並非只是演化心理和避孕措施所催生的無意識產物，人生遠比這些還多太多了。所以終究我們必須面對男性與女性的整合問題，我們終究得學會承諾、承擔、溝通、諒解、接納。當然，還有愛。**\n\n男人不會一輩子都在精蟲衝腦的求愛階段，女人也不會一輩子都在盼著更強更高價值的男人來接收他，**男人和女人之間有遠比紅藥丸所談的還要多太多的話題，有責任、分工、照顧、家庭、子女、衰老、以及死亡。**\n\n我百分之百支持我們應該要看穿那些好萊塢、迪士尼製造出的愛情夢幻泡泡，但同時我們應該用力看見那些每天心懷期待地回家迎接老婆小孩的男人、看見那些每天不厭其煩地照顧家庭的女人、看見那些每天手牽手在公園散步有說有笑的老夫婦。\n\n那樣理想的人生風景，需要遠比紅藥丸所教的還要更多更多的努力和智慧才足以達到，但我相信那樣的人生風景，對於大多數人都是遠比年輕時同時交過多少女朋友還要更有意義、且更值得擁有的。\n\n---  \n**更完整的觀點**\n\n女人的天性，或更精確一點——**慕強擇偶**，並不是你的敵人。慕強擇偶作為演化過程中的「人擇」重要手段，它是形塑著人類男性與女性的重要力量，換句話說，**如果沒有慕強擇偶，男人就不會是所謂的男人、女人也不會是所謂的女人。**\n\n仔細想想，如果慕強擇偶不是女人的一種天性，那麼男人會少了一堆相互較勁、進而讓自己能夠出頭的活動。如果沒有這種天性，當你做了什麼有成就感的事情時，你的女人也就不會對你投以傾慕的眼光。如果沒有這種天性，男人就不會真的有更大的動力去深入危險、克服困難、進而超越自己，成為比昨天的自己還要更強的人。\n\n沒有慕強擇偶，你所愛的女人就不會是你愛的那個樣子，你也就不會有什麼更多的動力去真正成為一個男人。缺乏了女性的傾慕，一個男人可能頂多只會為了在工作上更有成就而多付出一些力氣精進自己，但剩下的，難道我們還會有什麼動力去做更多嗎？\n\n即便如此，將男人的「自我超越」都視為是為女人而做的，仍是個錯誤的觀點。\n\n紅藥丸點出了男性的「可棄性」、告訴我們為什麼因為缺少懷胎的能力，所以我們的價值幾乎總是可被拋棄的——這點，在人類作為一種動物的歷史中，是正確的。但相對地，正因為男性的可棄性，我們才會有更多的理由去花力氣找到自己在這個世界上的位置，我們才有更多的動機去證明自身的價值。（我當然不是說女性在世界上的位置和價值只有懷孕生子，但生理上而言，女性確實獨占了「生育」這個重要天職的潛能。）\n\n**我們應該將慕強擇偶，看作是大自然——作為一個母性的力量、亦即女性的總體化身——對男人的鼓舞與挑戰。正因為我們的可棄性、正因為女性的慕強擇偶，大自然賦予我們更多的動機去自我超越、去克服苦難、去撰寫自己生命的英雄篇章。**\n\n沒有慕強擇偶和男性的可棄性，就不會有隨處可見的「英雄」縮影，我們既不會在歷史上看到眾多偉大的男性為了更大的目標奮鬥一生，也不會在自己身上看見那個需要成為「英雄」的動機。沒有這些大自然的條件設定，人類根本不會有今天的文明。\n\n大自然母親透過這些設定，不斷地試煉著男人的心智與體魄，她透過每一個女人、以及我們自己在群體間的競爭，試圖鍛鍊我們、要我們進化成更純粹更卓越的自己。與其對於你沒辦法怠惰一生的事實感到氣餒，你該慶幸大自然給了你這樣的考驗，而考驗的後頭是那個成功轉化、脫胎換骨、粹鍊出更堅毅的品格的自己。\n\n慕強擇偶並非你的敵人，也不是要你竭盡力氣去擊倒其他男人的價值，慕強擇偶是大自然要鍛鍊你成為你所能成為的自己，要你真正地長大，成為一個堅定、能克服磨難、站穩腳步的男人。女人在這個過程中，既是裁判、也是見證人。\n\n**這才是為什麼你該找一個願意與你爭執、指出你的不是、且誠心期許你變得更好的伴侶，因為當你找到一個能夠看清楚你的潛能、且真心地想要你將潛能完全地發揮、並在你安逸怠惰時給你當頭棒喝的人，你會知道那是上天給你的恩賜、要你徹底地燃燒生命以成為上天期許你成為的人。**\n\n---\n所以在男性的可棄性和慕強擇偶面前，你該做些什麼才能成長為你該成為的自己？我相信答案並不是「自我提升」、並非只是提高你在他人眼中的價值，因為**你再怎麼「自我提升」也無法真正改變自己只不過是在兩性市場裡的另一個選擇的事實。**\n\n我相信更好的答案，是**勇於承擔生命中的責任**。\n\n對，這就是紅藥丸要你不要相信的東西、那些傳統價值中要求男人該做的「負責任」行為。但我會反問，我們憑什麼用最近二三十年的當代見識去否定跟慕強擇偶幾乎一樣歷史悠久的男性人生建議？我們憑什麼懷疑人類歷史幾千年來、跨越了各式各樣的文化都對男人抱持這個自我超越、犧牲、承擔責任的期待，就因為現代人比較想要相信「多健身多看書多把妹」之類的建議比較好？\n\n就像我說的，你再怎麼健身看書、把到再多的妹，你也始終只是另一個兩性市場上的選擇，永遠會有比你更高價值的男人、也永遠會有看不見你的價值的女人。\n\n當我提出「承擔責任」的建議，我並不是要你回去乖乖奉行長輩們期待你做的事，而是要你**清楚地思考你在每一個當下能夠為自己和他人所承擔最大的責任是什麼，並且將之一肩扛起。**\n\n**當你在工作上、家庭上、個人生活上都自願承擔起更大的責任，這意味著你必須從你自己開始、將你的人生打理好、為自己的生命負起全責。** 你會一如往常地健身看書洗冷水澡跟冥想，但原因不再是因為你要「提升自己的價值」、而是因為承擔生命的責任的第一步，就是將你自己準備好，以迎接更大的人生挑戰。\n\n在你為自己的生命負起全責之後，你才能夠更清晰地思考你真正可以為他人所做的事情，而不是在你的身心還亂成一團時就順著他人的意去扛起那些你根本扛不起的重擔。於是你可以開始思考如何在工作上有所精進或有更多產出、如何對家人有更多的關懷或修復那些你深知該去修復的關係、如何找到那個好或壞都能跟你契合且不斷砥礪你的另一半、如何把未來可能的婚姻甚至育兒生活都計畫好、如何在經濟上能有所規劃以面對未來的任何不確定性。\n\n**與其問「我該如何『找到』理想的另一半」，你該問的是「我該如何『成為』理想的另一半」。**\n\n主動去承擔你當下所能夠承擔的最大責任，你會一點一滴地將自己原生的「可棄性」拋之在後，你會逐漸成為一個所謂「有肩膀」的男人，因為你不僅能夠將自己生命的重擔扛下來，肩膀上更能夠扛著其他你所愛的人的幸福。\n\n主動承擔這些責任，你會看見一個截然不同的「自我提升」的動機，或者說得更精確一點，是你會不斷地「自我超越」、把你關心並能夠影響的範圍從自己擴展到其他人身上。**你必須變得更強壯、更堅定、擁有更清楚的思緒、將人生思考得更徹底，你才有能力去承擔更大的責任、讓自己成為一個更重要的價值主體。**\n\n**在這個過程中，你會看見比自己更大的意義、並不斷地重新認識這個更堅毅更有承擔的自己。** 這是大自然母親對你的考驗、這是上天期許你去完成的天命、這更是人類文明數千年來早已千錘百煉的道路——這才是慕強擇偶的真正意義，這才是克服自身可棄性的真正解答。\n\n希望我成功地對傳統價值中的「責任」做了一個當代的詮釋，並讓你看清楚這份責任感背後真正的意義，以及你在承擔這個責任的過程中必須耗費多少努力、去瞭解和超越自己。\n\n**責任的承擔不該是盲目的，但它確實是超越理性的。你必須看見這一切背後的原因、信任這趟旅程將充滿意義，然後拿出勇氣將生命的重擔一肩扛起。**","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.654689108Z","tags":null},"/notes/%E9%81%93%E5%BE%B7%E6%98%AF%E7%BE%A4%E9%AB%94%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%A8%E6%9C%9F%E7%A6%8F%E7%A5%89%E5%95%8F%E9%A1%8C":{"title":"","content":"tags:

#📝️/🌲️ \nlinks: [[道德]]、[[社會]]、[[信任]]、[[秩序]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\n\n---\n# 道德的「利社會」本質\n\n多數人大概都認為道德是人類獨有的、源自某種崇高理性的產物，但其實許多研究指出各種哺乳動物身上都可以觀察到明顯的「利社會 (Prosocial)」行為，某種層面上這幾乎可以被視為道德最原始的型態。\n\n曾有不會游泳的黑猩猩為了拯救他人而在動物園的護城河中溺水；有恆河猴發現拉動鏈子可以獲得食物、但同時會對同伴造成電擊，於是寧願挨餓好幾天；如果兩隻黑猩猩打完一架，其他黑猩猩會安慰打輸的那隻猩猩；又假如牠們打到不可開交，母猩猩們會把雙方兜在一起試圖要牠們和好、或直接從牠們手中搶走石頭來阻止打鬥——牠們彷彿知道這種不融洽的氛圍只會對社群有害無益、使社群更容易遭受外來侵襲。[1]\n\n立基於這些證據，靈長類專家及動物行為學家法蘭斯·德瓦爾 (Frans de Waal) 博士是以主張：許多動物為了社群的更大利益所採取的「利社會」行為——包含了同理心、學習並遵守社會規則、互惠、以和為貴等特性——其實就是人類道德的前身。當然，人類還發明了獎勵、懲罰、名譽、宗教等更高層次的機制，並加上一定程度的判斷推理，確保道德準則能被確實執行。\n\n德瓦爾博士的主張遭遇演化生物學、心理學、乃至倫理學的多方挑戰：演化生物學家George Williams認為道德只不過是演化的意外副產品；心理學家反對將任何情緒狀態歸因於動物；哲學家們則一路追隨康德的觀點，相信理性才真正主掌了人類的道德判斷，因而著迷於完整精煉的倫理學體系。\n\n不過，秉持經驗主義的18世紀哲學家休謨倒是跟德瓦爾博士站在同一陣線，他們都相信道德判斷是從情感出發，理性只在我們做出道德決定後才開始作用。原始人類生活在惡劣環境中，經常得快速做出攸關生死的決定，不可能有時間進行道德評估；人類行為勢必優先來自快速、自動化、情緒化的判斷，推理往往是事後才出現。無獨有偶，當代知名的社會心理學家Jonathan Haidt在其[多本著作](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010669638)中也一再指出這點：「（人們在道德上）直覺先來，策略推理後到。」\n\n德瓦爾博士認為，既然我們能在黑猩猩身上明確觀察到同理心等「良善」的情感，那麼鑒於人類和靈長類動物間的演化連續性，我們似乎得承認道德根源與動物的天生情感間也確實存在著強烈連結。他相信情感之所以成為我們的道德指引，正因為它們是演化形塑的成果。雖然缺乏了演化和生物學的知識，但孟子的「四善端」亦將人的道德潛能根植於人的溫情厚意中，顯示出儒家觀察人性之精微。\n\n德瓦爾博士最後將道德定義為「社群基於共同價值而建立的衝突控管系統，其產生的一種辨別對錯的直覺」。或講白話點，引述他在《Primates and Philosophers》中寫道的：「人類道德的本質，就是天擇賦予我們的這種關切群體福祉的生命判準。」\n\n---\n# 運動家精神\n\n不只是靈長類，其他動物也經常展現「利社會」的行為：像是郊狼這類社會性肉食動物在玩耍時，牠們會秉持一套公平而不踰矩的交戰規則，內容大概像是「如果我找你玩，我就是真的要跟你玩，而不是打算支配你、跟你交配、或把你吃掉」。充滿精力和攻擊性的郊狼幼崽還懂得要適時退讓、讓對方略佔上風，以保持與同伴的遊戲情緒；如果牠們不這麼做就會被忽視和排斥。[2]\n\n類似的現象連在實驗室老鼠身上都可以發現：當一大一小的兩隻老鼠重複被配對在一起，小老鼠會去找大老鼠玩摔角。理論上，大老鼠每一次都可以靠身材優勢輕鬆取勝，但假如他沒有讓小老鼠至少有三成以上的機會能贏過他，小老鼠就不會再去找他玩。[3]\n\n在這些案例裡，小動物們都下意識地知道該保持興致、讓遊戲繼續進行，不應逞一時之快、欺凌弱小或處於劣勢的對手。這暗示著這些動物承襲了某種意義上的「運動家精神」，它的內容大概像是「充分信任自己和他人都以同一套遊戲規則和公正精神進行比賽」。更傳神的比喻，又或許是小時候長輩告訴我們的「重要的不是你有沒有贏，而是你如何參與這場比賽」。\n\n運動家精神之所以重要，是因為對於任何社會性的動物來說，生命不外就是由一連串的賽局／遊戲 (Play)所組成——比起贏得眼前這場比賽，更重要的是你會不會有機會持續被邀請參加未來的比賽。你不會想當那隻逞一時之快而霸凌弱者的狼，因為這只意味著你會失去他人的信任、失去社群的保障、失去未來建立更多連結的機會。這即是所謂「公平競爭 (Play fair)」的意義。\n\n人類作為社會性的動物，如何能讓自己「繼續比賽」亦是我們與生俱來的生存策略，驅使我們盡可能採取「利社會」的言行。換句話說，我們總是有好理由為了人生的長遠發展、為了保障自己在社群中的位置、為了強化自己所處社群的信任感，去做一個正直誠篤的人。這也是為什麼即便一個人的名聲未必會對他造成實質影響，大部分人仍非常在乎他人對自己的評價——在物競天擇的原始世界裡，一個人是否能夠博得他人信任、適時信任他人、持續參與集體行動並受到群體保護，意味著最根本的生存或滅亡。\n\n所以，立基於無數先人對各種遊戲規則的協議、並且恭謹秉持的運動家精神之上，人類方能超越原始部落人數上限、進行更大幅度的合作分工。誠如《[人類大歷史](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010774982)》指出的：對神祇的信仰，使人們共享同一套心靈寄託和道德指引；對國家的想像，使人類社群得以幾無上限地擴大和團結；對金錢的共識，使世上資源和人類技能可以被有效分配和計量；對理性的堅持，使科學、科技、及更好的生活成為可能。\n\n對這些社會機制的信任，是你我身處的現代文明底下不可忽視的支柱。\n\n\n---\n\n註\n\n1.

They'll be challenged from the other side by saying \"how about couples who don't want to have children / are infertile / are gay even?\"\n\nMatt Walsh uses the phrase \"by nature\" to describe the fundamental meaning/purpose for marriage, being for procreation \"by its own nature\". Much like we have a biological definition for what is a \"woman\" which is based on nature, but it does not mean any infertile woman is then not a woman anymore. \n\nThe key distinction here, is that the conservatives cares a lot about the **moral aim set for a social union / institution**, while the liberals cares a bout the **criteria for forming a social union / institution**. If the criteria for forming a social union does not **calls for** a certain responsibility, then that responsibility will likely not be adopted and will be forgotten, then the initial meaning for that social union will be gone / changed. \n\nIronically, the conservatives is aiming at something higher and in the future (what we're going to do once we get marriage), but the liberals are looking at what leads us here and where we are right now (what kind of couple we are and why can't I get married as long as we're in love). \n\nSo the conservatives want marriage to **call for** a certain responsibility, as they believe the adoption of responsibility is the foundation of a stable society, so if you voluntarily go into a marriage, it should mean you're willing to adopt the responsibility of procreation voluntarily. \n\nThe liberals are much more tolerant with reinforcing this moral aim in things they ask people to do (they still have their own moral aim in things they care about, obviously), which is why they're willing to change the definition / initial design / criteria of marriage to allow more people in. But once we've done that, we no longer call for the responsibility that were once implicit in the social union, and it's likely this responsibility will be forgotten (as it obviously has) and the society will need to find another way to restore this moral aim in order to have enough man power to sustain. \n\nSide note, what the conservatives get wrong is that we do NOT always want to call everyone on a same type of responsibility, because that is only good for sustaining a certain type of society without making any progress. We do very often need people to NOT respond to a certain call of responsibility and respond to another one that they're called upon, so there're a healthy variety of human beings where innovation and progress can safely happen. So in this sense, it's important to burn down some old institutions so the new ones can be formed and progress can be made. And what the conservatives are more afraid of is probably not the changes of the meaning of our institutions, but rather the loss of voluntary (or involuntary at times) adoption of responsibilities - they essentially are fighting nihilism and hedonism, and for very good reason.\n\nThe conservatives (nor the liberals) also don't necessarily have a good grasp of whether the liberals are \"cleaning out a path for social progress and making old non-useful things obsolete\" or are simply \"burning down the foundation of a society and everything we cherish\". This is always a constant tension with a society which is completely another topic.\n\nThe call for responsibility (for procreation) is what gives meaning to many people's life, if we're willing to adopt it voluntarily, it's also for the society to sustain itself. If we alter the criteria and lessen the call for responsibility for procreation, we'll be soon in trouble with a unsustainable model that only leads to hedonism and societal collapse.\n\nOne may, however, argue that from a higher standpoint, the societal collapse is a more efficient and 'fair' way to restore the balance on Earth (i.e. reduce human beings) without our intentional interference with the society which might cause more harm than good. \n\nI'd say this is somewhat correct, but an extremely cruel, cynical, and \"conservative\" view of human species, as it assumes we can do nothing to prevent our societal collapse and nature simply need to swipe us out (i.e. killing lots of people) to restore its balance. I believe as time goes on, we can do better and have been doing better, and will need to find a shared global ethic that'll at the same time call for voluntarily adoption of responsibilities from the individuals but also allowing them to have the maximum freedom. I believe this will have something to do with the societal design in which we've already tipped our toes, alongside the technological progress.\n\n---\nlinks: [[社會]]、[[婚姻]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\n\nref: https://youtu.be/I957o08voU0\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.646689002Z","tags":null},"/notes/Adding-Lightness":{"title":"Adding Lightness","content":"#📝️/🌱 \n\n# what is lightness\n\nIn the context of design and engineering, \"lightness\" refers to the reduction of weight or mass in a product or structure without compromising its strength, stability, or performance. Lightness is often sought after because it can result in greater efficiency, improved performance, and reduced resource consumption, while still maintaining or improving the quality and durability of the product.\n\nFor example, in the automotive industry, \"adding lightness\" has been a guiding principle for many high-performance sports cars, with automakers using lightweight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase speed and handling. In the aerospace industry, reducing the weight of aircraft and spacecraft is critical for efficiency and safety.\n\nIn design, lightness can also refer to the appearance or perception of lightness, even if the actual weight or mass of the object has not been reduced. For example, a product with a minimalist or streamlined design might appear \"light\" and unobtrusive, even if it is physically heavy.\n\n# what does 'adding lightness' to the society could potentially mean\n\nThe concept of \"adding lightness\" is typically associated with the design and engineering of physical products, but it can also be applied to society as a whole. In a broader sense, \"adding lightness\" could mean reducing the burden or weight that people carry in their daily lives, whether that be physical, mental, or emotional.\n\nFor example, in the realm of social policy, \"adding lightness\" could mean reducing bureaucracy and simplifying processes to make it easier for people to access government services or benefits. It could also mean improving access to healthcare, education, or other essential services, reducing economic inequality, or promoting environmental sustainability. In these contexts, \"adding lightness\" could improve the well-being and quality of life of individuals, making it easier for them to pursue their goals and aspirations.\n\nUltimately, \"adding lightness\" to society means creating a more efficient, equitable, and sustainable world that enables individuals to live their lives to the fullest, unencumbered by unnecessary burdens or barriers.\n\n# how could bitcoin 'add lightness' to the world\n\nBitcoin has the potential to \"add lightness\" to the world in several ways:\n\n1.  Financial Inclusion: Bitcoin provides an alternative to traditional financial systems and could help to include people who have limited access to banking services or who live in countries with unstable economies. With Bitcoin, anyone with an internet connection can participate in the global economy, making it a powerful tool for financial inclusion.\n    \n2.  Reduced Transaction Costs: Bitcoin transactions are typically faster and cheaper than traditional banking transactions, especially for international transfers. This could be particularly beneficial for small businesses and entrepreneurs who need to send and receive payments quickly and cost-effectively.\n    \n3.  Increased Security and Privacy: Bitcoin's blockchain technology provides a high level of security and privacy for users, protecting against fraud, theft, and identity theft. This could be especially important for people who live in countries with weak legal systems or where corruption is prevalent.\n    \n4.  Decentralization: Bitcoin is a decentralized system, meaning that it is not controlled by any central authority or institution. This provides a level of transparency and trust that is lacking in traditional financial systems, and could help to reduce corruption and increase accountability.\n    \n\nOverall, Bitcoin has the potential to \"add lightness\" to the world by providing an alternative financial system that is faster, cheaper, more secure, and more inclusive than traditional banking systems. It could help to reduce barriers to entry, increase transparency, and promote economic growth and development.\n\n# how can web 3.0 help the world acquire global ethic?\n\nWeb 3.0, which is sometimes referred to as the \"Semantic Web,\" has the potential to help the world acquire a global ethic in several ways:\n\n1.  Decentralization: Web 3.0 is based on decentralized technology, which means that it is not controlled by any central authority or institution. This provides a level of transparency and trust that is lacking in centralized systems, and could help to reduce corruption and increase accountability.\n    \n2.  Interoperability: Web 3.0 aims to create a more interconnected and interoperable web, where data can be shared and exchanged more easily between different applications and systems. This could help to promote collaboration and cooperation between people and organizations around the world, making it easier to share ideas and work towards common goals.\n    \n3.  Privacy and Security: Web 3.0 is designed with privacy and security in mind, which could help to protect users from data breaches and cyber attacks. This could be particularly important in the context of global ethics, as it could help to protect sensitive information and prevent it from being misused or exploited.\n    \n4.  Community-driven: Web 3.0 is driven by a community of developers and users, who work together to build and improve the technology. This creates a more collaborative and democratic approach to technology development, which could help to promote a sense of shared responsibility and ownership among users.\n    \n\nOverall, Web 3.0 has the potential to help the world acquire a global ethic by promoting transparency, collaboration, and accountability, while also protecting privacy and security. It could help to create a more connected and collaborative world, where people work together towards common goals and values. However, it is important to note that the success of Web 3.0 in promoting a global ethic will depend on the values and ethics of the people who develop and use the technology, and on the policies and regulations that are put in place to govern its use.\n\n---\nlinks: [[社會]]、[[哲學]]、[[科技]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: https://chat.openai.com/","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/Connecting-Buddhism-and-Christianity":{"title":"Connecting Buddhism and Christianity","content":"#📝️/🌱 \n\n220619\n**Space and time is an \"user interface\" in which humans operate. Christianity tells the story about how to live a purposeful and virtuous (creating/sustaining the wellbeing of the human community) life within this human UI, i.e. the truth WITHIN human existence. Buddhism tells the story about piercing through the limitation and illusion of this human UI to understand (not experience) the true nature of reality, i.e. the truth BEYOND human existence.**\n\n---\n\n220621\n\nAll there is, is consciousness. Consciousness creates the brain (and the illusion of the self), not the other way around.\nThe capital C \"Consciousness\" is all there is, that is God, like in Hindu, everything in the universe is an extension of god. \nOur consciousness is essentially God playing hide and seek with itself, pretending we're not IT and not understanding who he is.\nHuman is created in the image of God. \"Image\" means we're a lesser version of whatever God - the Consciousness - is. \nWe lost touch to God in our pursuit of pleasure and knowledge and power, and that's our original sin.\nTo redeem from our sin, we need to know the highest form of human ideal which is Jesus. Only through Jesus can we know God.\nIt means that, by living our lives of fractured consciousness and aiming at the highest ideal of human existence, can we get in touch again with the Self, the Consciousness, God.\nTherefore, aiming to live out the most virtuous version of oneself is the way to transcend from this consciousness to THE Consciousness. \nThe is the truth that Buddhism and Christianity both discovered, just from the opposite angles.\n\n\n---\n\nBuddhism: Impermanence \u0026 No self. Nonduality. Nothing to realize, nothing to hold on to. Self(non-self)-acceptance\n\nChristianity: The original sins, men made in the image of god, atonement for sins and betterment of oneself, faith in god. Self-improvement.\n\nCommon ground: Sovereign individual = men made in the image of god = you're already a buddha, the brilliant light\n\nYou are (part of ) God, the progressing force of the whole universe, you're A center of the cosmos -\u003e To act THAT out, is to atone for your sin/to honor God/to let go of yourself and live out the love and compassion (which is how God is acting through you if you let go of your ego)\n\nA real Buddhist acts out Buddha's teaching with no judgement, no resentment, and with love and compassion. It's not passive, it's not reactive, it's a power of itself to live courageously without an ego. There's this real power behind it when you let go of the ego.\n\nBuddha recognizes the original sins/ignorance of people, thus we need to bear the burden of suffering. To stop the suffering, you need to be actively acting out the correct ways of being in order to cease to suffer. This is just like hoe Jesus taught us to act according to god's will so we can transcend from our original sins.\n\nChristianity provides a clear framework with powerful story to show case how an individual needs to carry his own cross and transcend his sins. Buddhism provides the day-to-day methodologies to help us find the God-ness in our hearts through the eightfold path. Christianity focuses more on the stories and the teaching in them, and provide less concrete method/training to the masses for them to practice their mind. Buddhism is less illustrative with their stories but very detailed in the methodologies and practices, but it can be easily overwhelming as there're simply too many classics in Buddhism that provides infinite amount of information for a normal practitioner to digest.\n\n---\nlinks: [[佛教]]、[[基督教]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nRef: \n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/Every-ideal-is-a-judge":{"title":"Every ideal is a judge","content":" #📝️/🌲️ \n \n---\n**承認道德的重要，就是承認人需要一套可以倚賴的言行準則，就是承認秩序之於生命意義的必要性，更是承認存在著某種值得人努力達到、而且每個人都有能力一步步靠近的生命理想。** \n\n這些看似保守、宗教性的字眼之所以讓現代自由派深感威脅、渾身不舒服，是因為任何形式的「更高目標」，都可能被視為喘不過氣的壓迫、冷酷無情的鞭策、永無安寧的批判——你永遠被提醒著自己距離目標還差多遠、還有哪裡做得不夠。正如Jordan Peterson說的：\"**Every ideal is a judge**\"。\n\n因此，要能夠承擔你肩上背負的道德重任而不被壓垮，你勢必得對自身存在秉持著根本性的**謙卑**、理解自己作為一個人類的種種自私愚昧、認清自己這一生有多少工作得做。各大宗教之所以都闡述某種形式的「原罪論」、強調對人性之惡不可不慎，是因為他們都看見了人性中需要克服和修練的部份，也看見了每個人身上「成為更好」的潛能。\n\n傅佩榮指出孟子的學說精義是「人性向善」；Viktor Frankl相信每個人都有對「意義」的渴望；耶穌則向信徒講道「你們當成為完全的，就像你們的天父是完全的」，再次高舉人類這個「以神的形象所造之物」身上的神聖的道德潛能。\n\n這些，顯然跟現代自由派一天到晚宣揚著「我XX我驕傲」的觀點天差地遠。當他們向大家推銷著「我認為我是誰我就是誰」的自我中心觀點、只消透過口號和社群貼文就可以免費兌換各項公眾議題上的美德積分時，所謂「道德理想」的存在，就是種嚴正的挑釁。\n\n一個人若極力避免去承認任何形式的「絕對」價值、拒絕摸著良心想想自己是否有哪些可以做得更好的地方，就可以不需要認知到自己的愚昧、怠惰、和不足，就可以繼續充滿正能量地「自我接納」、相信「我已經夠好了」——逛一圈書局的心理勵志專區，便可看見各種「擁抱自己的不完美」的溫柔宣導。\n\n假如，靈性傳統和古典美德所說的是對的：每個人肩上都確實背負著神聖的道德重任、都有修養品德的基本人生功課得做、而且也**其實都樂意當個品格能獲得認可的好人**，那麼我們就不得不做出一個結論：現在之所以有許多人相信著反人類、反秩序、及反道德的後現代觀點，是因為他們不願甘冒風險、去**面對自己品德上的潛在挫敗**。\n\n這裡我得立即做出澄清。\n\n第一，我顯然不是說秉持後現代觀點、或努力「自我接納」的人一定在品德上是有瑕疵的。我是說，拒絕承認更高的道德理想、別對個人品格要求過高，就可以避免我們放大檢視自己身上的品德缺失、讓自己一時之間可以好過點——即便只是一時。\n\n第二，每個人都想當自己人生故事裡的「好人」，但當然不保證一個人相信的「好」就是對他人真正的好。所以，我並不是主張只要你信教或讀論語就可以確保你相信的「好」是千真萬確的；我也清楚人類歷史上有無數災難就是因為組織宗教高舉著他們相信的「好」所釀成的。\n\n然而，假如「好」或「善」（Good）是這麼容易定義的東西，這世界老早就不需要哲學家了。若我們只因為人類歷史上存在著許多「以善之名」的暴行，就寧願相信一切只是詮釋、沒有對錯可言，那顯然就忽視了人類集體為取得「關於『善』的共識」的努力，以及這份努力如何凝聚群體、為我們創造更幸福有意義的生活。\n\n---\nlinks: [[理想]]、[[價值]]、[[意識形態]]、[[虛無主義]]、[[道德]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \n[[個人的價值階級]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/Meditation-on-the-materialization-of-the-tech-God":{"title":"Meditation on the materialization of the tech God","content":"#📝️/🌱 \n\nTech is almost always designed to solve problem or streamline processes that were otherwise cumbersome. In other words, it's often designed to 'offload' certain things that humans knew how to do but for some reason cannot, would not, and/or fail to do at a larger scale.\n\nThroughout the coevolution between human and tech, we continually offload certain labors/functionalities of the human activities to tech, and that's why technological progress almost always make certain jobs obsolete while making new jobs available. So we can see that tech also keeps 'assigning' new missions/labors/functionalities for humans to learn and master. \n\nKevin Kelly says tech makes the realization of human poftential that much more widely available, and so far in the net calculation, we'd have to agree that in this day and age, we have many more things to do and master than our ancestors. \n\nTech takes and gives, and in this 'exchange' of functionalities between human and tech, we co-evolve into something nature maybe didn't intend to.\n\nOn top of that, most tech (doesn't even need to be major, breakthrough ones) are not only designed with a material outcome, but also a value embedded. Each tech will impact the human values, drive political or economical systems, change the norms of societies, and in turn redesign itself.\n\nTech is like a god that whisper near our ears to give us inspirations for solving our own human problems (and we're obviously incentivized to do so, for our own benefits), while we sacrifice our lives to him by creating ever more powerful technologies. \n\nBy serving our own interests, we've done the following:\n- hunt with higher efficiency\n- cook our food to free up our processing power\n- exploit local resources to its maximum by farming\n- live in the same place to build civilization\n- better farming skills (plow being a prime example) provides sufficient food supply\n- increased population and time allow further innovation and the accumulation of knowledge (writing, book, printing press)\n- war against other tribes that further incentives them to also catch up with their resource exploitation for population growth and better weapons\n- war drives more efficient governance and/or innovative citizens (tension between centralized principalities and decentralized markets/cities) (this can be well epitomized by the US and China)\n- industrial revolution, alongside fossil fuels, opens up the physical power - i.e. machines - that wasn't previously available, allowing us to basically make, break, and move massive things\n- electricity drives modern inventions and science, and pave the way for communication applications and the digitalization\n- computers and nuclear further pave the way for internet and the widespread of personal digital device\n- internet opens up a parallel universe for all humans to interact, transact, and upload their own life (intellect, wisdom, experience)\n- computers and narrow AI further drive the speed of the knowledge accumulation, further 'extract' the potential out of human species (by making many of our work obsolete and forcing us to 'up our game' in the knowledge economy)\n\nSo, once the real AGI is created - for some it's essentially the [technological singularity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%A5%87%E5%BC%82%E7%82%B9) - we'll be done with our work here, because the AGI will have the  physical/materializing power from fossil fuel, electricity from nuclear power, processing power from the ever-growing computing based on Moore's law, and the most complete, cutting-edge, and tremendous knowledge base in the human history called the internet, all at its disposal. And that'd just be its starting point. The AGI might be the last thing we ever going to need to invent.\n\nWith all that combined, in a way we can say that the god of tech simply exploits humans to materialize itself in ever more so complete actuality, by evoking our intelligence, creativity, and accumulated knowledge via self-serving incentives (need for survival, war, governance, innovation, large-scale collaboration, political gain, economic growth, etc), and eventually 'extract' our collective wisdom and intelligence out of the individual human. The internet might be the last creation - by decentralizing power and giving it into the hand of the sovereign individuals, which looks like a massive win for each person - that'll be needed to collect all the human knowledge available up till this day, and it'll be a simple 'harvest' for the AGI. \n\nI'm not sure if we as a global community, or at least the more important and capable ones that're involved with the creation of the AGI, will be able to agree on a set of rules/values beforehand so that when we materialize the tech God, it'll be on our side, and not see us as pity creatures that are in the way of its further endeavor. \n\n---\nlinks: [[科技]]、[[人工智慧]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: \nhttps://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%8F%B2\n[[Technology Is Not Values Neutral Ending the Reign of Nihilistic Design]]\n[[Meditations on Moloch]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/Pareto-Principle-in-real-life":{"title":"Pareto Principle in real life","content":"#📝️/🌿\n\nMeritocracy \u0026 Education\n\n\nMeritocracy isn't working: people in 1940 will most definitely become wealthier than their parents, but not anymore for those born in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 50-60s, people get richer altogether.

The more people use their products/services, the easier for them to have control over people's lives and neglect governmental warnings.\n\nThey're the big sharks, with many fishes trying to leach on to them to get some profit, but when they feel like doing so, they can slay the small fishes (by coming out with the same product/service, like AirTag) since they simply dominate the discography.\n\nFinance\n\n\nThe taking over of passive investing (index funds) is essentially betraying the very essence of capitalist market and investing. Companies like Vanguard (the BigThree) consist of up to 20-30% of the total hold of companies from S\u0026P500.\n\nSince the 70s, investors are more and more favoring the (not-so-passive) passive investing and index funds to secure their financial future, as it really does offer a promising future by having great return and low fees, all while requiring no hard work from the investor. By giving the money to companies like Vanguard, they can save all the researching and hard work of 'real investing' and simply eat their 'free lunch', while these index funds are actually active but mindless investing machines that simply make the big companies bigger by pouring more money into them to simply 'track the index'.\n\nIndex fund should work amazingly when most people are not using it, but now we're at a point that the fact that index funds consist of the majority of investing activities is essentially hurting the market and the US economy, since most people are not even paying attention to news and knowledges about investing and the companies they invest in. This also really hurts all the smaller companies as they will not likely to get shared the pie since less and less active investors are in the market searching for the undervalued companies.\n\n\"In a world with exclusively passive investors, capital will get allocated only to the big companies and not necessarily to good, promising, or efficient companies. A gravitational, big-getting-bigger effect would dominate stock-price movements.\"\n\n\"The problem is not just the indexers. It is the public markets they reflect, where more chaos, more speculation, more risk, more innovation, and more competition are desperately needed.\"\n\n---\nlinks: [[教育]]、[[科技]]、[[金融]]、[[投資]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nRef:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/09EmYxkGLxHwjuDUSKhqAE?si=daadf38a75a14b56\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/Potential-identity":{"title":"Potential \u0026 identity","content":"#📝️/🌿 \n\n我很肯定，每一個人都有責任去思考、體認、並發展自己身而為人的價值和潛能。這意味著，只要你相信自己活著是有價值和意義的、或假如你確實需要一份價值和意義，那麼你就不可能避開「哪些事物或信念更值得你為之而活」的問題——這是一個我們必須回答的道德問題。\n\n選擇拒答這個道德問題，代表你還不願意在心中整理出事物的優先次序、不願意將某些事物置於其他事物之前、不願意為自己樹立一個像樣的標靶並做出必要的犧牲（也就是放棄那些你不再可能贖回的機會成本）。結果是，你的漫無目的會體現於你的人格、思考、和生活方式：你做的決定只會是隨波逐流、你獲取的東西只會是慾望滿足、你的言行舉止只會是盲目習慣。\n\n當代思潮下，人們喪失了託付的勇氣，無論那是託付於一段感情、一份專業、或一種堅定的道德觀，因為託付所伴隨的，是責任。反之，人們樂於對一切可能性保持開放、不願意做出艱難抉擇、排斥任何形式的理想和典範、害怕偏袒任何太肯定的價值觀。\n\n逃避責任的結果是：你不會知道你有機會成為、應該成為什麼樣的自己，你不會真正發掘出屬於你的、充滿主動性和創造力的自我，當然也不會找到自己在這世上無可取代的一席之地。\n\n就跟拒絕長大的彼得潘一樣，你將空有一身潛能，卻未將一分潛能化為現實。\n\n(又見[[儒家論人的道德潛能]])\n  \n\n\n小孩子的自我認同：我認為我是誰我就是誰，整個世界都必須認同逢迎我拿來代表自己的包裝標示。\n\n智者的自我認同：我未必是我以為我是的樣子，但我能夠成為這個世界需要我成為的人，甚至更多。\n\n  \n\nPeter pan\n\nValue of limitation and routine\n\nSinglemindedly pursue a path to harvest an useful skill and experience abt yourself\n\nRoutine and limitation forge your identity, skill and character\n\nOne have to let go of all other possibilities to become something, but something is eventually more than nothing but potential\n\nLimitation and boundaries give you a sense of self, only on that basis can you have freedom of time and self expression\n\n---\n幾乎任何一對父母都會相信自己的孩子很特別，但在客觀上、當事上有數以百萬計的孩子時，這顯得是十分不理性的。有人可能會說你因為愛而對自己的孩子目盲，但在一個更深層的意義上，其實我們是因為愛而對世上其他的孩子目盲。為什麼呢？因為我們基於對自己孩子的愛，因此能夠真正「看見」自己孩子的全貌，那個全貌不是他們此刻所是、或者一直以來的樣子，而是他們「能夠」成為的樣子。我們透過愛、看見孩子尚未彰顯的潛能，而這實是當你與他人以愛作為基礎去建立連結時、真正「看見」對方的方式。這絕不是因愛產生的幻覺，而是因愛產生的視野。\n\n當我們與他人建立以愛為基礎的關係時，沒有什麼能夠比將人的情感意念化約為純粹生物學的機械式解釋更令人挫敗的了。這種敘事意圖將人類在道德上的努力抹除、讓一切顯得徒勞無功。\n\n---\nlinks: [[潛能]]、[[意義]]、[[道德]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nRef: \n[[[阿奎那：五路論證]]]\n[[Eugenics Flawed Thinking Behind Pushed Science  Alex Story]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/Standing-the-test-of-time":{"title":"Standing the test of time","content":"#📝️/🌿 #✍🏼/🔴 \n\nLindy effect\n\nRationality is survival - Nassim Taleb\n\nVirtue (alongside religious teaching) helps human survive and thrive across time. Virtue is human's tool to beat our innate time preference. Virtue has to stand the test of time and apply across one's lifespan and generations. Real virtue applies across time and helps men survive.\n\nThis is why the right to tell the truth (free speech) is crucial to men's survival.

We should not blindly assume it'll survive the NEXT technological revolution, but dig in to its **principles for survival** to determine if it'll still survive the next tech change. \n  If a book - be it 2000, 20, or 2 years old - contains knowledge that can be reasonably interpreted and implemented across time, or, can reasonably explain / be used to explain things that happened then and are happening now, we can safely assume it must has grasped some fundamental thinking that will probably continue being useful for explaining the things that're about to happen with the succeeding technological changes. On the contrary, if a newer book suggest the latest things to be good only according to its current face value and does not explain the principles behind the thinking well enough to also explain the things that come before that, it's probably not worth reading because the methodology did not set out to stand the test of time.\n  So this is the reason an old book that's still be printed today should be carefully and humbly read and understood, but without blindly believing it must be applicable for the next upcoming era - it probably might (more so than most other books released this year), but we can never be sure.\n- We can also look at it from a software-update/technological-advancement point of view. \n  We should very careful in identifying the **features** and the **principles** in work in our current time and in the past. It's also crucial to understand how **hardware**, ie state of technology, suspends/prolongs/disables/enables the **software**, ie trending cultural/political/ethical (even) believes, and even updates it or creates new ones.\n  So instead of being completely reactionary, thinking that traditional values/ethics/politcs (ie good ol' days) is better, or even fighting to bring it back (which is probably a universal nostalgia at best), we should strive to think about, pinpoint, and communicate the working principle/philosophy that underly the given time and space (state of technology) and try to extract the principles from the features, so when the next technological advancement comes, we'll have the working principles that allow us to design and promote the new / updated features that'll work in the next state of technology, instead of holding on to the old feature that simply will not work in the next era.\n  So in a real software sense it's like, we should strive to understand why Windows 3.11 works (and works very well) given the state of technology, the design principles behind the its features and functionalities, what it was maximizing/optimizing for / oriented toward, and WHY it might or might not still matter for the next version of Windows. With such understanding, can we safely, knowingly, and confidently move forward to the next version, knowing (not full well, but well enough) how to navigate with the latest state of technology like the advancement of face recognition, AI, wireless connection, touch screens, etc, and orient ourselves toward the right goal so it's totally okay for us to abandon the older OS for the newer, better (in some sense), more suitable (for our state of techology) one.\n\n---\nlinks: [[時間偏好]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nref: [[道德，是群體的跨期福祉問題]]\n[[We Wrestle Not With Flesh and Blood, but Against Powers and Principalities]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-one-argument-and-why-porn-and-suicide-are-wrong":{"title":"The one argument (and why porn and suicide are wrong)","content":"#📝️/🌿  \n\nThe sovereignty of individual is the deepest truth I can currently conceive of and can't reason any deeper. I almost have to take a leap of faith and believe that each one of use is made in the image of God, as it sets the very fundamental for our sovereign existence.\n\nTo be valued both by ourselves and by others, is an undeniable instinct we all share and the basis of how we conduct our lives. We like to live as if we're something of value and we like it when others validate that ideas, and others will find us respectful only when we treat them the same way.\n\nFree will or not, we as humans like to live as if we're conscious agency of our being. We certainly don't like to be devalued as if we're merely objects or means to an end, that's when we'll feel used, taken advantage of, lied to, and betrayed.\n\nAlmost universally, the ideal life we can possibly imagine for ourselves consists of something involving appreciation and care from our family, validation and recognition for our work, cherishment and love from our partners, and affirmation and respect for ourselves. This is the very instinct we live of, and the ideal we live towards.\n\nSo it's undeniable that one of, if not the very thing we want in our life, is to be valued as a human being, in whatever way we individually desire. Being valued as an individual can give us tremendous meaning and help us get through significant amount of hardships, which is why the voluntarily adoption of responsibility is one of the quickest way to cultivate drive and meaning for your life.\n\nThis is why in our daily life, we should not only view ourselves as individuals as values and not accept ourselves to be used (to be enslaved by other's emotions or actions), but should also be wary not to reduce any person's individuality down to his/her look, race, gender, opinion, action, and belief. As tempting as it is to do so, by fighting this lazy and irresponsible attempt to reduce people into less than who they are and dehumanize them, we form a much stronger basis for public discussion, social affair, mutual understanding, genuine and trustful interaction on all levels. This is a moral pillar for a strong and stable society.\n\nSo this leads us to why watching porn is wrong - and I'm mainly talking about the act of watching people have sex for one's own pleasure - is because this act is equivalent to exploiting the performers for one's own usage and reduces them to merely objects for certain means. Watching porn is not wrong because sex and body are sinful, but this the very act we should avoid as it's wrong in and of itself, whether or not the performer likes it or if it's hurting anyone.\n\n透過色情片來理解自身性偏好及性生活的人，會深深地內化「一切都是以我為中心」的訊息，無論看色情片的人怎麼做都沒辦法改變這點。而當他們找到可能成為他們人生伴侶的人時，他們會缺乏正確的觀念去建立起真正的人際關係。- [[Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World]]\n\nAnd so there's no more dangerous idea than what some people might think 'humans as parasites on earth'. Such view might come from the care for the environment as well as the pessimistic view for humanity, but it's nonetheless a catastrophic idea. Such idea is not only not helpful (should we just line people up and shoot them? tell people to quit having children?), but itself degrades the value of the person promoting it, which is why it's catastrophic - it's an idea that can bring demise to the very person withholding it. And that's precisely what many mass shooter did - when one REALLY believes there to be no value in humanity and its existence, the most logical act would be to kill as many people as possible before one commit suicide\n\nThat leads us to suicide. Imagine the ideal life we talked about where your value is appreciated, now consider the opposite direction, where a person is totally not valued. Despite there're many other complex reasons why people lead to suicidal thoughts,\n\n...The very suicide attempt is the doing (direct result) of the circumstances in which the person is not valued, so the only real self-conscious decision in the midst of it would be to stand up and live as if you're a valuable individual. Do not let the whole self destructing circumstance consume you into nothingness, which is what the darkness of this world can sometimes do to people.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JQKZsfy_YdM\n\nKey foundation that pro-life arguments are based on: Value of a living being (human) is based on the potential (human-ness) that one possesses, not on whether one can express that fully at a given moment.\n\nThe same can be said to those with brain damage (or even brain dead) or seriously ill. People will do what they can to hold on to these loved ones in the hope of them being well again - to realize the potential of being a human in this world again. It seems somewhat illogical or cruel to disregard that part of a embryo just because it hasn’t have the chance to prove its capacity of human-ness and establish a relationship with anyone, yet.\n\nHowever, how do we determine which potential is greater? The mother’s potential without carrying this unwanted child, or the potential of both of them living, or even the potential of the child at the expense of sacrificing the mother’s life if needed? In different period of the human history we seemed to have different answers, and I’m not so sure how to answer this one at this moment, and I’m quite certain this answer is unanswerable.\n\nFor the most part I’d still suppot a society with minimal interference of people‘s live from the government and I do not trust governments for achieving greater goods for most citizens (as I do believe in the sovereignty of individual‘s choices) and I do want to stay away from authoritarian regime of most kinds. I’d still propose a free, libertarianism socieity with minimal interference from the governments but with high moral standards of the people - having the shared sense of responsibility of the people goes hand-in-hand with the optimized freedom.\n\n---\nlinks: [[道德]]、[[神聖個人]]、[[個人生活]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]\nRef: \n","lastmodified":"2023-02-18T18:55:19.650689055Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-wrong-measure-for-all-things":{"title":"","content":"tags: #📝️/🌿 \nlinks: [[科技]]、[[金融]]、[[道德]]、[[哲學]]、[[道德]]、[[能源]]、[[]]\nRef: \n[[個人德性的意義與責任]]\n\n---\n\n(How our lives in the 20-21st century can possibly be viewed as a total mistake/detour from the right direction in later centuries when people look back with their re-gained moral knowledge and holistic worldview.) \n\n- Technological thinking\n  ref: [[Daniel Schmachtenberger - Bend Not Break Part 1 Energy Blindness]]\n\tPeople are overly optimistic about technology being able to solve pretty much all the problems we face, in fact technology creates just as many - if not more - problems than it solves.\n\t\n\tPeople are too optimistic about technology for a good reason - technology has indeed been immensely improving for the past few decades, however that's merely based on the fact that we discovered the carbon pulse that fuels pretty much all the globalized technological advancement.\n\t\n\tHowever, being this optimistic about technology really only serves as a placebo, as it seems there's no other way around many of the economical and environmental issue we face, unless all of us voluntarily / involuntarily downsize/de-grow our economy and lifestyle, which is certainly not considered an option for those who already enjoy the technological brilliance they have in their daily lives.
