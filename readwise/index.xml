all of these risks are unsolvablewithout solving the things the patterns of human behavior that give rise to thembut that the patterns of human behaviorthat give rise to them can be namedandcan beprogressively not perfectly butprogressively better addressed and thatin doing sothere is a possibility tocreate a attractor for the world that isnot catastrophes or dystopiasin which we have theresponsibility andwisdom adequate individually and collectively tosteward the powerof the exponential technologythat we are creating ( View Highlight) the exponential power of exponentialtechmakesvia decentralizationcatastrophes more likely ( View Highlight) to be able to bind those catastrophes it has to bind all of them because anyof the catastrophes are enough to breakthe thing down to bind all of themrequires really centralized power ( View Highlight) those arethe two attractorsthat civilizationis currently most likely heading in andwe can see how the solutions to eitherone orient to the other one more ( View Highlight) i would saythat we are seeking a third attractorthat is neither catastrophes ordystopias seems like a pretty fairstarting place for how do we design acivilization that is desirable or at least allows us to continue to advancein the on the meaningful questions whata desirable civilization isum involves being able to avoid the twinattractors of catastrophes and dystopiasand that those two must always be takenin considerationbecause it&amp;rsquo;s very easy for apartial solutionto externalize a problem somewhere else ( View Highlight) we want to be able to holdthe undesirable possibilities that arein relationship to each other at thesame time we want to be able to hold allthe problems at the same time to then beable to say what does a solution looklike it decreases the likelihood for allof those simultaneously ( View Highlight) some of the reallywell intended activismthat did actually succeed in solvingparticular problemsended up unintentionally causing otherproblems in the process ( View Highlight) in so far as youbelieve market ideology thatgdp going up means more products andservices that improve people&amp;rsquo;s qualityof life goes up it seems like a goodideainsofar as you realize that war makesgdp go up andsick people engaging in morehealth expenses does and addiction makesit go up you realize okay and the gdpcorresponds to environmental andsustainabilitygdp is not an adequate metric ( View Highlight) ourapproach to problem solving is actuallyone of the problems one of theunderlying kind of generators is becausewe define the problems in too narrow away ( View Highlight) when we define a problem in anarrow way then we can create a solution to thatnarrow problem that does benefit thatthing but that interacts with a lot ofother things and ends up causingexternalities or harm in those otherareas ( View Highlight) Note: Much like how a super intelligent AI, if given a wrong problem and metrics, will solve that problem in a super efficient, unstoppable manner which also conflicts human values.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness/Readwise/Technology-Is-Not-Values-Neutral-Ending-the-Reign-of-Nihilistic-Design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness/Readwise/Technology-Is-Not-Values-Neutral-Ending-the-Reign-of-Nihilistic-Design/</guid><description>tags: #ðŸ—ƒ/ðŸŸ¥ aliases: ref: https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/
Rather than serving primarily in the background for labor or infrastructure, technological advances are in the immediate foregroundâ€”in the palm of our handsâ€”central to the most intimate and consequential aspects of our lives, including education, communication, relationships, and politics.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness/Readwise/The-End-of-the-Future-With-Peter-Thiel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness/Readwise/The-End-of-the-Future-With-Peter-Thiel/</guid><description>tags: #ðŸ—ƒ/ðŸŸ¥ aliases: ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibR_ULHYirs&amp;list=WL&amp;index=59&amp;ab_channel=StanfordClassicalLiberalismInitiative
