Unknown</p><ul class=tags></ul><p>#📝️/🌿</p><p>I think one of the most important findings  in the last few years in neuroscience is that, while the molecule dopamine is associated with reward, it&rsquo;s more about motivation and craving
There&rsquo;s a really classic experiment now that  people use to demonstrate this take two rats  and the rats independently separate cages can  lever press for food or when they can access food
there&rsquo;s a little bit of dopamine that&rsquo;s released  anytime they get some food so we always thought  that food like many other rewards like food sex  warmth when you&rsquo;re cold cool when you&rsquo;re too warm  is triggering the release of dopamine
but someone  had the good idea to deplete dopamine in one of  those animals and then what you find is that the  animal without dopamine still enjoys food still  enjoys other pleasures
so <strong>dopamine is not really  involved in the enjoyment of those pleasures  it&rsquo;s involved in motivation because if you make  the animal have to move just one rat&rsquo;s length  believe it or not to get to that lever the animal  with dopamine will work to go get that thing it  will work through some effort to go get the reward 
whereas the animal or turns out the human without  much dopamine can still experience pleasure they  can sit on their couch and cram their face with  pleasure inducing calories or what have  you watch pleasure inducing things on the  television but they have very little motivation to  go pursue things that will deliver them pleasure</strong>  
it&rsquo;s actually <strong>what&rsquo;s really driven the forward  evolution of our our species, has been the desire  to go seek things beyond the confines of our  skin.
when i say the common currency is  dopamine, what i mean is the molecule dopamine - when secreted in the brain - makes us pursue things, build things, create things, makes us want new things that we don&rsquo;t currently already have, and so it has a lot of dimensions to it.
but rather than think about dopamine as a signal for reward - like a dopamine hit we classically think and talk about - it&rsquo;s more accurate to think about dopamine as driving motivation and craving to go seek rewards</strong>
<strong>and  it&rsquo;s a way of tabulating where we are in our life</strong>  are we doing well or are we doing poorly and that  happens on very short time scales like you wake up  feeling good or do you wake up feeling kind of low  
or on long time scales if you&rsquo;re halfway through  a long degree or you&rsquo;re halfway through your life  how are you doing how do you gauge that well it  has everything to do with how much dopamine you  were releasing in the previous days and weeks and  years
so you&rsquo;re always comparing and all of this  is subconscious
but what&rsquo;s cool is that <strong>once you  make these processes conscious once you understand  a little bit about how dopamine is released and  how it changes our perspective and our behavior  then you can actually work with it</strong> and
so  we go back to this example the person that&rsquo;s  not motivated that can&rsquo;t get off the couch  that doesn&rsquo;t want to do anything well this  is the problem
they are effectively the rat  with no dopamine but they can still achieve  some sense of pleasure by consuming excess  calories by consuming social media and
look i&rsquo;m  not judging i do this stuff too right scrolling  social media
if you&rsquo;ve ever scrolled social media  and you&rsquo;re like i don&rsquo;t even know why i&rsquo;m  doing this it doesn&rsquo;t really feel that good  
and i can remember a time where you&rsquo;d  see something it was just so cool or you  see something online i remember this when ted  talks first came out i was like this is amazing  these are some at least some of them are really  smart people sharing really cool insights  and then now that they&rsquo;re like a gazillion ted  talks
i remember spending a winter in my office at  when i was a junior professor cleaning my office  finally and binging ted talks in the background  thinking this is a good use of my time pretty soon  they all sucked to me i was like this isn&rsquo;t good 
so what you need to do is stop watching Ted talks for a while, wait and then they become interesting  again and that&rsquo;s this pain pleasure balance
and 
so for people that aren&rsquo;t feeling motivated, the problem is they&rsquo;re not motivated. but they&rsquo;re getting just enough or excess sustenance, so they&rsquo;re getting the little mild hits of opioid - it becomes an opioid system.
if you think  about the opioid drugs as opposed to dopamine / dopaminergic drugs,
dopaminergic drugs make people rabid for everything: drugs of abuse like cocaine, amphetamine make people incredibly outward directed, or they hardly notice anything except what they want more of - one more, more. it&rsquo;s  very bad because those drugs trigger so much  dopamine release that they become the reward - it&rsquo;s  very circular. the only the drug can give that  much dopamine, nothing they could pursue would  give them as much dopamine as the drug itself. so  there&rsquo;s that.</p><p>and then there&rsquo;s the kind of opioid like effects of constantly indulging oneself with social media or with video games or with with food or with anything to the point where it no longer evokes the motivation and craving.</p><p>and <strong>this is really the new evolution of the understanding of dopamine in neuro in neuroscience, which is that dopamine itself is not the reward, it&rsquo;s the build up to the reward. and the reward has more of a kind of opioid bliss-like property which itself is not bad if it&rsquo;s endogenous released from within.
but when we can just sit there - like the rat with no dopamine - gorging ourselves with pleasures, so to speak, what you end up with is somebody that feels really unmotivated and those pleasures no longer work to tickle those feel good circuits and so there&rsquo;s no reason for them to go out and pursue anything.</strong>
<strong>the problem is not pleasures, the problem is that pleasure experienced without prior requirement for pursuit is terrible for us.</strong>
it&rsquo;s terrible  for us as individuals, it&rsquo;s terrible for us as as  groups, and i have great confidence in the human  species to work this out</p><p>but <strong>we are finding  now and we are going to increasingly find, that those who will be successful - young or old - are going to be those people who can create their  own internal buffers.</strong>
<strong>they&rsquo;re going to be able to  control their relationship to pleasures because  the proximity to pleasures and the availability  is the problem.</strong></p><p>if you look at the increase in use of drug abuse or prescription medication, which at least at the first pass deliver pleasure / pain relief. the whole issue with the opioid crisis and dopaminergic drugs like ritalin adderall - sometimes there&rsquo;s a clinical need - is that tons of people are taking those recreationally  now or to study huge dopamine increases are what  those cause
that is a problem that&rsquo;s a serious  problem because it creates a cycle where you you  need more of that specific thing
i always say  <strong>addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure</strong>
i don&rsquo;t  like to comment too much on enlightenment because  you know i don&rsquo;t really know what that is as a  neurobiologist but
<strong>a good life - we could say - is a progressive expansion of the things that bring  you pleasure and even better is a good life is a  progressive expansion of the things that bring you  pleasure and includes pleasure through motivation  and hard work</strong>
<strong>and understanding this pain-pleasure  balance, whereby if you experience pain and you can  continue to be in that friction and exert effort, the rewards are that much greater when they arrive</strong>  
and so i think that if you look at any drug  of abuse or any situation where somebody  isn&rsquo;t motivated or thinks that now they may  have clinically diagnosed attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder
but a lot of what people  think is adhd it turns out is people just over  consuming dopamine from various sources and then  and also the context within a tick-tock feed is  the context switch is insane
the brain has never  seen first of all there&rsquo;s the first time in human  evolution that we wrote with our thumbs but that&rsquo;s  a pretty benign shift
and that the other shift is  normally you walk from one room to another or from  a field into the trees or from a hut into or a  house or whatever it is
but now you can get 10 000  context switches in that 30 minutes of scrolling  on instagram or to talk
and <strong>so it&rsquo;s all about  self-regulation - we are going to select for the  people that can self-regulate</strong>
and so then people  say well how do you self-regulate how do kids  self-regulate well this is my hope
and one of the  reasons i&rsquo;ve gotten excited about public education  and teaching neuroscience is that
this is a place  where knowledge of knowledge actually can allow  oneself to intervene
when you think i&rsquo;m feeling  low i don&rsquo;t feel good nothing really feels like  am i depressed maybe
but maybe you&rsquo;re just you&rsquo;ve  saturated the dopamine circuits you&rsquo;re now in the  pain part of things
what do you do well you have  to stop you need you need to replenish dopamine  you need to stop engaging with this behavior  and then your pleasure for it will come back  but you have to constantly control the hinge
it&rsquo;s  not just about being back and forth on the seesaw  you have to make sure the hinge doesn&rsquo;t get stuck  in pain or in pleasure
understanding that pain  and pleasure in this really dynamic balance  can also help us which in the following way  
any pain that you feel the longer day the less  sleep the the kind of agony that things aren&rsquo;t  working that power outlet doesn&rsquo;t work  or the internet is slow whatever it is  
<strong>the amount of pleasure that you will eventually  experience is directly relation related  to how much pain you experience</strong>
so we know this  from actually what nowadays would be considered  quite barbaric and unethical experiments  where they would give people electrical shocks  and they would measure their response and then  they&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re going to increase it we&rsquo;re  going to increase it
eventually they get to the  point where a slight shock that was previously  very painful actually evokes a sense of pleasure  now you couldn&rsquo;t do these experiments anymore  these are not the experiments i do in my lab and  these are older experiments
but for instance i  and this has been discussed in scientific research  papers uh giving somebody a like a ten minute ice  bath for instance or even a three-minute ice bath  or a one-minute ice bath it&rsquo;s quite painful
but  there was a study from the university of prague  uh european journal <strong>physiology showed that  after a painful ice bath stimulus the amount of  dopamine release goes up for two and a half hours  to 250 percent above baseline
and that&rsquo;s not  because the ice bath itself evokes dopamine  release</strong> - a lot of people think oh cold water of ox  dopamine release no -
<strong>pain evokes dopamine release  after the pain is over</strong></p><p>just understanding <strong>the more  friction and pain that you experience the greater  the dopamine reward you will get later and that  serves as its own amplifier of the whole process  of pursuing more dopamine</strong></p><p>**so the keys are to  pursue rewards but understand that the pursuit is actually the reward if you want to have repeated wins.</p><p><strong>then what you realize is your capacity to tap into dopamine as a motivator not  just seeking dopamine rewards that is infinite</strong></p><p>養大了一整個世代沒有暴露在風險之下、沒有能力駕馭這些事情的孩子，在社會層面上是個尤其悲劇的事。 - <a class="internal-link broken">Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World</a></p><p>讓我們從 耶穌意思的反面 開始。 許多人認為"十字架"是他們生活中必須 背負 的 重擔： 一段緊張的關係，一份吃力不討好的工作，一種身體上的疾病。 因著自憐的驕傲，他們說，&ldquo;那是我必須背負的十字架。&ldquo;這樣的解釋並不是耶穌所說的&rdquo; 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我&rdquo;。</p><p>當耶穌 背 著他的十字架 到各各他被釘死十架時， 沒有人想到十字架是 所背負重擔 的象徵。 對於一個 一 世紀的人來說，十字架意味著一件事 且只有一件事： 人類 可以發明的 最痛苦和最丟人的 死亡方式 。</p><p>兩千年後，基督徒將十字架視為贖罪、 饒恕 、恩典和愛的象徵。 但在耶穌的 時代 裡，十字架代表的 只有 痛苦的死亡。 因為羅馬人 強制 被定罪的罪犯將自己的十字架 背 到受難地，背十字架意味著他們 背著自己的刑具同時要面對死亡道路上的嘲笑。</p><p>因此，" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我"意味著 為了 跟隨耶穌願意 去 死 。 這叫做" 向自己死 &ldquo;。 這是對絕對 順服的呼召 。 耶穌囑咐 背起十架之後， 他說 ： &ldquo;因為凡要救自己生命的 ， 必喪掉生命 ； 凡為我喪掉生命的 ， 必救了生命。人若賺得全世界 ， 卻喪了自己 ， 賠上自己 ， 有什麼益處呢？ " ( 路加福音 9:24-25; 馬太福音 16:26; 馬可福音 8:35-36) 。 儘管這 個呼召 很困難，但 回報 卻是無與倫比的。</p><p>無論耶穌去哪裡，他都吸引眾人。 儘管這些人常常 將他 作為彌賽亞 來 跟隨他， 但是 他們對彌賽亞真正的看法——他將會做什麼 —— 被 扭曲了。 他們認為基督 會開闢復興的國度。 他們 認為 他會把他們從羅馬占領者的壓迫 中 解放出來。 甚至基督自己門徒的內部圈子也認為這個王國即將來臨 ( 路加福音 19:11) 。 當耶穌開始教導他將死於猶太領袖和非猶太人 的君主 ( 路加福音9:22) 時，他的聲望就下降了。 許多被震驚的 跟 隨者都拒絕了他。 的確，他們不能 消滅 自己的想法、計劃和願望 ， 而用耶穌的來代替。</p><p>當生活順利的時候，跟隨耶穌是很容易的 ； 我們對他的真正承諾是在 試煉 過程中顯露出來的。 耶穌向我們 明確，試煉 將會臨到他的 跟 隨者 ( 約翰福音 16:33) 。 門徒需要犧牲， 並且 耶穌從來沒有隱瞞過 這一代價 。</p><p>在路加福音 9:57-62 ，有三個人似乎願意跟隨耶穌。 當耶穌進一步追問他們時，他們的承諾充其量只是半心半意。 他們沒能計算出 跟隨他的代價 。 沒有人願意 背起 他的十字架，把自己的利益釘在十字架上。</p><p>因此，耶穌似乎勸阻了他們。 這是多麼 不同於典型的福音 傳道！ 有多少人會對一個叫做&rdquo; 來 跟隨耶穌，你可能會 面臨 失去朋友 、 家人 、 名聲、 事業，甚至是你的生命&rdquo; 這樣 的 獻祭 做出回應呢？ 虛假轉變之人 的數量可能會減少。 這就是耶穌所說的" 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我。"</p><p>如果你想知道你是否準備好 背起 你的十字架，考慮以下問題 :<br>&ldquo;如果 它意味著 你 會 失去一些最親密的朋友，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ "<br>&ldquo;如果 它 意味著疏遠你的家 人 ，你願意 跟 隨耶穌嗎？ "<br>&ldquo;如果 它 意味著你的名譽受損，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ "<br>&ldquo;如果 它 意味著你 將 失去工作，你願意跟隨耶穌嗎？ "<br>&ldquo;如果 它 意味著失去你的生命 ， 你願意 跟 隨耶穌嗎？ "</p><p>在世界的某些地方，這些後果是 事實 。 但請注意這些問題的措辭，&ldquo;你願意嗎？ &ldquo;跟隨耶穌並不一定意味著所有這些事情都會發生在你身上，但是你願意 背起 你的十字架嗎？ 如果在你的生活中，你 將 面臨著一個選擇——耶穌或 今生 的舒適——你會選擇哪一個？</p><p>對基督承諾意味著每天 背起 你的十字架，放棄你的希望 、 夢想 、 財產，為了基督的緣故如果需要的話 ， 甚至是你的生命。 只有當你願意 背起 你的十字架時，你才可以 稱為 他的門徒 ( 路加福音 14:27) 。 回報值得 這一代價 。 耶穌 緊跟他向自己死的呼召 ( " 背起 你的十字架 來 跟從我&rdquo; ) 之後 ， 是 在基督裡 獲得 生命 ： &ldquo;凡 要 救自己生命的，必喪掉生命 ； 凡為我喪掉生命的，必 得著 生命&rdquo; ( 馬太福音 16:25) 。</p><hr><p>links: <a class="internal-link broken">哲學</a>、<a class="internal-link broken">基督教</a>、<a class="internal-link broken">神經科學</a>、<a class="internal-link broken">意義</a>、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]、[[]]
