However with the possibility of a &rsquo;network state&rsquo; enabled by Web 3.0, the effort to bomb someone will be greatly reduced, because in order to bomb someone to gain advantage, you not only need to own the weapon, know how to send it to the correct destination, and also need to bomb the right person. Web 3.0 and encryption-driven networks will make it impossible to finish that last step: to bomb the right location because in Web 3.0, the important infrastructures are widely distributed and decentralized. There&rsquo;s simply no specific one thing/person to bomb to make it worth it.</li></ul></li><li>taking unrenewableresources and turning it intounprocessable wastebrings us to all these differentplanetary tipping points (
