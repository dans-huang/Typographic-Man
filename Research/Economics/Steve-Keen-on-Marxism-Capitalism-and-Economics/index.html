understand 02:00how human civilization comes about and how it can be maintained and that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s been at all so we have a discipline which has the right name and the wrong soul</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>what is the soul of economics the soul of economics really is to explain how do we manage to build a civilization that elevates us so far above the energy and consumption and knowledge levels of the base environment of the earth 02:30because if you think about and this is actually working from work i&rsquo;ve learned from tim garrett who&rsquo;s one of my research colleagues as an atmospheric physicist and his idea is that we have these we exploit these high-grade energy sources from the sun itself to coal nuclear et cetera et cetera which means we can maintain a level of human civilization well above what we&rsquo;d have if we&rsquo;re just still running around with rocks and stones and spears so it&rsquo;s that elevation above the base level of the planet which is human 03:00civilization and if we didn&rsquo;t have this energy we were exploiting if we didn&rsquo;t use the environment to elevate ourselves above what&rsquo;s possible in the background then you and i wouldn&rsquo;t be talking into microphones you know yeah we might be doing drum beats and stuff like this but we wouldn&rsquo;t be having the sort of conversation we have so it explained how they came about that what&rsquo;s the economics should be doing and it&rsquo;s not</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>we&rsquo;re the most elaborate construction on the planet and like 03:30that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;ve done we&rsquo;ve denigrated the planet itself we don&rsquo;t have respect for the fact that life itself is an incredible creation and i i my ultimate if i had to see how humanity is going to survive what we&rsquo;re putting ourselves through then it would we&rsquo;d have to come out of it as a species which sees its role as preserving and respecting life</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>life is incredible and when humans don&rsquo;t respect it enough we trash it and and that&rsquo;s what economics i think has played a huge role in that so i actually regard my discipline i would never call it a profession let alone a science uh my discipline has probably helped bring about the termination potential the feasible termination of human civilization</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>practically speaking what are the goals of economics well in terms of the tools we use we should be using the tools that engineers use frankly and that&rsquo;s which sounds ridiculously simple because you would expect that economists are using 05:00up-to-date techniques that are common in other sciences where you&rsquo;re dealing with similar ideas of stocks and flows and interactions between the environment and a system and so on and that&rsquo;s fundamentally systems engineering and that&rsquo;s what we should be using as the tools of economics</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>i actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago 09:30that&rsquo;s where i&rsquo;d like to start from and they&rsquo;re called the physiocrats and the name itself implies where their knowledge came from because if you go back far enough in history we didn&rsquo;t we didn&rsquo;t do autopsies but when you started doing autopsies they found wires they found tubes etc etc and they started seeing the body as a circulation system and they applied the same sort of logic to the economy and they became out of an agricultural economy which was france and they saw that the wealth came 10:00effectively from the sun so they saw all wealth comes from they said the soil but what they really mean is sun the soil absorbs the energy of the sun one seed plants a thousand flu seeds come back there is no surplus uh we are simply mining what we can find out of the natural economy that&rsquo;s where we should have stayed and developed from that forward</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>we then went through the classical school of economics which comes out of adam smith and smith uh coming from scotland looked at what the physiocrats said and 10:30what the physiocrats argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth and the manufacturing sector is sterile that&rsquo;s literally the term they use to describe the manufacturing what is their own means sterile means you don&rsquo;t you don&rsquo;t extract value you simply change the shape of value so the the value comes from the soil the only comes from the soil that&rsquo;s the free gift of nature that&rsquo;s literally the phrase they used and we then distribute the free gifts of nature around and we need carriages which was the manufacturing term they 11:00used at the time as well as wheat so we to make the carriages we take what&rsquo;s been taken from the soil and we convert it to a different form but there is no value added in manufacturing so smith looked at that and said well i&rsquo;m from scotland and we&rsquo;ve got these you know industries you know we make stuff and it&rsquo;s machinery and he said no it&rsquo;s not land that gives it the source of value it&rsquo;s labor yeah now that led to the classical school of thought and that said that all 11:30value comes from labor uh that value is uh is objective so it&rsquo;s the amount of effort you put in that the price two things will exchange for reflects the relative effort that&rsquo;s involved in the manufacturing so this computer takes two hours to make and this bottle takes two minutes to make then there&rsquo;s this is worth 60 times as much as that okay they didn&rsquo;t talk about marginal cost it was absolute cost effectively they didn&rsquo;t talk about utility as a subjective thing they ridiculed subjective utility theory</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>marx then turned that classical school which was pro-capitalism and anti-feudal into a critique of capitalism which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a defense of capitalism 12:30but they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value so that value does not reflect effort it&rsquo;s the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that determines their value marginal utility it&rsquo;s the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility and the concepts of equilibrium and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical school and that&rsquo;s still the 13:00dominant school now 150 years later</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>austrian economics grew out of the new 20:00out of the rebellion against the classical school so you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back in the 1870s as william jevens from england uh menger who&rsquo;s from austria and vol ras from france and volras tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multi-con a multi-product economy where there&rsquo;s numerous producers and numerous consumers everybody&rsquo;s both a producer 20:30and a consumer and you try to work out a vector of prices that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously and that&rsquo;s his equilibrium orientation jevons is also on about equilibrium but he worked more at the aggregate level so there&rsquo;s a supply curve in a demand curve and that&rsquo;s what gabe marshall ultimately codified menger was pretty much saying that well yes there might be an equilibrium but you&rsquo;re going to get disturbed from it all the time you&rsquo;ll be above or below the equilibrium and what came out of the austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that the market 21:00should reach equilibrium but then said well you&rsquo;ll get disturbed away from the equilibrium and it&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s what gives you the vitality of capitalism because an entrepreneur will see an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap and that will give you innovation over time and schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that entrepreneur an entrepreneur is somebody with a great idea and no money yeah okay so to become a capitalist you&rsquo;ve got to get money and therefore you&rsquo;ve got to approach the finance 21:30sector to get the money and the finance sector creates money and also creates a debt for the entrepreneur and so you get this financial engine turning up as well and you will get movements away from equilibrium out of that you won&rsquo;t necessarily head back towards the equilibrium so schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role in which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time and that is really i think a much closer 22:00vision of actual capitalism than anything by even even the the industry-leading austrians you know hayek uh et cetera et cetera they they and certainly ron barto i find totally like reading a cardboard cutout version of uh of the wealth of the wealth of nations it&rsquo;s uh i find his worth trivial um but sean peter was rich but with the same foundations as the austrians but because he talked about the importance of money that took him away from the 22:30austrian vision which is very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism beta said you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs and that&rsquo;s a very important vision</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ean payton gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector and that&rsquo;s fundamentally the world in which we live</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>money fundamentally is not a commodity it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s a claim on somebody else that&rsquo;s money&rsquo;s essence so when you do it you 25:30must use double entry bookkeeping to do it and then when you do you find all the answers that come out of thinking as money as a commodity you&rsquo;re wrong so for example i&rsquo;ve got elon on this one so i want to get this rid of elon because i saw him making a comment about this a few weeks ago on twitter he said that it&rsquo;s wrong for the government effectively it seems wrong for the government to always be in deficit okay now when you look at it and say well how is money created how does money come about when it&rsquo;s not a commodity like gold would you dig up out of the ground when it&rsquo;s actually 26:00social relations between people that create money well money is the fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector when you if we make a transfer between us your deposit account goes down my deposit account goes up those are exchanges on the liability side of the banking of the of the banking sector but if we have a transaction with a bank uh then if the bank lends us money it&rsquo;s as its loans go up its deposits go up 26:30again that same balance so you&rsquo;ve got to look and say money therefore is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector so how do you create create additional liabilities you must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side and the asset side of the banking sector so if you and i make a transaction no money is created money existing money is redistributed but if you go to a bank and by taking out a bank loan then money is created by the bank loan so the liabilities of the banking sector rise the assets rise 27:00they&rsquo;re balanced but more liabilities means for the banking sector means more money okay so that&rsquo;s what that&rsquo;s how private banks create money</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>if the government runs a deficit it spends more money on the individuals in the economy than it taxes them which means their bank accounts increase so a 27:30government deficit creates money for the private sector okay so that&rsquo;s where money creation occurs from the government so it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s it puts money in people&rsquo;s it puts more money into people&rsquo;s bank accounts by spending by welfare payments than it takes out by taxation so that&rsquo;s creating new money and then on the other side on the bank the money turns up in the reserve accounts of the banks which are basically the private bank&rsquo;s bank accounts at the central bank 28:00so rather than the asset of private money creation being loans the asset of government money creation is reserves</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>money creation is a good thing because money creation is what allows commerce to happen</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>if you imagine um your assets minus your liabilities as your equity and your asset is somebody else&rsquo;s liability and your liability is somebody else&rsquo;s asset when we&rsquo;re talking about financial assets and this is another mind-blowing thing that i&rsquo;ve just recently solved myself so the sum total of all financial assets 29:30and liabilities is zero</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>you&rsquo;d have a bank account and you&rsquo;d have some cash yeah okay those are your assets but the bank account is a liability of the banking sector and the cash is the liability of the federal reserve okay so what what&rsquo;s money well money is money money is the promise of a third 31:00party that we both accept to close our transaction</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy so i said in a in a barter economy what we do is you know i&rsquo;ll give you two of these for one of those yeah okay barter just would working at a relative price there are two of us involved and there are two commodities so with money money is a triangular transaction okay 32:00there is one commodity i want to buy that can of drink off you uh two people and the price that&rsquo;s worked out ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay the bank that the buyer has to the promises pay the bank that the seller has so if i we so what you have is a monetary transaction in a capitalist economy involves three agents the buyer the seller and the bank so the bank always has to be part of it well the 32:30bank has to be part of it what when when i hand you the money you accept that as uh you&rsquo;ve now got rather than it&rsquo;s the bank promising to pay me something it&rsquo;s another bank promising to pay you something and we exchange the promises of banks and that&rsquo;s fundamentally money</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>what he does talk about is foreground and background intention and his idea of a dialectic is that there is a unity will exist in society and that unity can be an individual it can be a commodity anything at all 39:00the unity will be understood by that society one particular aspect will be focused upon so if you think about the human being in capitalism the focus on the human being as an object is their capacity to work you&rsquo;re a worker okay that&rsquo;s put in the foreground the fact that you&rsquo;re human and you want to play a guitar and go surfing and make love and all the other things that humans do is pushed into the background there&rsquo;s a tension between the two of those 39:30and that can transform that unity over time and that&rsquo;s a beautiful dynamic vision of change so dialectics is a philosophy of change</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>if you take a human in a any preview it could go back to cro-magnon days when we&rsquo;re you know living in caves and yep and we&rsquo;ve got to go hunting and cook food and stuff like that but there&rsquo;s no social hierarchy as we&rsquo;ve become used to so you don&rsquo;t get labored as a worker or a capitalist you&rsquo;re just a human in that situation then you&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;ve got more of an integrated view of who you are and i think that&rsquo;s one of the appeals of a tribal a genuine tribal culture that 40:30you get treated for the whole of who you are you&rsquo;ve certainly categorized you&rsquo;re male you&rsquo;re female you&rsquo;re young you&rsquo;re old you&rsquo;re a hunter you&rsquo;re a you&rsquo;re a tool maker etc etc but you&rsquo;re treated as more an integrated object when you get put in a complex society like a capitalist society then one side of you is emphasized and the others are de-emphasized</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>is it fair to say that the background is like our basic fundamental humanity and the foreground is the machine of capitalism effectively</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>what marx did 41:00is apply this to a commodity he said what is the essential unity in a capitalist economy and the essential unity is a commodity</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>unity an object in society okay okay so he started from the point of view of trying to understand what how exchange occurs how do we set prices and his starting vision was to say that a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the part of the unity 41:30that we focus upon is the its exchange value a capitalist produces a commodity not because of its qualitative characteristics but because it be sold for a profit so the foreground aspect of a commodity is its exchange value the background aspect of it it won&rsquo;t succeed as a commodity unless it has a use value</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>in a feudal society the commodity what&rsquo;s focused upon is the utility and the cost of production when you&rsquo;re when you&rsquo;re the emperor is immaterial capitalism reverses that so the commodity in a capitalist economy 43:30is a plastic two dollar scratcher you can get from kmart or target yeah and so the the use value is necessary but irrelevant to forming the price</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the argument in the neoclassical theory is that the price ratio the price will when there&rsquo;s an exchange going on there&rsquo;s two person two commodity exchange of two commodities for between two people uh they will cha the the price will change until such time as the ratio of the marginal utilities is equal to the ratio of the marginal costs that&rsquo;s supposed to be the equilibrium</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>now mark says that&rsquo;s [Â __Â ] that&rsquo;s a previous society where you exchange 44:30stuff that you happen to have for stuff somebody else happened to have without any real production mechanism being involved and he said that&rsquo;s like when you when you have an eight two ancient trial or two tribes meeting for the very first time and one tribe can make something the other tribe can&rsquo;t make and they will therefore the price they were willing to pay will reflect how unique this other object is that the this one tribe can make and the other can&rsquo;t so for example the story of manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads it&rsquo;s actually 40 glass trading beads i 45:00do believe it is a true story but the thing is the indians couldn&rsquo;t make glass beads so they value the glass beads of the island of manhattan okay which is a utility-based comparison what mark said that&rsquo;s the very initial contact over time even if you don&rsquo;t know the technology over time you you start to realize how much work goes involved to making what they&rsquo;re selling you versus what you&rsquo;re selling to them and you start making stuff specifically for sale</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the utility plays no role in setting price in marx&rsquo;s model whereas it&rsquo;s essential in the neoclassical model</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>utility itself has different meanings in the two schools of thought if you take the classical school of thought which when marx comes from utility is effectively objective so the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it okay not how comfortable it makes you feel yeah okay now if you think about the utility of the chairs we&rsquo;re both sitting and they&rsquo;re identical from a classical point of view we&rsquo;re both sitting okay 46:30but from the neoclassical point of view it&rsquo;s how comfortable it makes you feel and that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort you might be far more comfortable in the identical chair that i&rsquo;m sitting in then i am yeah and therefore the comparison is difficult and therefore working out a ratio involves you&rsquo;ve got a decline in your each time you give away a chair in exchange for a iphone you have a fall in your utility okay but and then therefore you want a higher return because you&rsquo;re losing more 47:00utility each time the more chairs you give away the less utility you&rsquo;re getting from chairs so there&rsquo;s a decline in your utility that&rsquo;s your your marginal utility so it&rsquo;s including your subjective valuation in setting the price and what mark&rsquo;s pointed out is this is a caricature of actual change in the capitalist economy because we have in a capitalist economy huge factories turning out huge quantities specifically for sale they&rsquo;ve got no utility to the um seller unless they&rsquo;re sold</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>it&rsquo;s a very different vision of where how prices said and marx used that to explain where profit comes from but he made a mistake and his argument was that talking about a worker uh as an ally or unity this foreground background tension thing the foreground is that you hire a worker for their cost of production and their cost of production is a subsistence wage okay 48:00the utility to the buyer is the fact that they can work in a factory now it might take six hours let&rsquo;s say to make the means of subsistence and that&rsquo;s the exchange value and that&rsquo;s what the capitalist pays as a wage to the worker but they can work in the factory for 12 hours that&rsquo;s the utility 12-6 is six surplus of value hours and that&rsquo;s where profit comes from and that was marx&rsquo;s argument and i thought it was brilliant but it also applied to machinery</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the essential unity in a capitalist economy is the commodity a commodity has two characteristics exchange value and use value okay exchange value of a commodity in a capitalist economy will be its cost of production the use value is what you do with it okay once you&rsquo;ve purchased it</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the basic idea starts from the commodities the fundamental unity and capitalism the important commodity in marx&rsquo;s thinking was the worker because that&rsquo;s where he said profit came from yeah okay and then that explains the motivation of the capitalist and that ultimately sort of labor theory of value and marx&rsquo;s arguments about how capitalism will come to an end</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the labor is the only commodity 55:00with both what he called commodity and commodity power</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the commodity is you can buy labor which is the means of subsistence labor power is the capacity to work inside a factory there&rsquo;s a difference between the two therefore that difference will give rise to surplus and there&rsquo;s no other 55:30commodity that has this incidence of commodity and commodity power so that was his exclusivest argument</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the use value exchange value argument can be applied to a machine what&rsquo;s the exchange value of a machine it&rsquo;s cost of manufacturing what&rsquo;s its use value its capacity to produce goods for sale no relation between the two there&rsquo;ll be 58:00a gap a machine can be a source of profit</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the use value significantly greater than its exchange value i.e that the contribution of the machine to production exceeds its depreciation and that was an insight which undermined his explanation for revolution</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the exchange value of the commodity sets its price the use value is independent he called them incommensurable he literally would use the word incommensurability between exchange value and a use value whereas neoclassicals make them commensurable so saying exchange value and use value in incommensurable and that normally means that exchange value is objective like the number of hours it takes to make something useful is subjective how comfortable the chair is the fact you can sit in a chair so that&rsquo;s incommensurability but when you apply it in production the exchange value of something is objective it&rsquo;s how many hours it takes to make a machine or how many hours it takes to make the means of subsistence for a worker the use value is also objective you&rsquo;re making commodities for sale and the worker does six hours six hours of work will make them the means of subsistence for the worker but the worker will work a 12-hour day and the six hours becomes a gap now that&rsquo;s incommensurability between use value and exchange value of labor</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>in my modern reinterpretation of marx which brings in my work on energy i see both labor and machinery as a means to harness energy and produce useful work and they can both do that in fact they do it together it&rsquo;s a collective enterprise</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>there&rsquo;s no fundamental difference from exchange value and use value perspective between a human and a machine and therefore they&rsquo;re using the same logic they can both be a source of surplus yeah which is what marx contradicted because his explanation for where socialism would come from is that only profit comes from late profit comes only from labor over time will add more machinery than labor that will mean a falling rate of profit and therefore a tendency towards socialism and what he did in that insight in 1857 is contradict his own idea about what would lead to socialism and he couldn&rsquo;t cope with it</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the real foundation of marxist political philosophy was the economic argument that there would be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall and that tendency for the rate of profit of fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder paying them less than their subsistence uh i&rsquo;ll revolt by workers against this and then you would get socialism on the other side</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>strictly speaking what socialism meant is the public ownership of the means of production no private ownership for the means of production</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>that&rsquo;s the outcome you actually want the best possible world you&rsquo;re trying to build as fast as possible you&rsquo;re paying workers as high wages as you possibly can and that leads to a world where you don&rsquo;t innovate you said capitalism on the other hand pure capitalist economy you&rsquo;re trying to pay workers as little as possible you have competitive industries you&rsquo;re trying to take demand away from your rivals you have kawasaki versus honda versus you know bmw etc etc the way you get demand away from your competitors is by innovating so what you will get is cycles and booms and slumps but you&rsquo;ll innovate and change over time so what you found was this huge gap between socialist volume production with no innovation and capitalism with innovation so that was the fundamental failing</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the essence of capitalism is what you can make in a factory and therefore for these unique objects these rare objects and the picasso painting uh you know a beautiful bottle of wine etc etc then the utility it can&rsquo;t be reproduced easily so its price will be determined by subjective valuation you said what we&rsquo;re talking about in capitalism is the stuff you can make on mass okay and that that that is the true focus of the capitalist economy and that is not about scarcity that is about you the only scarcity applies when you don&rsquo;t have the resources to make them anymore or you can&rsquo;t use the energy involved because you&rsquo;ll damage the biosphere with too much which we&rsquo;ve already done okay but fundamentally the scarcity that neoclassicals have made us think about and austrians think about as well is non-reproducible but the essence of capitalism is the commodity the back scratcher the two buck back scratcher anybody can you know the cheapest chips to make and that&rsquo;s why you can make a profit out of them um not not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies that only the king gets so we think our vision of scarcity has been perverted by neoclassicals analyzing the exception to capitalism and calling it capitalism</p></blockquote></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks
