This number could be referenced from any other card, because it would never change. The branches created “strands” of thought that one could enter at any point, following it downstream to be elaborated upon or upstream to its source. (

There is no hierarchy in the zettelkasten, which means it can grow internally without any preconceived scheme. By creating notes as a decentralized network instead of a hierarchical tree, Luhmann anticipated hypertext and URLs. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa74epyjtfj78shj7ks7xb rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Luhmann often remarked that he never forced himself to do anything he didn’t feel like doing: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f). (

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaankbbry0kqc6shetygwb rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Writing works well in improving one’s thinking because it forces you to engage with what you’re reading on a deeper level. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqab7pgn488s8fmnqrkf7k0 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Principle #2: Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqac48cmwsca1k141d5t21d rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>“there is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.” (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqactqcr87kjgk24b1mn47a rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>The purpose of research is to produce <em>public</em> knowledge that can be scrutinized and tested. For that to happen, it has to be written down. And once it is, what the author meant doesn’t matter – only the actual words written on the page matter. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqadasr986zh7bhcypfbk0b rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>This principle requires us to expand our definition of “publication” beyond the usual narrow sense. Few people will ever publish their work in an academic journal or even on a blog. But everything that we write down and share with someone else counts: notes we share with a friend, homework we submit to a professor, emails we write to our colleagues, and presentations we deliver to clients all count as knowledge made public.

You’ll be more focused, more curious, more rigorous, and more demanding. You won’t waste time writing down every detail, trying to make a perfect record of everything that was said. Instead, you’ll try to learn the basics as efficiently as possible so you can get to the point where open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqafaghrrp1n15x8bk9ty0g rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Almost every aspect of your life will change when you live as if you are working toward publication. (

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqagwv2k6etbs5qt4qd1zqv rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>No one ever really starts from scratch. Anything they come up with has to come from prior experience, research, or other understanding. But because they haven’t acted on this fact, they can’t track ideas back to their origins. They have neither supporting material nor accurate sources. Since they haven’t been taking notes from the start, they either have to start with something completely new (which is risky) or retrace their steps (which is boring). (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqangmv60kzmpc64dth2yqy rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Principle #4: Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaqttfpmw69hrdqk9rf6ee rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>It is only when all the work becomes part of an integrated process that it becomes more than the sum of its parts. Even the best techniques won’t make a difference if they are used in conflicting ways. This is why the slip-box isn’t yet another technique. It is the system in which all the techniques are linked together. (

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqb152btdnc9v5rtqxp44mt rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Principle #8: Organize your notes by context, not by topic (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqbtcby6kr33gy74j5w2wer rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>The classic mistake is to organize them into ever more specific topics and subtopics. This makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes overwhelming. The more notes pile up, the smaller and narrower the subtopics become, limiting your ability to see meaningful connections between them. With this approach, the greater one’s collection of notes, the less accessible and useful they become. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc219hmj40j3ppwwq6w04g rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Instead of organizing by topic and subtopic, it is much more effective to organize by <em>context</em>. Specifically, the <em>context in which it will be used</em>. The primary question when deciding where to put something becomes “In which context will I want to stumble upon this again?” (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc26zqdwdd5cfd2qv3w4rj rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>In other words, instead of filing things away according to where they came from, you file them according to where they’re going. This is the essential difference between organizing <em>like a librarian</em> and organizing <em>like a writer</em>. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc2acfkdgmj6n85jz3nscr rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>A writer asks “In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note?” They will file it under a paper they are writing, a conference they are speaking at, or an ongoing collaboration with a colleague. These are concrete, near-term deliverables and not abstract categories. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc50nncgnbpnd7s6hf8zch rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Writers don’t think about a single, “correct” location for a piece of information. They deal in “scraps” which can often be repurposed and reused elsewhere. The discarded byproducts from one piece of writing may become the essential pillars of the next one. The slip-box is a thinking tool, not an encyclopedia, so completeness is not important. The only gaps we do need to be concerned about are the gaps in the final manuscript we are working toward. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc8deegk55cb15njwc5zph rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Principle #9: Always follow the most interesting path (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc98ptm5gnv1avs74cv7q5 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>“When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan 2006; Reeve 2009).” (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc9zzw2kvr9vx61zestkey rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>This is why we must spend as much time as possible working on things we find interesting. It is not an indulgence. It is an essential part of making our work sustainable and thus successful. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqca9fgm057w0xsh0vy4rwk rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>This advice runs counter to the typical approach to planning we are taught. We are told to “make a plan” upfront and in detail. Success is then measured by how closely we stick to this plan. Our changing interests and motivations are to be ignored or suppressed if they interfere with the plan. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcax3j087cgmw15pp2p7q6 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Plans are meant to help us feel in control. But it is much more important to actually <em>be</em> in control, which means being able to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant. (

In other words, when we have a choice about what to work on and when, it doesn’t take as much willpower to do it. (

But in creative work, questions change and new directions emerge. That is the nature of insight. So we don’t want to work according to a rigid workflow that is threatened by the unexpected. We need to be able to make small, constant adjustments to keep our interest, motivation, and work aligned. (

By saving ideas that aren’t compatible with each other and don’t necessarily support what we already think, we train ourselves to develop subtle theories over time instead of immediately jumping to conclusions.

<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcnpn7vy7z9xpfrad458rz rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>• Make fleeting notes
• Make literature notes
• Make permanent notes
• Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box
• Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box
• Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box
• Turn your notes into a rough draft
• Edit and proofread your manuscript (

Both were wooden boxes containing paper index cards. (

1. Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep
2. Keep the overall note as short as possible
3. Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim
4. Write down the bibliographic details on the source (

• How does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what I already know?
• How can I combine ideas to generate something new?
• What questions are triggered by these new ideas? (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcvacgzs8rrcrfgv5h6tpy rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</p></li><li><p>Write these permanent notes as if you are writing for someone else. That is, use full sentences, disclose your sources, make explicit references, and try to be as precise and brief as possible. 
Once this step is done, throw away (or delete) the fleeting notes from step one and file the literature notes from step two into your bibliographic slip-box. (
