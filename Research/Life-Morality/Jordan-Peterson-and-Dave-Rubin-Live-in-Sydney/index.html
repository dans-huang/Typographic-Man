that&rsquo;s a decision that we&rsquo;vemade in the West that each personregardless of their flaws ischaracterized by a value an intrinsic value that&rsquo;s so deep and so profoundthat the very regulation of the stateitself rests on their shoulders ( View Highlight) it&rsquo;s thedispersal of responsibility who wantsall that responsibility but there&rsquo;s ahuge price to be paid for it ( View Highlight) thefirst price that you pay for it is wellthere goes the adventure of your lifeit&rsquo;s like you could get yourselftogether and be the bedrock of the stateright that&rsquo;d be hard that call oneverything that you have that would beyour adventure you&rsquo;re gonna pass thatoff to someone else and then then whatdo you do you&rsquo;ve got nothing left inyour life a triviality ( View Highlight) I don&rsquo;t believe thatpeople can live ethically triviallythat&rsquo;s why I think the pursuit of theidea that life is for happiness is wrongbecause life is too difficult for thatto be the case our lives are tooprofound to characterized by sufferingand malevolence the world is toocharacterized by trouble at every levelfor happiness to be the proper solutionthe solution is something like a heavy burden of ethical responsibility thekind that sets the state straight andthen in that you find the purpose ofyour life ( View Highlight) so not only if you wantthe external monitoring and thesurveillance state not only do yousacrifice your privacy and invite allthat invasive attention and lose yourimpulsive freedom you lose everythingthat&rsquo;s profound about your life andsomeone takes it from you they take your destiny from you and that&rsquo;s no way tolive ( View Highlight) evenunder terrible circumstances there were ways of being more or less noble and Isuppose it would be under terriblecircumstances where that sort of thingwould be put to the test ( View Highlight) itreally made him think about his own rolein his own demise ( View Highlight) Solzhenitsyn noted thatthere were people even under these extreme circumstances that would tellthe truth and he decided that he wouldgo over his life with a fine-tooth combhe had nothing but time to think aboutevery time he had acted in some mannerin his life that transgressed againsthis own conscience right that where hedid something he knew to be wrong andthen to see if he could figure out howto set it right then now obviously hecouldn&rsquo;t necessarily apologize to thepeople against who he had transgressedright sometimes you have to pay for something you did in a currency otherthan that which you took and hisdetermination was to chronicle hisexperiences in his truthful manner aspossible which was basically impossible ( View Highlight) so hebasically memorized the book and it&rsquo;s2,400 pages long of 8-point type likeit&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a it&rsquo;s one remarkable workit&rsquo;s one long scream of truthful outrageyou know and that came out of hisdecision to set himself right and then it was as John said it was smuggled intothe West where it had a walloping impactit completely demolished at least for along while the moral credibility ofcommunism completely from like 1972 onif you knew about the existence of theGulag Archipelago you didn&rsquo;t get tosay anything good about communism andthat lasted for a long time it evenconvinced French intellectuals thatthere was something wrong with communismand there&rsquo;s no doubt that it was one ofthe historical events that caused the Soviet Union to collapse ( View Highlight) you thinkwell what power do you have if you&rsquo;rewilling to tell the truth it&rsquo;s not easyto tell the truth it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s complicatedyou have to take yourself into accountright over the long run you have to takeyour family into account you have totake your society into account you haveto think it through you have to thinkstrategically and then you have to findyour words and that&rsquo;s hard to find yourwords because you tend to use otherpeople&rsquo;s words or ideological words orwords that mask or hide it&rsquo;s not easy to find your own words but if you find yourown words and there are truthful wordsthere isn&rsquo;t anything that can stop them ( View Highlight) youhave the power of your convictions inyour truth and your ability tocommunicate and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s supposedto set the state straight ( View Highlight) maybe it&rsquo;s truth that you&rsquo;re pursuingand seeking if you have any sense andwhat truth well truth is the bestreflection you can manage of realityimperfect because you&rsquo;re imperfect butit&rsquo;s the best you&rsquo;ve got it&rsquo;s like whatwhat&rsquo;s gonna be better for you than tohave reality on your side and what&rsquo;sgonna stand in your way if you havereality on your side ( View Highlight) if you believed infalsehood it&rsquo;s like good get on with itman you could be a criminal and lay yourlife out and see how that works and ifyou believe in truth well then perhapsyou put yourself on the line for thetruth ( View Highlight) but you don&rsquo;t play the the two sides against the middle because there&rsquo;sthere&rsquo;s nothing in that that isn&rsquo;tself-serving at the cost of your ownwell-being and at the cost of everyoneelse&rsquo;s ( View Highlight) most people whotrust are naive and naive is not a virtue it&rsquo;s a fault it&rsquo;s partly a faultbecause if you&rsquo;re naive and you run intosomeone who&rsquo;s malevolent including youthey might do you incalculable damage sothat you will never recoverso that&rsquo;s not a good thing you don&rsquo;twant to be naive ( View Highlight) if you&rsquo;re not naivethat means you&rsquo;ve been burned once ortwice or three or four times and youknow once you&rsquo;ve been burned in thatmanner well then it&rsquo;s hard to trustbecause you think well why would I trustyou or me for that matter knowing fullwell that I can be betrayed and so then you&rsquo;re cynical and you think that&rsquo;s animprovement over being naive ( View Highlight) thisis a crucial thing to know you trustpeople because you&rsquo;re courageous that&rsquo;swhy it&rsquo;s the same reason that you&rsquo;regrateful it&rsquo;s a mark of courage it&rsquo;s amark of commitment it&rsquo;s like you and Iwe&rsquo;re gonna make an agreement and you&rsquo;re full of snakes and so am i and there&rsquo;slots of ways this can go sideways butwe&rsquo;re going to put together an agreementwe&rsquo;re gonna articulate it out we&rsquo;regonna try to find something that is ofmutual benefit to both of us we&rsquo;re gonnaput our hands out and shake and we&rsquo;regonna try to stick to that and we&rsquo;regonna risk trusting each other ( View Highlight) that&rsquo;s the risk uponwhich the state is based really like Ibelieve and I think the evidence forthis is very strong by the way I don&rsquo;tthink that there is any other naturalresource than trust and for trust you need courage not naivety and you go toovercome your cynicism so that you trust ( View Highlight) ifyou&rsquo;re cynical about the institutionsit&rsquo;s like look in the mirror becausethose institutions the corruption ofthose institutions is a direct reflection of your inability to get youract together and that&rsquo;s what it means tobe a sovereign part of the Westerncommunity so it&rsquo;s not someone else ( View Highlight) it&rsquo;s very very difficult very very verydifficult to take a system that worksnot too badly and to do anything to itthat doesn&rsquo;t make it worsemuch less to radically reconstitute itand make it better ( View Highlight) democracy is not a machine it&rsquo;s a spiritin which the peculiar Christianconception that no matter what yourstation in life is each of us has aspark of the divine and every soul is ofequal value before heaven ( View Highlight) we&rsquo;ve knockedout the idea that whether I agree withyou or not doesn&rsquo;t matter I have torespect you because they&rsquo;re a higherauthority places as much value on you ashe does on me now it seems that theproblem is that if you dare disagreewith me I don&rsquo;t have a reference framefor good and bad anymore or forrespecting you therefore I have to assist I&rsquo;m right ( View Highlight) we lack a framework for respecting oneanother and it seems a massive problemfor us ( View Highlight) ifyour defining characteristic is thatyou&rsquo;re a member of a collective then youlive or die by the propriety of the collective the the antidote to that isthat strange metaphysical claim which isthat well which is fundamentally that weeach have a spark of the Divine in us ( View Highlight) it&rsquo;s easy to be cynicalabout that but youshouldn&rsquo;t be because you act like it&rsquo;strue and that&rsquo;s worth noticing ( View Highlight) if youever say a 21 year old child and they&rsquo;reupset with you they say well I&rsquo;m 21years old I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m able to make my own decisions and you say and they want youto agree with that and you want to agreewith it because you hope that there areready to make their own decisions andyou think well maybe they haven&rsquo;tmatured to that point ( View Highlight) so what are yousayingwell you&rsquo;re saying that they are giftedwith the ability to take theresponsibility to shape the realityaround them and they insist upon thatthey insist upon you recognizing that inthem as a hallmark of respect and love ( View Highlight) and you know you might be irritatedbecause they&rsquo;re not acting responsiblyenough to deserve that but it&rsquo;s stillwhat you hope for and want it&rsquo;s so likewell so what is it we&rsquo;re the sovereigncornerstone of the state ( View Highlight) what do westruggle with day to day we strugglewith the potential that&rsquo;s in front of usand transforming that into the realitythat could be that&rsquo;s as close to a divine faculty as anything I can thinkof it&rsquo;s completely mysterious that wecan wrestle with the fabric of becomingand turn it into the actuality of beingand that we seem to do that as aconsequence of our ethical choices ( View Highlight) we have that spark of divinity it&rsquo;sassociated with a deep deepresponsibility and it&rsquo;sthe ability that goes along with thatand we play that out all the time weplay it out every time we play fairgames with one another we have we havedecent honest relationships with oneanother we have business arrangementsthat are honest and work and we cancooperate for long periods of time wetake care of our children properly we take care of our old people properlyit&rsquo;s all predicated on the same thingyou have intrinsic value and even if youdo something terrible let&rsquo;s say and Istill have the the conviction that youhave value then it&rsquo;s incumbent on me tosay well you did something terrible butyou aren&rsquo;t necessarily somethingterrible and it might be possible foryou to shed that and to atone and torejoin those who good and that&rsquo;ssomething to and it&rsquo;s built deeply into our political and economic and justicesystems and it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s no time to beabandoning this ( View Highlight) I was going to try toformulate my thoughts truthfully and thereason I decided that was because I thought that the opposite was hellishlydangerous and I really I really I reallybelieve that I truly believe that and soI&rsquo;m if I say things and I think they&rsquo;retrue and they get me in trouble then Ithink well that&rsquo;s not as much trouble asI would have got into if I would havesaid something that wasn&rsquo;t true ( View Highlight) what I&rsquo;m here for is to hear thequestions and try to figure out what Ithink about them and then to say thatand then to see what happens like who the hell knows what&rsquo;s gonna happenbut there&rsquo;s here&rsquo;s an if if the world isproperly constituted through truth thenfaith is the willingness to have faithin truth ( View Highlight) you say what you believe tobe the truth and then you have the faiththat no matter what happens if you&rsquo;vesaidwhat you believe to be truth whateverhappens is the best thing that couldhave happened and I believe that I thinkthat&rsquo;s how the world&rsquo;s constituted ( View Highlight) if you tell the truth that means you&rsquo;rerevealing your being that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;redoing when you&rsquo;re telling the truth andwhen you when you reveal your being thenyou&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re living in the world you&rsquo;rethere you&rsquo;re present right your your your your that&rsquo;s being there let&rsquo;s saythat&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s your destiny that&rsquo;syour journey that&rsquo;s your adventurethat&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s gonna justify your lifethe adventure it&rsquo;s not gonna be easy butman if you hide from your truth wellthen you hide from yourself and thenyou&rsquo;re not even there and then who thehell are you what are you the puppetyou&rsquo;re the puppet of some coward you&rsquo;rethe puppet of some dictator or somesecond-rate philosopher some idiotic idea or a bully you were afraid of ingrade six god only knows but it&rsquo;s notyou living your life and then you loseyour life and you lose your soul too ( View Highlight) what&rsquo;s happening Ithink on the me to end of things and the affirmative consent end of things is theold sexual taboos are reassertingthemselves the idea that we can extractsex out from emotional intimacy andespecially emotional intimacy I wouldsay psychological intimacy maybe evenfromlong-term relationship is I don&rsquo;tbelieve it&rsquo;s a tenable idea I don&rsquo;tthink we can do it and a lot of whatwe&rsquo;re seeing is the backlash againstthat ( View Highlight) we need to have a veryserious conversation about that likeunder what circumstances is itacceptable to give consent but we&rsquo;re notmature enough to have that conversationwe want both ways we want to be able todo whatever we want whatever with whatwith whoever we want whenever we wantwith no consequences and we want therenever to be any trouble about consent ( View Highlight) between 20 and 30 there&rsquo;sa lot of things to get straight andlong-term mate is usually one of themand most of the time people should be more careful with their sexual behaviorwhen they&rsquo;re young especially whenthey&rsquo;re drunk than they are ( View Highlight) despite the fact that we have reliable birth control we&rsquo;re going to have torelearn what the acceptable rules ofpropriety are with regards to sexualrelationships ( View Highlight) don&rsquo;t doanything physically with anyone that youwouldn&rsquo;t talk to them about because ifyou&rsquo;re too damn embarrassed to talkabout it well maybe it&rsquo;s a littlepremature in the relationship toactually do it and then there&rsquo;s harm inityou know there&rsquo;s emotional harm in it throw on both parties there&rsquo;s thecheapening of both parties ( View Highlight)
