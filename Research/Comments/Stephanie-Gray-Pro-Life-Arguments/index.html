<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JQKZsfy_YdM" rel=noopener>https://youtube.com/watch?v=JQKZsfy_YdM</a></li></ul><hr><p>The sovereignty of individual is the deepest truth I can currently conceive of and can&rsquo;t reason any deeper. I almost have to take a leap of faith and believe that each one of use is made in the image of God, as it sets the very fundamental for our sovereign existence.</p><p>To be valued both by ourselves and by others, is an undeniable instinct we all share and the basis of how we conduct our lives. We like to live as if we&rsquo;re something of value and we like it when others validate that ideas, and others will find us respectful only when we treat them the same way.</p><p>Free will or not, we as humans like to live as if we&rsquo;re conscious agency of our being. We certainly don&rsquo;t like to be devalued as if we&rsquo;re merely objects or means to an end, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll feel used, taken advantage of, lied to, and betrayed.</p><p>Almost universally, the ideal life we can possibly imagine for ourselves consists of something involving appreciation and care from our family, validation and recognition for our work, cherishment and love from our partners, and affirmation and respect for ourselves. This is the very instinct we live of, and the ideal we live towards.</p><p>So it&rsquo;s undeniable that one of, if not the very thing we want in our life, is to be valued as a human being, in whatever way we individually desire. Being valued as an individual can give us tremendous meaning and help us get through significant amount of hardships, which is why the voluntarily adoption of responsibility is one of the quickest way to cultivate drive and meaning for your life.</p><p>This is why in our daily life, we should not only view ourselves as individuals as values and not accept ourselves to be used (to be enslaved by other&rsquo;s emotions or actions), but should also be wary not to reduce any person&rsquo;s individuality down to his/her look, race, gender, opinion, action, and belief. As tempting as it is to do so, by fighting this lazy and irresponsible attempt to reduce people into less than who they are and dehumanize them, we form a much stronger basis for public discussion, social affair, mutual understanding, genuine and trustful interaction on all levels. This is a moral pillar for a strong and stable society.</p><p>So this leads us to why watching porn is wrong - and I&rsquo;m mainly talking about the act of watching people have sex for one&rsquo;s own pleasure - is because this act is equivalent to exploiting the performers for one&rsquo;s own usage and reduces them to merely objects for certain means. Watching porn is not wrong because sex and body are sinful, but this the very act we should avoid as it&rsquo;s wrong in and of itself, whether or not the performer likes it or if it&rsquo;s hurting anyone.</p><p>And so there&rsquo;s no more dangerous idea than what some people might think &lsquo;humans as parasites on earth&rsquo;. Such view might come from the care for the environment as well as the pessimistic view for humanity, but it&rsquo;s nonetheless a catastrophic idea. Such idea is not only not helpful (should we just line people up and shoot them? tell people to quit having children?), but itself degrades the value of the person promoting it, which is why it&rsquo;s catastrophic - it&rsquo;s an idea that can bring demise to the very person withholding it. And that&rsquo;s precisely what many mass shooter did - when one REALLY believes there to be no value in humanity and its existence, the most logical act would be to kill as many people as possible before one commit suicide.</p><p>That leads us to suicide. Imagine the ideal life we talked about where your value is appreciated, now consider the opposite direction, where a person is totally not valued. Despite there&rsquo;re many other complex reasons why people lead to suicidal thoughts,</p><p>&mldr;The very suicide attempt is the doing (direct result) of the circumstances in which the person is not valued, so the only real self-conscious decision in the midst of it would be to stand up and live as if you&rsquo;re a valuable individual. Do not let the whole self destructing circumstance consume you into nothingness, which is what the darkness of this world can sometimes do to people.</p><p><a href=https://youtu.be/JQKZsfy_YdM rel=noopener>https://youtu.be/JQKZsfy_YdM</a></p><p>Key foundation that pro-life arguments are based on: Value of a living being (human) is based on the potential (human-ness) that one possesses, not on whether one can express that fully at a given moment.</p><p>The same can be said to those with brain damage (or even brain dead) or seriously ill. People will do what they can to hold on to these loved ones in the hope of them being well again - to realize the potential of being a human in this world again. It seems somewhat illogical or cruel to disregard that part of a embryo just because it hasnâ€™t have the chance to prove its capacity of human-ness and establish a relationship with anyone, yet.</p><p>However, how do we determine which potential is greater? The motherâ€™s potential without carrying this unwanted child, or the potential of both of them living, or even the potential of the child at the expense of sacrificing the motherâ€™s life if needed? In different period of the human history we seemed to have different answers, and Iâ€™m not so sure how to answer this one at this moment, and Iâ€™m quite certain this answer is unanswerable.</p><p>For the most part Iâ€™d still suppot a society with minimal interference of peopleâ€˜s live from the government and I do not trust governments for achieving greater goods for most citizens (as I do believe in the sovereignty of individualâ€˜s choices) and I do want to stay away from authoritarian regime of most kinds. Iâ€™d still propose a free, libertarianism socieity with minimal interference from the governments but with high moral standards of the people - having the shared sense of responsibility of the people goes hand-in-hand with the optimized freedom.</p><a href=#highlights><h2 id=highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Highlights</h2></a><ul><li><blockquote><p>On Pro-choice position:</p></blockquote><ul><li>it comes down to autonomy. we are a culture obsessed with autonomy, obsessed with choice and control. so people in support of abortion would argue that it&rsquo;s about my bodily autonomy, my right to control my body, and therefore if I want to have an abortion which is something that involves my body being laid down on the abortionist table then I should be allowed to access that (

But if the test comes up positive and she doesn&rsquo;t want to be pregnant, will she then consider going to the abortion clinic? yes.</li><li>what is it that the positive test is telling her versus what the negative test is telling? the negative test is basically saying: it&rsquo;s just your body, don&rsquo;t worry it&rsquo;s just you, but the moment she has a positive pregnancy test, that&rsquo;s telling her it&rsquo;s no longer just her body, there&rsquo;s another body there, that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s thinking about going to the abortion clinic, an action she would never take if she had the negative test.</li><li>so the very fact that she&rsquo;s now going to the abortion clinic is an admission there&rsquo;s another body present so what about that body&rsquo;s bodily autonomy? what about that individuals choice? the choice I could make to lay my body down on the abortionist table is a choice that if I&rsquo;m pregnant is going to impact another body and if I believe in bodily rights and I need to protect the bodily rights of that pre born human being (

I can do almost anything yes, the question is should I do that in a civil society, in a society that believes all humans are equal, in a society that believes in the fundamental human right to life?

<a href="https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b817c739485f00095eff87" rel=noopener>TimeÂ 0:17:50</a>)</li></ul></li><li><blockquote><p>On the cases of sexual assault:</p></blockquote><ul><li>there&rsquo;s two approaches that we need to take: there&rsquo;s the approach of the heart and the approach of the head. we need to start with the former, we need to acknowledge that anyone who&rsquo;s been victimized by sexual assault has been victimized, that they&rsquo;ve been traumatized, that is a brutal assault for which there really aren&rsquo;t words to capture how vile it is. while I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve personally experienced it I have observed through friendship the impact that has had on people who have personally experienced that, and I can acknowledge that is a terrible thing, and those people who have been hurt need our support, they need our love, our compassion, and counseling, and so on and so forth.</li><li>the question we then need to ask moving from the heart to the head, so there&rsquo;s an expression of sympathy and then this introduction of logic: will abortion un-raped a rape victim? will it undo the trauma? will it take away the evil that is happening (
<a href="https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b818075007ba0009a41dba" rel=noopener>TimeÂ 0:19:06</a>)</li><li>(It won&rsquo;t but you can remove the brutal reminder by not giving birth to the baby)
so we acknowledge that there&rsquo;s some reminder, but we can&rsquo;t acknowledge that to the point to think that if we took that particular reminder away, that we&rsquo;d be eliminating all other reminders, that there wouldn&rsquo;t be things there.</li><li>the next point I would make is that I would ask the question is it fair to give the death penalty to the innocent child that&rsquo;s a consequence we don&rsquo;t even give to the rapist in America (
<a href="https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8186e39485f00095eff88" rel=noopener>TimeÂ 0:20:52</a>)</li><li>generally, abortion supporters I find are not supporters of the death penalty, so these are individuals that wouldn&rsquo;t give the death penalty to a rapist, they wouldn&rsquo;t give the death penalty to a murderer. so then we ask if you won&rsquo;t give the death penalty to guilty people, why would you ever consider giving the death penalty to an innocent person? that in the circumstance of rape, the guilty party is not the preborn child, the guilty party is not the woman, the guilty party is the rapist. so we&rsquo;re now talking with the act of abortion about giving a consequence a punishment to the innocent party that we&rsquo;re not even giving to the guilty party, and even if we were giving that to the guilty party, I think we should all agree that no innocent person should ever paid the price of a crime that they themselves have not committed.
so I would make the point that abortion is not gonna un-rape a rape victim, it is not going to take away the memories that she&rsquo;s been traumatized, and then most fundamentally, a society that supports human rights may not give punishment for a crime that the individual being punished has actually not committed, that they&rsquo;re not guilty of.

so the fact that you have experienced being rational conscious and self-aware right now and then you might lose that ability to currently act on that if you&rsquo;re under anesthetic if you&rsquo;re sleeping and then you&rsquo;re going to come out of those situations and act again the fact that you&rsquo;ve previously had this experience why does that matter in contrast to the embryo who has not yet had that experience why is that relevant I would ask the abortion supporter to articulate why (

Then when you&rsquo;re freed hopefully from this situation, you don&rsquo;t have to go on and raise the child.</li><li>now the abortion supporter might then say well then if you have to help the child in the cabin in the woods where you&rsquo;re both kidnapped, shouldn&rsquo;t you have to help the violinist? because you&rsquo;re not related to the child and you&rsquo;re not related to the violinist. so then it comes down to our basic or ordinary needs, versus extraordinary needs - in the case of the violinist needing to be plugged into my body.

I&rsquo;d say the kidney exists in my body, for my body, but the uterus is very different. the uterus exists in my body, every single month getting ready for someone else&rsquo;s body, every single month my uterine lining is thickening in great expectation for the implantation of the next generation. therefore, you could say the uterus is unique from all the other body parts, in that it exists more for my offspring then for me, and they can therefore claim a right to that in contrary to the born child who can&rsquo;t claim a right to get your kidney.

two reasons: one we might feel more affection - just natural affection - for the child, that we&rsquo;ve perhaps even held or comforted or played with. but two, there&rsquo;s a part of it is an analysis of success.
almost like a triage situation, where it&rsquo;s like if I grab this child and I get the child out of the building, I&rsquo;ve not only saved this child in this instant, but this child is gonna keep living, so I have the likelihood of success in removing this child from the building. I don&rsquo;t have that likelihood of success when I run out of the building with with 20 frozen embryos, because first of all I don&rsquo;t want them to thaw or they&rsquo;re gonna die, but if I&rsquo;m taking the the canister out of the building, does it need to be plugged into something so are they gonna die in the process of removing? even if I can somehow use a generator - or whatever is needed to keep them in their frozen state, when they&rsquo;re out of the building then what do I have a likely to success? will they be implanted, should they be implanted that&rsquo;s a whole other ethical dilemma? is it ethical to implant embryos in other human beings who are not they&rsquo;re their biological parents? and so part of it could be, beyond the emotional connection, the likelihood of success of actually saving lives.
so once you start to break down the scenario, you realize this isn&rsquo;t a case for abortion. Inability to save is not the same as direct killing, and it&rsquo;s certainly not saying that if I don&rsquo;t save you that you&rsquo;re not equal to the one I saved. (
