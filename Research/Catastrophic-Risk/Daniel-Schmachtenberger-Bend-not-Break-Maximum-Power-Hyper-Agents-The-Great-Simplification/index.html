the financial system has an embedded growth obligation it has to keep growing or this particular system breaks and it has to keep growing at a percentage of the previous year so you have a compounding interest thing which means you have an exponential curve so there is an exponential embedded growth obligation on finance but finance is bound to the real world and you can&rsquo;t exponentially grow the extraction in the real world specifically you can&rsquo;t keep mining stuff on renewably and turning into pollution and trash and you can&rsquo;t keep having the 11:00energy that it takes to move all those atoms or the bits around um indefinitely (

this is why the jeffers paradox is so fundamental is ultimately the dollars are seeking returns anywhere and they&rsquo;ll seek the highest returns possible but they&rsquo;ll seek any returns too there will be a power law distribution on return so i can get 1000x return of course i&rsquo;ll get it but if i can get a three percent return i&rsquo;ll you know a large amount of capital we&rsquo;ll do that so when you get increases in efficiency you just get a cheaper industrial input you know a cheaper market input which means that a lot of things that weren&rsquo;t profitable now become profitable so the surface area of profitability expands 13:30and this jevon&rsquo;s paradox just like everybody who&rsquo;s focused on environmental issues needs to kind of take this very seriously which is you increase efficiency of say here energy production now you have cheaper energy energy is one of the key inputs to every industry cheaper input means a whole bunch of non-profitable areas become profitable and the market expands (
