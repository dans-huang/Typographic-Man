在某些方面，婚姻是兩個人的結合，但在更根本的方面，它是兩個人的結合，為孩子們提供基礎，我想說，這實際上是最重要的，我們的社會傾向於把它顛倒過來，我們傾向於認為婚姻是這樣的，當你找到適合你的伴侶時，你從此幸福地生活，不完全是，但也許是，如果你也明白，從此幸福地生活意味著在許多方面為其他人生活，特別是你的孩子。 in some ways marriage is the union of two people but in a possibly more fundamental way it&amp;rsquo;s the union of two people to provide the foundation for children right and i would say that&amp;rsquo;s actually paramount i mean our society tends to flip that around and we tend to think of marriage as something that while you find the partner right for you 11:30and you live happily ever after no not exactly, or maybe exactly if you also understand that living happily ever after means living for other people in many ways particularly your children ( Time 0:11:09)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Comments/Glenn-Loury-Ian-Rowe-and-Robert-Woodson-Debunk-Myths-about-the-Black-Experience-in-America/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Comments/Glenn-Loury-Ian-Rowe-and-Robert-Woodson-Debunk-Myths-about-the-Black-Experience-in-America/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 aliases: URL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=hIiyIEyUxu8

對話的社會意義 我們在思想交流中找到了意識的定義。上升到你我意識中的東西，就是可以被打包作為與人交流的東西，這顯示了我們是如此地社會性。
在充滿互動性的集體意識、以及必然存在的私人（意識）版本之間，存在著一種起伏和流動。在集體思考不被允許時（可以稱之為思想的黑暗時代）仍然堅持獨立思考的人，我稱之為「火炬的守護者」。
不幸地，我們正處於一個奇怪的黑暗時代：在某方面，我們從未有過這麼適合相互交流的科技工具，然而公開透明的對話卻也前所未有地不被歡迎。我們現在需要找到一種機制來重新啟動這個對話，而這必須從這個問題開始：我們是否能夠同意「對話」存在著無可取代的重要性。
社會變革 僅僅因為你搞清楚事物的一項功能，並不意味著你已經搞清楚了它的所有功能——一如[[切斯特頓的圍欄]]——有太多的現代人草率地推翻那些過去運作良好的事物，只為了支持新的、但沒有證據顯示能長久矗立的措施。 教育 我們過度保護我們的孩童。他們生活在一個——在很大的程度上——風險已經被清除到所剩無幾的世界裡，於是當他們面臨風險的時候，他們沒有工具來管理、面對它，所以他們才會要求安全感、要求有人可以給他們一個跟成長過程中一樣安全的長大世界——這是不可能的。這不但對他們一點好處也沒有，我們甚至因為這樣的要求而撕裂了社會。
我們總是知道，一個人十八歲生日那天並沒有發生任何神奇的事情、突然之間你就便成了成年人；現實是這是一系列、漸進的、演化的過程，它需要經驗的累積。否則，我們就會有很多——我們其實已經有太多——生理上成年、殫心理上還是小孩的人。
先人的文化傳統、跟他們所身處的環境是完全或幾乎對等的。意思是說，正確的教訓會自動被習得，因為那是一個危險的世界，卻也是一個透過思考你該做什麼、做你應該做的事情、在你感到恐懼時更謹慎行事的世界。問題是我們現在移除了這個機制，然後搞不清楚接下來該怎麼辦。
唯有當你面臨險境並採取正確的方式去處理，你才會成長為一個能夠處理這些事情的成年人。
養大了一整個世代沒有暴露在風險之下、沒有能力駕馭這些事情的孩子，在社會層面上是個尤其悲劇的事。跟隱含了一定風險的社會相比，它並不會留下同樣明確的死亡人數、不會留下屍體，但他是一個更糟的結局、更大的平均值——這或許是化約主義的問題：你可以很容易地指出一個不幸死亡的孩子，而要指出幾代人不曉得該如何駕馭自己的情緒、身體、和人生抉擇，就困難得多。
色情片 讓色情片成為一個特殊類別的，是市場對其內容的影響。當製作色情片的人在市場上相互競爭以獲得更多的關注，他們便會需要突破原先的界線、進以在飽和的市場上脫穎而出。
透過色情片來理解自身性偏好及性生活的人，會深深地內化「一切都是以我為中心」的訊息，無論看色情片的人怎麼做都沒辦法改變這點。而當他們找到可能成為他們人生伴侶的人時，他們會缺乏正確的觀念去建立起真正的人際關係。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Comments/How-to-Improve-Twitter-Lex-Fridman-Kimbal-Musk-Eric-Weinstein-and-Liv-Boeree/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Comments/How-to-Improve-Twitter-Lex-Fridman-Kimbal-Musk-Eric-Weinstein-and-Liv-Boeree/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 aliases: ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ARgV3meTq8&amp;ab_channel=LexFridman

教育並不會讓人「更聰明」，教育是要讓人學習當代（以及對未來拙劣的預測）所需的技能和知識。 人的聰明才智終究是常態分佈，一代裡聰明和不聰明的人比例並不會相差太多。 「更多高等教育畢業生＝讓下一代人更聰明更有競爭力」是個天真的想法。這最終只讓我們有更多大學生，創造出大學生素質比以前更低的錯覺。 這個錯覺之所以是錯覺，是因為我們錯以為讓人去念大學可提昇「素質」，但並不會。我們只是讓可以去念大學的門檻變低，讓「素質」比較不好的人也能成為大學生而已。亦即學歷的通膨。 知識經濟並不會讓我們需要更多大學生，只是讓我們重新檢視教育的內容究竟該是什麼，究竟哪些知識和工具是有助於下一代人在知識經濟世界中生存。 21世紀的NBA球員之所以比五十年前的球員更強大、強大到幾乎是不同星球的人類，並不是因為現代人比較會打籃球、或有比較多會打籃球的人，而是因為人類在這項運動上累積的知識和工具讓我們更能夠有效地訓練，讓本來就有天份的人能夠拿出以前人不知道可能的表現。如果說這是現代人比較會打籃球，是個很奇怪的推論。 不幸的是，教育政策的制定者和改革者通常只了解過去，而根本不知道未來會需要的知識和工具是什麼。這往往不是他們的錯，因為預知未來本身就是件不可能的事。 大部分的產業仍然可以被傳統教育所滿足，所以普遍的教育基本上只需要讓大部分的學生具備應該要有的技能和知識，就已經是功德圓滿。不需要太刻意地超前部屬（但當然可以讓部份辦學者去嘗試不同類型的超前部屬、有針對性的教育目的），因為教育界的傳統菁英不大可能對未來需要的東西可以有像樣的認知。 學校需要做的事情，其實主要是提供大家已經更新到最新版的知識和工具，讓在不同聰明才智程度的人可以盡量「跟上」世界當前的狀態。不過就算學校在這部份做得不好，現在也已經有太多工具讓人可以真正地接觸最新的知識和工具。 我們不該以為更多大學生可以幫助我們迎接知識經濟，因為滿街大學生都可佐證他們在學校所學根本沒有幫他們為出社會做準備。恰巧相反，現代人前所未有地發現自己在學校所學根本沒辦法拿到工作上用。 之所以我們還是會追求唸好大學，是因為挑選菁英大學畢業生對大部分企業仍然是個行得通的穩健策略，就算菁英大學中偶爾出現一些較差的案例，只要學歷在大方向上仍然是個夠可靠的指標，民間企業就沒有好理由放棄，於是菁英大學學歷就仍有價值，辦學者就仍會努力讓學校變得更「菁英」（不管上了什麼榜、對學生究竟有沒有幫助），學生於是就會努力擠進菁英大學——一個惡質的多極陷阱，沒有人能夠主動改變這個生態。 只會有部份時代尖端（因此學校教育還沒跟上）、或是本來就無法靠正規教育建立技能的產業，才會主動拋棄學歷、用其他方式評斷一個求職者的能力。但這很難同時大規模地發生於整個社會，除非整個社會在短時間內都發現學歷和素質的落差真的已經差到這個指標只是虛有其表。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Comments/Stephanie-Gray-Pro-Life-Arguments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Comments/Stephanie-Gray-Pro-Life-Arguments/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟩 aliases: Pro-life, Against abortion, Motherhood

想透過公共議題牟利者，最佳路徑就是鼓吹仇恨。而仇恨的根源是什麼？你我為何會對素未謀面者充滿恨意？ 這跟各種主義煽動的概念相同，先讓你把事情簡單化，相信有單一答案，然後與這個答案違背者就是錯的。既然對方是錯的，還能如此堅持，必定有某些邪惡的念頭，那麼惡即斬就沒錯了。 ( View Highlight) 通常，事情都有個先後，架構也有分大小，例如某個藥廠的理念「先講究不傷身體、再講究效果」，架構就是所有的效果都得建立在「不傷身」上，簡單到不能再簡單。 各種治療效果可以複雜，但簡單化不能脫離大架構，也就是不傷身體這個原則。 ( View Highlight) 煽動性言論，是把這兩個逆轉，讓你相信各種效果可以很簡單，從而瓦解、忽略大架構。例如： 「這款感冒藥的成分與國外知名XX牌一樣，價格卻只要一半？顯然有鬼。」 暗示感冒藥可能傷身，從而去瓦解掉「先講究不傷身體」的前提。但是，這段敘述有沒有辦法破解？很容易啊，光是從國外進口來的運費，跟國內自行生產可以省下的成本，售價較低不是理所當然？ 對，所以煽動性言論，就是用各種話術、論證，要你專注在「相同成分價格一半，顯然有問題」這件事。 ( View Highlight) 「義大利出產橄欖油一瓶500，台灣回收油一瓶50，難怪國產沙拉油只賣200！」 「不要扯那麼多，怎麼可能價錢差到一半，當大家沒買過菜嗎？」 每一套論述的邏輯，單純只看敘述都是合理，但架構上就是不對，故意的。目的就是要把焦點轉移到單純的價錢上，忽略掉價錢跟成本有關，而這可能就是該藥廠的優勢。而透過這種操作，讀者最後只會記得一開始的敘述「價錢只要一半怎麼可能」，相信了暗示「這藥有問題」。 「不要扯那麼多，怎麼可能價錢一樣，當大家沒買過菜嗎？」 您猜對了，煽動性言論是萬用句型，充滿各種疑問句跟暗示，很少跟你直指核心。謠言則是在當中加入「證據」，例如報關行的一頁文書，內政部的一紙公文，每一個步驟都是在「純化」敘述，營造一個複雜的大架構。 ( View Highlight) 失敗的科普文，跟謠言與煽動言論某種程度上一樣。想盡辦法，讓過程都看來很簡單，卻湊不出一個具有一致性的大前提，差別在失敗的科普文來自於作者的寫作功力，謠言跟煽動文則出自心懷不軌的寫手。 ( View Highlight) 大致上，如果探討一個有層次的議題，像是為何台灣足球發展不起來，這涉及到非常大的範圍，從基層教育、體育風氣、媒體帶動……每一層都可以寫十萬字長文。一般的普及作者，會犯的錯誤是把這些過程簡化再簡化，最後得到： • 「教育部就是爛」 • 「家長就是守舊」 • 「媒體只看錢」 這有說跟沒說一樣的結論，讀者最後看完，除了留下少許疑惑，更多的是不解與憤怒。 這不叫做普及，只是心得。普及的重點是協助讀者成長，從中獲得一些有用的東西。 ( View Highlight) 請試著以有限字數，說明複雜的架構並導出簡單的結論 ( View Highlight) 普及文的重點，是要能夠在短短幾百上千個字內，讓讀者能抓到問題，理解其複雜架構，這必須從前幾篇說的「難易度」、「複雜度」著手。 ( View Highlight)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Conservatism/Eugenics-Flawed-Thinking-Behind-Pushed-Science-Alex-Story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Conservatism/Eugenics-Flawed-Thinking-Behind-Pushed-Science-Alex-Story/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟩 aliases: ref: https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZAaY0gbis4s

序 保守主義並不等於「某些教條」，反而更近於「穩健」。 精確的描述保守主義，會是「文字容易看懂，涵義難以理解，通達極需經驗」。 若是著重於描述現狀，那麼「保守是態度、保守派是大雜燴、保守主義只是原則」。反面的敘述可能更好，當有一個人宣稱保守主義「就是這個教條」時，那他應該完全不懂什麼是保守主義。
有些走馬克思路線的方法論，用唯物論的觀點去解析西方保守主義，完全失去了conservertive的原旨原味，變成「看來很好理解但實際上差距甚遠」。 只是有信仰，確實是比沒有要容易上手，至少跟自稱無神論，卻對某些科學論理信奉如聖經般的人，要容易理解。 現代保守主義的許多價值，跟筆者從小信仰的基督宗教是高度、密切相關，沒有浸淫在基督教的生活中，會很難理解上述這些作品，關於保守主義中強調的內在價值，到底是什麼玩意。一旦ㄖ無法體會，就會感到現代的保守主義者，言必稱上帝是非常基本教義派的行為，但這與實際狀況差異甚遠。
保守主義偏向概念跟原則，意即從內在價值發出，再外顯到行為上，而非反過來。 這些內在價值不是只有普世性的一致性，故不能輕易的認為，東方的哲學思想可以代換，把基督教換成儒教也會有一樣的結果。這類粗糙的對比只會有害於理解，讓我們將複雜的人類社會，簡化成一兩個教條的施行，非常不妥。我們可以將某一些概念引用，例如「己所不欲、勿施於人」，在全世界每個文化圈中都有類似的說法，但不能用幾句成語，就認為宗教都一個樣。 有熟悉基督教的人去看整套歐美發展的保守主義，絕對是比較駕輕就熟。近年筆者看到批判歐美保守派的台灣人，不管是住在台灣還是移民美國，其批判完全失去重點，不僅僅是誤解的程度，更像是紮稻草人打。更因為對基督教的不熟悉，尤其是對內在價值的不理解，將自己無法體會的價值，輕易批鬥成無科學根據，但批判者自己對科學之理解恐怕遠比批判對象要少。 再加上網路時代要找到特殊案例，用來批評既有的價值實在太簡單，導致許多人輕易相信，舊有價值是全盤錯誤，需要接受有現代性、進步性的科學觀點，去打造符合當代的標準。但相對的，在這些新價值中出現行為失序者，批評舊有價值者卻反而會為之辯護，「少數脫序行為，不能責怪整套理論」。 之前批評其他理論時不是說「一個受害者都嫌多」，怎麼現在變成「個案不能代表通則」？
保有過去美好之物──秩序（1） 理解保守主義的精神，首重理解「秩序」這個詞。 我們中文圈的人，對於歐美思想中的秩序一詞，在理解上欠缺內在核心的意義，非常容易望文生義，想像秩序只是一種表面規範。 秩序卻是保守主義一切的根本，所謂的重視傳統、標榜緩進的改革，道理都是在秩序兩字。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Conservatism/%E9%A1%98%E6%99%AF%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%9D%E7%AA%81/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Conservatism/%E9%A1%98%E6%99%AF%E7%9A%84%E8%A1%9D%E7%AA%81/</guid><description>tags: #📝️/🌲️ Ref: A Conflict of Visions
湯瑪斯·索維爾在《 A Conflict of Visions》直指兩種截然不同的、看待人類社會的根本觀點：「有限觀 (Constraind Vision)」與「無限觀 (Unconstraind Vision)」。這兩種觀點顯示了人們在意識形態、政經議題上的關鍵分歧，是源自對人性基本假設的根本差異。
「有限觀」認為人類有著難以改變的自私天性，所以我們應該嚴謹地遵循受到時間考驗的傳統及證據，尋求系統性（而非破壞性）的社會進步。在「有限觀」的世界裡，設計並維持一套能讓每個自私的機構和個人相互制衡的社會制度（諸如權力分立制度、自由市場），遠比崇拜權威、盲從個人經驗、或期待所有人都能拋棄自私天性還要可靠得多，更別說要我們相信政府真的具備必要的德性與才能去管理擴及整個國家的許多龐雜事務。
相對地，索維爾認為秉持「無限觀」的人經常執迷於「人性本善」的理念，所以不願意信任權力分立、去中心化的繁冗過程，也對限制人類行動的大型機構和系統性過程感到不耐煩。他們更傾向於相信問題有更理想、更大刀闊斧的解決方案，而不願接受由社會上每個個人依據自身條件去選擇、權衡、妥協的自然結果。在政治上，他們相信少數夠有遠見的人有能力和資格為社會大眾做決策，由中央當局實施的改革去塑造一個更好的社會、並決定傳統和過時思想的存廢。
顯而易見地，「有限觀」對人性是悲觀的，因此更相信系統性、去中心化、一步一腳印的集體進程，也尊敬引領人類走到今天的文化根基；「無限觀」則以理想主義看待人性，所以相信具有遠見和道德高度的人有資格引領並改變世界，更有責任剷除文化或體制中的敗壞陳腐。
「有限觀」代表了秩序，他提供人們穩定、安全感、社會運作的默契、以及生命的已知藍圖；「無限觀」代表了混沌，他帶來機會、創新、改革、自由解放、以及生命的更多可能。秩序的僵化會導致壓迫、盲從，剝奪人的自由、安康、創造力，混沌的失控則會導致暴力、混亂，使社會喪失和睦、默契、向心力。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/Why-Socrates-Hated-Democracy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/Why-Socrates-Hated-Democracy/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 aliases: ref: https://youtube.com/watch?v=fLJBzhcSWTk

Highlights “我認為，”SSC 寫道，“最廣闊、最無形的巨大無形之物就是技術進步。 ” 例如，他認為印刷機促成了新教改革、報紙、文藝復興、科學革命和民族主義的興起。 馬丁路德、達芬奇和以撒牛頓爵士都是傀儡。 印刷機是巨大的無形之物。 在發明之後，所有其他事情都註定要發生，無論最終是誰將它們變為現實。 “因此，歷史上最大的變化是對不同技術條件的預定反應。” 在這種觀點下，技術進步奠定了基礎，其他一切都在發揮其腳本作用。 ( View Highlight) 技術進步可能會在時代之間、過去的方式和未來的方式之間劃出更清晰的界限。 ( View Highlight) 變革過程分為三個階段： • 分離：個人、團體或社會秩序被剝奪了先前定義的身份和地位的時期。 • 閾限期：迷失方向的非結構或反結構時期，開闢了新的可能性，不再基於舊的地位或權力等級制度。 探索新的身份並考慮新的可能性。 • 重新定向：個人、群體或社會秩序採用新身份、獲得新地位並設計更適合新身份的新結構的改革時期。 無論我們是進入第四次轉折、一場大型戰爭、生活在一個有限的空間，還是三者兼而有之，越來越明顯的是，我們正在走向另一邊的新事物。 ( View Highlight) 我們正在走向一個在各個方面都更加去中心化的時代——地緣政治、金融、教育、新聞和能源等等——由技術驅動，包括但不限於互聯網。 這個新的去中心化時代將需要新的基礎設施和組織原則，以適應去中心化系統固有的混亂和複雜性。 ( View Highlight) 我們越能在大規模範圍內進行交流，我們的物種就越能像一個單一的有機體一樣發揮作用，以人類的集體知識塔為大腦，每個人的大腦就像體內的神經或肌肉纖維。 隨著大眾傳播時代的到來，集體人類有機體——人類巨人——應運而生。 ( View Highlight) 人類歷史可以被視為我們組織自己以滿足基本需求並試圖超越這些需求的方式的歷史。 ( View Highlight) 與我們今天的組織方式相比，人類在史前時期的組織方式是多種多樣的、創造性的和靈活的。 即便如此，我們還是在中心化和去中心化之間搖擺不定。 作者著手回答這個問題，「不平等從何而來？ “最後反而問，”我們是怎麼被困住的？ ” Graeber 和 Wengrow 認為人類失去了我們遠古祖先享有的三種自由： 離開或搬離周圍環境的自由 不服從他人命令的自由 塑造全新社會現實或在不同社會現實之間來回轉換的自由 作者指出，重要的是，前兩種自由“通常充當第三種更具創造性的自由的腳手架”。 搬遷和不服從命令的權利賦予了人們試驗社會現實的自由。 ( View Highlight) Graeber 和 Wengrow 不同意 SSC 將技術進步視為巨大無形之物，他們寫道： 選擇相反的方式來描述歷史，即一系列突如其來的技術革命，每一次都伴隨著我們成為自己創造物的長期囚徒，這是有後果的。 歸根結底，這是一種將我們這個物種表現得比實際證明的更缺乏思想、更缺乏創造力、更不自由的方式。 這意味著不把歷史描述為一系列連續不斷的新思想和創新，無論是技術的還是其他的，在此期間，不同的社區集體決定他們認為哪些技術適合應用於日常目的，哪些技術僅限於實驗或儀式遊戲領域。 當然，技術創造力對社會創造力更是如此&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; 在人類歷史上，儀式遊戲區域一次又一次地充當了社會實驗的場所——甚至在某些方面，它是一部關於社會可能性的百科全書。 我認為我剛剛分享的圖表，無論畫得多麼糟糕，都可以解決這兩個論點。 人們應該能夠在沙盒中進行實驗和玩耍，以發現風險較低的新技術和社交工具（所有小點），但肯定有一個總體形狀，因為一些技術和社會結構以 Vast Formless Things（正弦波）為主。 那麼，我們不是偶人，而是實驗主義者。 無論史前史的事實將我們引向現代史，事實仍然是現代社會建立在等級結構中，處於不斷變化的中心化程度，以實現越來越複雜的事物。 ( View Highlight)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟨 aliases: Ref: https://consilienceproject.org/taiwans-digital-democracy/

2020年，臺灣對COVID-19大流行的極其有效的應對措施贏得了國際讚譽：該國當年總共僅遭受了7例COVID死亡，並迅速恢復了日常生活的正常狀態，而世界其他地區仍處於封鎖狀態。臺灣的成功因其前所未有的治理技術而備受讚譽，這些技術將技術與民主權力下放相結合，一些評論員將該國稱為西方效仿的典範。[1][2]但臺灣在這方面的成功並非僥倖。相反，這些能力來自臺灣政府長期以來的開放心態，即根據最新技術進步所帶來的能力，重塑其政府機構和整體戰略態勢。
Taiwan’s success drew plaudits for its unprecedented governance techniques that blended technology with democratic decentralization, with some commentators citing the nation as a model for the West to emulate.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E6%84%9B%E6%B2%99%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9E%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E6%84%9B%E6%B2%99%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9E%E7%9A%84%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟨 aliases: REF https://futurecity.cw.com.tw/article/251?rec=i2i&amp;from_id=2327&amp;from_index=1
愛沙尼亞的網路發展 愛沙尼亞人口131萬，距離極權大國俄羅斯，從首都塔林到俄羅斯邊界的金吉利普，開車只要三小時；而俄羅斯同中國，公認擁有實力強大的駭客網軍。
1992年獨立的愛沙尼亞，成為全球數位經濟爭相學習的對象。愛沙尼亞是網路電話Skype的故鄉。Skype創業者高價賣給eBay後，賺了第一桶金繁衍不息，孕育與投資了更多新創。愛沙尼亞人口只有0.3%在高科技產業工作，卻貢獻了全國大部分的經濟。在數位安全、自由度都名列前茅。
推動數位化 愛沙尼亞走上數位之路，其實是受到芬蘭的刺激。愛沙尼亞在納入蘇聯前，曾短暫獨立過，那時他們與芬蘭所得水準差不多。然後，冷戰讓兩國分屬兩個陣營，90年代芬蘭比愛沙尼亞有錢八倍。愛沙尼亞當時連家用電話都不普及，芬蘭卻有諾基亞。
愛沙尼亞早在90年代中期，愛沙尼亞就推動中學生寫程式；與私部門合作，自鄉下建立網路中心，教中老年人上網。
除了推動小學生學程式，愛沙尼亞也跳過傳統基礎建設、優先打造數位基礎建設的靈魂人物。
如今，愛沙尼亞1500種服務都架在數位基礎建設X-Road平台上，不論人在那裡，都可以用數位身分證，加上數位簽章網上進行。數位簽章可用瞳孔辨識。三分之一的人網路投票。唯一必須本人現身的只有三件事，第一是結婚，第二是離婚，第三是買土地。
如何打造數位國 現在科技是一種很廉價，大家都可以做的事情。問題是，一個國家有沒有政治意志，如果你有，就會去制定政策，有政策就可以讓你去推動法律。在民主社會，有法律就有框架、法規、規範去管控一切。然後，你要有一個安全、健全的識別系統，在安全的架構下，提供大家想要的服務。
資料完整性 比起把數位治理的討論重點放在隱私權，**資料完整度與正確性（Integrity）**要更重要。
隱私是個文化接受度的問題，即使在歐盟，法國、德國的隱私權要求就比北歐高。歐洲特別重視隱私，但這是弄錯焦點：關鍵不只是誰能不能看，重點應該是不能讓任何人能竄改他。 因為越來越仰賴資料的新時代，竄改可能致命，陷人於罪，譬如血型、銀行帳戶等。
以2016美國大選為例，俄國駭入民主黨希拉蕊助理的郵箱，他們不僅偷了資料，更關鍵是串改了內容，然後公布假電郵。這才是真正的大問題。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟨 aliases: ref: https://futurecity.cw.com.tw/article/2715
個資保護的兩種架構——GDPR vs CBPR 談到資料治理的法律問題，最常被討論的是個資保護與資料治理之間如何並存；我國在討論個資保護時，經常將此視為天賦人權的一種，似乎是不可質疑的前提。
其實，「個資保護」概念直到1980年代才出現，因當時電腦科技出現，個人資料變得容易複製流通，才有應賦予個人對其資料有自主控制權的觀念，藉此保護20世紀初以來逐漸受重視的個人隱私權。
然而，此觀念主要由歐盟加以制度化，並推廣於其他國家，至今卻仍未成為美國的主流法政策。
主因在於，美國是以「維持隱私權」此一較傳統的觀念為主。在隱私權模式下，個人對其資料並無自主控制權，個人相關資訊的流通，應以社會生活合理界線為準，是否構成侵害隱私，要由個案情境進行認定。歐盟推動的個資保護法制，則是以相對明確的程序規定作為合法與否的判斷。簡言之，就是當事人事前同意，或有法律規定依據，才是合法進行個資蒐集處理利用。
Comment: 可參考[[普通法系]]
美國與歐盟在此一法制上的歧異，衍生出在國際上兩大架構，一是以歐盟的「個人資料保護基本規則」（GDPR），另一為美國主導的「跨境隱私規則」（CBPR），後者強調在數位時代資料跨境傳輸應盡量不受限制。應注意的是，我國在APEC架構下已加入CBPR架構，近期並加入了「全球跨境隱私規則論壇」（Global CBPR Forum），將共同推動CBPR的全球化。
強調個人對其資料的自主控制權，表面上很符合當代重視個人自主選擇的思維；但GDPR的實際運作結果卻顯示，以個人同意為前提的資料蒐集利用，其實對數位平台巨頭來說輕而易舉——因為，網路使用者為了使用平台的免費服務，往往輕易就點選同意相關使用條款；相對地，新創小型業者要獲得當事人同意提供個資就困難得多。因此，GDPR反助長了數位經濟的大者恆大效應。
資料透明公開，有助民主互信及抵禦分化 另一方面，在公共議題上，個人若能自由選擇是否提供資料，許多公共資料庫將會變得殘缺不全，或至少在提供外部研究利用時會是如此。結果將導致，除非我們將所有涉及公共利益的資料利用型態都立法給予法律依據，否則無法利用；這不僅對公共政策的資料治理非常不利，更會造成社會資本的侵蝕。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E5%BC%8F%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E8%88%87%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Democracy/%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E5%BC%8F%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E8%88%87%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟨 aliases: 唐鳳談開放政府 ref: https://futurecity.cw.com.tw/article/2327
開放式創新 開放式創新（Open Innovation），即每個人的創新奠基在已有的成果上，但不受著作權、專利權或市場商標等影響，可以自己做出更好的版本，也能因地制宜。
於是每個人都可能提出或創造更好的作法，像LINE掃碼功能推出後，用疾管家掃碼的人就少很多了，因為較不方便。又如簡訊實聯制，除APP的使用外，亦可使用紙本。有人甚至發展出概連續章等方法，比掃碼還快。要求所有人用手機、下載APP，是極不現實的。
舊系統不會讓新的沒辦法發生，而新的發生時又不會經過各種限制、讓更新的沒辦法發生——這就是開放式創新的好處。
不同層級的公民參與 每個人都有自己的事要做，也不必在這裡花上全部時間；重點是，我們能不能在事情發生時，在這裡集結願意貢獻心力的人。像維基百科有很多人看，但真正會編輯的人沒那麽多；但是，當你知道有維基百科，需要查資料、做作業時，就可以運用。
最後這會像一個緩坡，你有兩、三分鐘可以投入，那就可以聽未來城市的Podcast，大概知道有這麽一回事；等到你有20分鐘，也許你可以看共筆，順便打幾個字、改幾個錯字；你有兩個小時、兩天、兩個月的時間時，都各自有不同的事可以做。
任何人都可以投入，因為每個人都是公共服務的利害關係人，只要他有時間，就可以投入。
其實，公務員下班就是公民，甚至是鄉民。他下班後也可以去PTT提出政府改革訴求，或藉此改善公務員基本工作權益。又像是報稅軟體的改造討論，許多幫忙主持討論、連署的也不一定是財政部公務員，可能是海巡署的人——因為每個人都要報稅，他也能從民眾角度思考。
所以我的意思是，讓公務員覺得自己是公民參與的公民，而不是被參與的公務員——過去五年多的培力，大部分公務員都了解這項好處，這也是值得繼續推動的原因。
開放政府平台 「 公共政策網路參與平台」網站包含想要政策提議、附議、政府法規預告等，都能隨時提供意見，若提案獲得超過5,000票，我們就必須處理。全台2,300多萬人，但這網站到今年十月已經超過3,000萬瀏覽人次了，所以滿多人至少來看過一次。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Economics/Sacred-Economics-With-Charles-Eisenstein-A-Short-Film/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Economics/Sacred-Economics-With-Charles-Eisenstein-A-Short-Film/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 aliases: ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs&amp;ab_channel=TransparentFilm

你越了解新古典經濟學，你就越習慣於接受他們所謂的簡化假設，這實際上是幻想。如果你迅速轉向保持那種範式，那種看待世界的方式，那麼你就會得到這樣的東西並接受它。從那時起，我已經看到了很多這樣的例子，當我在一個極端展示新古典主義的兩個極端時，在另一個極端展示馬克思主義的極端。我已經向他們展示了他們的論點中的邏輯缺陷，無論是由我開發的還是由其他的人開發的，他們都會伸出手來。哦，沒關係。我們可以假設解決這個問題。史蒂夫·基恩：這確實是人類的缺陷。你變得更執著於你看待世界的方式，而不是世界本身。當你面對它之間的矛盾時，對於大多數人來說，他們都會把目光從矛盾上移開。

Bastiat發現，市場及人與人之間的交易應當足夠自由地進行，這也是一種高級的、追求慾望滿足的機制。即使初期存在著明顯的不平等，追求慾望的過程會出乎意料地消除這些不平等性，指向更高層次的、需要間接實現的目的——所有這些都是為了資本主義制度下的受益者，也就是消費者的利益。他在《和諧經濟論》（Economic Harmonies）中寫道：「必須引入競爭，因為需要競爭來改變不平等的事實。勞動力本能地朝著承諾其會得到最好回報的方向前進，所以最終必然會達到一個能夠享受超常優勢的結果；因此，不平等僅僅是一種對自身的鞭策，驅使我們走向平等。這便是目的論在現實社會中最好的例子之一。」
社會中的人們「彼此支持，為他人工作，互利互惠，運用自身能力，抑或任憑他人支配，都是為了取得回報」。個人就像國家一樣，並不是孤立的；事實上，個體的生存取決於個體間的相互作用。
Bastiat認為，私人財產權能夠得到足夠尊重，社會所有成員的利益就可以和諧共存。在他看來，政府的主要作用是維護生命安全、自由和財產，以及消除不公正。
按照Mises的看法，時間偏好是利率的唯一來源——等待和放棄眼前的利潤（或消費），甚至資本流失（比如通過昂貴的資本支出），是我們人性中合乎邏輯的一部份——事實上，為了做某些有益的事，我們必須克服人性的一部份（這些事情累積起來就相當於文明的進步）。
……放棄直接獲利的途徑，採取較困難和迂迴的路徑，暫時的虧損是一個中間步驟，是為了將來得到更大的潛在優勢。由於這樣做非常難，因此它仍然是一條少有人選擇的迂回曲折的路。這和我們的作法如此不同，與對時間的認知反差距大。
我們必須改變認知維度，從當下改為中期，從即期改為跨期。這需要一種堅定的、脫離眼前正在發生的、可見的事物的前瞻性，轉向即將到來的、現在還無法看到的事物。Mark Spitznagel稱此新的視角為「景深」（使用時間上的光學術語而不是空間的術語），我們能夠敏銳地感知更久遠的未來時間。
這並不像某些人想像的那樣，是從短線思維轉向長線思維。所謂長線，不過是陳詞濫調，而且經常本身都充滿了矛盾：為了長期目的而採取行動，通常需要有一個當下的承諾，它基於可選擇的機會集合的一個短線觀點，等待在一段時間之後出現的結果——通常在這段延長期裡，人們對跨期機會缺乏充分考量或區分。（更有甚者，說一個人在按長線操作，經常是為一件事沒有按計畫發生而找的藉口。）長線是遠視，短線是近視；景深則介於這兩者之間。所以我們不必考慮長線或短線。正如克里普悖論，我們應該從完全不同的角度看待時間——跨期，其中包含了一系列的「當下」時刻，環環相扣。
老子「是謂微明，柔弱勝剛強。」時間不是外生，而是內生的，是一切事物的基礎因素——而耐心是最寶貴的財富。漢學家Roger Ames和David Hall將「道」說成是「做的方法」「過程性的」（他們稱做「動詞型形容詞」），延續一段時間的「焦點認知和現場認知」，這就是景深，我們通過這個概念，探索配置、環境和系統中蘊藏的潛力。
對於老子而言，大部分的外部世界都只是帶來了來自外部的分散注意力，大部分認知都是對一個隱藏的事實的發散性認知——而這其實更需要人們集中注意力。用《老子》中更準確的話說，就是「不出戶知天下；不窺牖見天道。其出彌遠，其知彌少。」
Paul Carus在其1913年版的《The Canon of Reason and Virtue: Being Lao-tze&amp;rsquo;s Tao Teh King》中，將老子的認識論與18世紀德國哲學家康德相提並論：「老子贊同康德的先驗學說，也就是說，某些真理可以被先驗地表述，即在我們獲得實際體驗之前。並非每個人都瞭解人類自身，但是思想家可以。為了瞭解太陽的化學成分，我們無須登上太陽；我們可以用光譜法分析陽光。我們無需用可伸縮的卷尺度量地球到月球的距離，我們可以用一種先驗科學的方法（三角學）算出來。」</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Economics/The-Misuse-of-Mathematics-in-Economics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Economics/The-Misuse-of-Mathematics-in-Economics/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 URL: https://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2022/12/08/the-misuse-of-mathematics-in-economics/

Highlights 除了減少給定用途所需的量之外，提高效率還降低了使用資源的相對成本，從而增加了所需的數量。這在一定程度上抵消了使用效率的降低。此外，提高效率可加速經濟增長，進一步增加資源需求。Jevons的悖論發生在增加需求的影響佔主導地位時，效率更高導致更多的資源被使用。 ( View Highlight) 反彈效應的大小取決於物品需求的價格彈性。 ( View Highlight) 傑文斯警告說，燃油效率的提高往往會增加燃料使用量。但這並不意味著提高燃油效率是毫無價值的：更高的燃油效率可以實現更高的生產和更高的生活品質。 ( View Highlight)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Energy-Climate/Michael-Shellenberger-Why-renewables-cant-save-the-planet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Energy-Climate/Michael-Shellenberger-Why-renewables-cant-save-the-planet/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 aliases: ref: https://youtube.com/watch?v=N-yALPEpV4w
太陽能屋頂的電力成本大約是太陽能農場所發電力的兩倍。且太陽能農場和風力發電場都需要以太陽能電池板或風力渦輪機覆蓋大量的土地，更需要建設非常大的供電線路，將電力從郊外輸入城市。這些建設往往都受到當地社區的強烈抵制，也被擔心野生鳥類及其他動物的保育生物學家所抵制。
風力渦輪機，會殺死老鷹、貓頭鷹、禿鷹、及其他大型鳥類和瀕危物種，事實上，它們是這些大型鳥類的最大生存威脅之一。
至於太陽能，其實建造太陽能農場就跟建造其他型態的農場很像，我們必須清除整個區域的野生動物。以加州最大的太陽能農場Ivanpah來說，為了建造這個農場，人們必須清除整片區域的沙漠陸龜，意味著他們得將沙漠陸龜和牠們的孩子從洞穴中一隻隻拖出來、搬上小卡車、送去人工飼育的地方——其中有許多陸龜並未活下來。
隨著時間推移，我逐漸意識到，基本上沒有任何技術革新能夠讓太陽更規律地照耀、或讓風更可靠地吹拂。我們可以讓太陽能電池更便宜、讓風力渦輪機更大，但陽光和風終究是相當稀缺的能源。要靠它們生產大量的電力，就必須讓這些設施覆蓋非常大面積的土地。換句話說，再生能源的所有大問題都不是技術問題，而是自然成因。
假如德國把他花在再生能源的5800億美元花在核電上，他們就會有百分之百的用電都是來自乾淨能源。
英國醫學雜誌Lancet做的最新研究指出核電是最安全的；根據世界衛生組織的數據，每年約有700萬人死於空氣污染，而核電不會排放這些有害物質；氣候科學家James Hansen於是估計到目前為止，核電已經挽救了將近200萬條的人命。
核廢料，事實上是所有發電方式中唯一被安全控制、儲存的廢料，其他每一種發電方式都將廢料直接排放到自然環境中，要不直接造成污染，要不變成廢棄物。
許多人以為太陽能板是乾淨無毒的，但事實是，在太陽能板的20至25年使用壽命結束後，我們沒有任何計畫來處理它們。許多專家實際上都很擔心這些太陽能板將被運往非洲或亞洲的貧窮國家、和其他的電子垃圾一起被拆解，讓這些人暴露在非常高含量的有毒物質中，包括鉛、鎘和鉻。正因為這些是元素，它們的毒素永遠不會隨著時間而減低。
對於我們當中非常關注氣候變遷的人，採取過於浪漫的解決方案——比如利用再生能源使人類文明與大自然和平共處——來處理這麼巨大的環境問題，顯然是很自然的、容易被理解的。但隨著更多證據的出現，許多人已經開始質疑原先的信念、改變原本的想法。對我來說現在的問題是，既然我們已經知道再生能源無法拯救地球，我們是否要繼續放任它產生破壞呢？</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Energy-Climate/The-Modern-World-Cant-Exist-Without-These-Four-Ingredients.-They-All-Require-Fossil-Fuels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Energy-Climate/The-Modern-World-Cant-Exist-Without-These-Four-Ingredients.-They-All-Require-Fossil-Fuels/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟩 aliases: ref: https://time.com/6175734/reliance-on-fossil-fuels/

Personal Note 經濟現況：能源盲、債務驅動著消費導向的經濟型態、政府以貨幣政策等諸多措施干預自由市場、實以預支未來能源創造當下的帳面經濟成長（GDP）和短期的表象穩定、鼓勵奢侈/享樂生活型態、以稅收懲罰生產力與創新、通貨膨脹侵蝕貨幣的實際購買力
導正後的經濟遠景：支付正確的能源價碼（以供給、需求、及投入能源計價）、以儲蓄和創新為核心美德、以去中心化的絕對有限貨幣（BTC）為所有價格進行正確的能源標價（有限貨幣將與有限能源重新建立正確的掛勾）、人透過犧牲當下酬賞或為他人創造價值來獲得「真正的」經濟成長（累積真正的購買力或透過創新來提升購買力）、缺乏短期的「穩定」經濟成長但將出現無預期（但不意外）的科技革新以提升人類生活和購買力、人的購買力將因貨幣與能源掛勾而波動、進而引發人們思考並僅為真正迫切的需求買單、降低人們不必要的奢侈/享樂生活型態、使人們再次重視生命中有價值且免費的事物（人際關係、意義等）、移除懲罰生產力與創新的稅收（事物的價格已經與能源綁定故正確定價）、通貨膨脹將僅受限於供給（能源的投入）並刺激人們的生活型態選擇和科技革新

今天，我想反思一下氣候變化，不是關於氣候變化的科學，而是關於全球變暖問題和我們的未來的不同認識階段。我不能歸類每個人都遵循同樣的順序，但這個階段的順序大致是我在自己的生活中遵循的。而且我認為嘗試解釋為什麼很多人使用氣候變化這個詞很重要，但他們的解決方案和解決方案以及他們的希望和乾預措施卻大相徑庭。 Today, I would like to give a reflection about climate change, not about the science of climate change, but about the different stages of awareness when it comes to the issue of global warming and our future.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Life-Morality/Jordan-Peterson-and-Dave-Rubin-Live-in-Sydney/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Life-Morality/Jordan-Peterson-and-Dave-Rubin-Live-in-Sydney/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 aliases: ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZBKmx52eas&amp;list=WL&amp;index=10&amp;t=10s&amp;ab_channel=JohnAnderson
whenpeople are in relationships of trustharmony and progress can be made when it breaks down harmony and progress areimpaired and people flee for safety ifyou don&amp;rsquo;t feel safe with someone elseyou look for the rule book and you lookfor policing and you&amp;rsquo;ll look forprotection ( View Highlight) the redemption ofthe world is not political it happens atthe level of the individual ( View Highlight) what we gotfundamentally right in the West becausethere is a number of things we gotfundamentally right even though we don&amp;rsquo;tlike to admit that anymore is that theultimate moral responsibility for thestate relies on you it relies on yourmoral integrity ( View Highlight) first of all you have theright and the responsibility to vote andwe could say well that&amp;rsquo;s not exactlygiven to you by the state it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;ssomething that exists in some in somesense outside and before the state it&amp;rsquo;spart and parcel of your intrinsic value ( View Highlight) so that&amp;rsquo;s a decision that we&amp;rsquo;vemade in the West that each personregardless of their flaws ischaracterized by a value an intrinsic value that&amp;rsquo;s so deep and so profoundthat the very regulation of the stateitself rests on their shoulders ( View Highlight) it&amp;rsquo;s thedispersal of responsibility who wantsall that responsibility but there&amp;rsquo;s ahuge price to be paid for it ( View Highlight) thefirst price that you pay for it is wellthere goes the adventure of your lifeit&amp;rsquo;s like you could get yourselftogether and be the bedrock of the stateright that&amp;rsquo;d be hard that call oneverything that you have that would beyour adventure you&amp;rsquo;re gonna pass thatoff to someone else and then then whatdo you do you&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing left inyour life a triviality ( View Highlight) I don&amp;rsquo;t believe thatpeople can live ethically triviallythat&amp;rsquo;s why I think the pursuit of theidea that life is for happiness is wrongbecause life is too difficult for thatto be the case our lives are tooprofound to characterized by sufferingand malevolence the world is toocharacterized by trouble at every levelfor happiness to be the proper solutionthe solution is something like a heavy burden of ethical responsibility thekind that sets the state straight andthen in that you find the purpose ofyour life ( View Highlight) so not only if you wantthe external monitoring and thesurveillance state not only do yousacrifice your privacy and invite allthat invasive attention and lose yourimpulsive freedom you lose everythingthat&amp;rsquo;s profound about your life andsomeone takes it from you they take your destiny from you and that&amp;rsquo;s no way tolive ( View Highlight) evenunder terrible circumstances there were ways of being more or less noble and Isuppose it would be under terriblecircumstances where that sort of thingwould be put to the test ( View Highlight) itreally made him think about his own rolein his own demise ( View Highlight) Solzhenitsyn noted thatthere were people even under these extreme circumstances that would tellthe truth and he decided that he wouldgo over his life with a fine-tooth combhe had nothing but time to think aboutevery time he had acted in some mannerin his life that transgressed againsthis own conscience right that where hedid something he knew to be wrong andthen to see if he could figure out howto set it right then now obviously hecouldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily apologize to thepeople against who he had transgressedright sometimes you have to pay for something you did in a currency otherthan that which you took and hisdetermination was to chronicle hisexperiences in his truthful manner aspossible which was basically impossible ( View Highlight) so hebasically memorized the book and it&amp;rsquo;s2,400 pages long of 8-point type likeit&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s a it&amp;rsquo;s one remarkable workit&amp;rsquo;s one long scream of truthful outrageyou know and that came out of hisdecision to set himself right and then it was as John said it was smuggled intothe West where it had a walloping impactit completely demolished at least for along while the moral credibility ofcommunism completely from like 1972 onif you knew about the existence of theGulag Archipelago you didn&amp;rsquo;t get tosay anything good about communism andthat lasted for a long time it evenconvinced French intellectuals thatthere was something wrong with communismand there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that it was one ofthe historical events that caused the Soviet Union to collapse ( View Highlight) you thinkwell what power do you have if you&amp;rsquo;rewilling to tell the truth it&amp;rsquo;s not easyto tell the truth it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s complicatedyou have to take yourself into accountright over the long run you have to takeyour family into account you have totake your society into account you haveto think it through you have to thinkstrategically and then you have to findyour words and that&amp;rsquo;s hard to find yourwords because you tend to use otherpeople&amp;rsquo;s words or ideological words orwords that mask or hide it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to find your own words but if you find yourown words and there are truthful wordsthere isn&amp;rsquo;t anything that can stop them ( View Highlight) youhave the power of your convictions inyour truth and your ability tocommunicate and that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s supposedto set the state straight ( View Highlight) maybe it&amp;rsquo;s truth that you&amp;rsquo;re pursuingand seeking if you have any sense andwhat truth well truth is the bestreflection you can manage of realityimperfect because you&amp;rsquo;re imperfect butit&amp;rsquo;s the best you&amp;rsquo;ve got it&amp;rsquo;s like whatwhat&amp;rsquo;s gonna be better for you than tohave reality on your side and what&amp;rsquo;sgonna stand in your way if you havereality on your side ( View Highlight) if you believed infalsehood it&amp;rsquo;s like good get on with itman you could be a criminal and lay yourlife out and see how that works and ifyou believe in truth well then perhapsyou put yourself on the line for thetruth ( View Highlight) but you don&amp;rsquo;t play the the two sides against the middle because there&amp;rsquo;sthere&amp;rsquo;s nothing in that that isn&amp;rsquo;tself-serving at the cost of your ownwell-being and at the cost of everyoneelse&amp;rsquo;s ( View Highlight) most people whotrust are naive and naive is not a virtue it&amp;rsquo;s a fault it&amp;rsquo;s partly a faultbecause if you&amp;rsquo;re naive and you run intosomeone who&amp;rsquo;s malevolent including youthey might do you incalculable damage sothat you will never recoverso that&amp;rsquo;s not a good thing you don&amp;rsquo;twant to be naive ( View Highlight) if you&amp;rsquo;re not naivethat means you&amp;rsquo;ve been burned once ortwice or three or four times and youknow once you&amp;rsquo;ve been burned in thatmanner well then it&amp;rsquo;s hard to trustbecause you think well why would I trustyou or me for that matter knowing fullwell that I can be betrayed and so then you&amp;rsquo;re cynical and you think that&amp;rsquo;s animprovement over being naive ( View Highlight) thisis a crucial thing to know you trustpeople because you&amp;rsquo;re courageous that&amp;rsquo;swhy it&amp;rsquo;s the same reason that you&amp;rsquo;regrateful it&amp;rsquo;s a mark of courage it&amp;rsquo;s amark of commitment it&amp;rsquo;s like you and Iwe&amp;rsquo;re gonna make an agreement and you&amp;rsquo;re full of snakes and so am i and there&amp;rsquo;slots of ways this can go sideways butwe&amp;rsquo;re going to put together an agreementwe&amp;rsquo;re gonna articulate it out we&amp;rsquo;regonna try to find something that is ofmutual benefit to both of us we&amp;rsquo;re gonnaput our hands out and shake and we&amp;rsquo;regonna try to stick to that and we&amp;rsquo;regonna risk trusting each other ( View Highlight) that&amp;rsquo;s the risk uponwhich the state is based really like Ibelieve and I think the evidence forthis is very strong by the way I don&amp;rsquo;tthink that there is any other naturalresource than trust and for trust you need courage not naivety and you go toovercome your cynicism so that you trust ( View Highlight) ifyou&amp;rsquo;re cynical about the institutionsit&amp;rsquo;s like look in the mirror becausethose institutions the corruption ofthose institutions is a direct reflection of your inability to get youract together and that&amp;rsquo;s what it means tobe a sovereign part of the Westerncommunity so it&amp;rsquo;s not someone else ( View Highlight) it&amp;rsquo;s very very difficult very very verydifficult to take a system that worksnot too badly and to do anything to itthat doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it worsemuch less to radically reconstitute itand make it better ( View Highlight) democracy is not a machine it&amp;rsquo;s a spiritin which the peculiar Christianconception that no matter what yourstation in life is each of us has aspark of the divine and every soul is ofequal value before heaven ( View Highlight) we&amp;rsquo;ve knockedout the idea that whether I agree withyou or not doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter I have torespect you because they&amp;rsquo;re a higherauthority places as much value on you ashe does on me now it seems that theproblem is that if you dare disagreewith me I don&amp;rsquo;t have a reference framefor good and bad anymore or forrespecting you therefore I have to assist I&amp;rsquo;m right ( View Highlight) we lack a framework for respecting oneanother and it seems a massive problemfor us ( View Highlight) ifyour defining characteristic is thatyou&amp;rsquo;re a member of a collective then youlive or die by the propriety of the collective the the antidote to that isthat strange metaphysical claim which isthat well which is fundamentally that weeach have a spark of the Divine in us ( View Highlight) it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be cynicalabout that but youshouldn&amp;rsquo;t be because you act like it&amp;rsquo;strue and that&amp;rsquo;s worth noticing ( View Highlight) if youever say a 21 year old child and they&amp;rsquo;reupset with you they say well I&amp;rsquo;m 21years old I&amp;rsquo;m I&amp;rsquo;m able to make my own decisions and you say and they want youto agree with that and you want to agreewith it because you hope that there areready to make their own decisions andyou think well maybe they haven&amp;rsquo;tmatured to that point ( View Highlight) so what are yousayingwell you&amp;rsquo;re saying that they are giftedwith the ability to take theresponsibility to shape the realityaround them and they insist upon thatthey insist upon you recognizing that inthem as a hallmark of respect and love ( View Highlight) and you know you might be irritatedbecause they&amp;rsquo;re not acting responsiblyenough to deserve that but it&amp;rsquo;s stillwhat you hope for and want it&amp;rsquo;s so likewell so what is it we&amp;rsquo;re the sovereigncornerstone of the state ( View Highlight) what do westruggle with day to day we strugglewith the potential that&amp;rsquo;s in front of usand transforming that into the realitythat could be that&amp;rsquo;s as close to a divine faculty as anything I can thinkof it&amp;rsquo;s completely mysterious that wecan wrestle with the fabric of becomingand turn it into the actuality of beingand that we seem to do that as aconsequence of our ethical choices ( View Highlight) we have that spark of divinity it&amp;rsquo;sassociated with a deep deepresponsibility and it&amp;rsquo;sthe ability that goes along with thatand we play that out all the time weplay it out every time we play fairgames with one another we have we havedecent honest relationships with oneanother we have business arrangementsthat are honest and work and we cancooperate for long periods of time wetake care of our children properly we take care of our old people properlyit&amp;rsquo;s all predicated on the same thingyou have intrinsic value and even if youdo something terrible let&amp;rsquo;s say and Istill have the the conviction that youhave value then it&amp;rsquo;s incumbent on me tosay well you did something terrible butyou aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily somethingterrible and it might be possible foryou to shed that and to atone and torejoin those who good and that&amp;rsquo;ssomething to and it&amp;rsquo;s built deeply into our political and economic and justicesystems and it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s no time to beabandoning this ( View Highlight) I was going to try toformulate my thoughts truthfully and thereason I decided that was because I thought that the opposite was hellishlydangerous and I really I really I reallybelieve that I truly believe that and soI&amp;rsquo;m if I say things and I think they&amp;rsquo;retrue and they get me in trouble then Ithink well that&amp;rsquo;s not as much trouble asI would have got into if I would havesaid something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t true ( View Highlight) what I&amp;rsquo;m here for is to hear thequestions and try to figure out what Ithink about them and then to say thatand then to see what happens like who the hell knows what&amp;rsquo;s gonna happenbut there&amp;rsquo;s here&amp;rsquo;s an if if the world isproperly constituted through truth thenfaith is the willingness to have faithin truth ( View Highlight) you say what you believe tobe the truth and then you have the faiththat no matter what happens if you&amp;rsquo;vesaidwhat you believe to be truth whateverhappens is the best thing that couldhave happened and I believe that I thinkthat&amp;rsquo;s how the world&amp;rsquo;s constituted ( View Highlight) if you tell the truth that means you&amp;rsquo;rerevealing your being that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;redoing when you&amp;rsquo;re telling the truth andwhen you when you reveal your being thenyou&amp;rsquo;re you&amp;rsquo;re living in the world you&amp;rsquo;rethere you&amp;rsquo;re present right your your your

gonna justify your lifethe adventure it&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be easy butman if you hide from your truth wellthen you hide from yourself and thenyou&amp;rsquo;re not even there and then who thehell are you what are you the puppetyou&amp;rsquo;re the puppet of some coward you&amp;rsquo;rethe puppet of some dictator or somesecond-rate philosopher some idiotic idea or a bully you were afraid of ingrade six god only knows but it&amp;rsquo;s notyou living your life and then you loseyour life and you lose your soul too ( View Highlight) what&amp;rsquo;s happening Ithink on the me to end of things and the affirmative consent end of things is theold sexual taboos are reassertingthemselves the idea that we can extractsex out from emotional intimacy andespecially emotional intimacy I wouldsay psychological intimacy maybe evenfromlong-term relationship is I don&amp;rsquo;tbelieve it&amp;rsquo;s a tenable idea I don&amp;rsquo;tthink we can do it and a lot of whatwe&amp;rsquo;re seeing is the backlash againstthat ( View Highlight) we need to have a veryserious conversation about that likeunder what circumstances is itacceptable to give consent but we&amp;rsquo;re notmature enough to have that conversationwe want both ways we want to be able todo whatever we want whatever with whatwith whoever we want whenever we wantwith no consequences and we want therenever to be any trouble about consent ( View Highlight) between 20 and 30 there&amp;rsquo;sa lot of things to get straight andlong-term mate is usually one of themand most of the time people should be more careful with their sexual behaviorwhen they&amp;rsquo;re young especially whenthey&amp;rsquo;re drunk than they are ( View Highlight) despite the fact that we have reliable birth control we&amp;rsquo;re going to have torelearn what the acceptable rules ofpropriety are with regards to sexualrelationships ( View Highlight) don&amp;rsquo;t doanything physically with anyone that youwouldn&amp;rsquo;t talk to them about because ifyou&amp;rsquo;re too damn embarrassed to talkabout it well maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a littlepremature in the relationship toactually do it and then there&amp;rsquo;s harm inityou know

ref: 淺談情境主義對德性倫理學的挑戰
個人的神聖性，並不是像孟子說的人人皆可為堯舜、每個人都可以達到一樣高的高度，融會現代心理學的背景，可以知道許多人因為後天或先天的限制是不可能達到相同高度的，但重點從未是讓大家得到結果的平等，而是相信每分每秒、每個人都擁有採取自己心中的正確作為、朝生命和人格理想邁進一小步的可能性，也幾乎不可能沒有實踐這份可能性的能力，端看他是否能夠行使這份意志去成就最最微小的一個正確的步伐。
「所謂『稀少性回應』，指德性倫理學其實不必主張多數人都有德性；實則，有德者往往被當作我們應達至的理想來討論」——德性即為the process of aiming at what one could be, not the result of examining what one currently is/used to be</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Life-Morality/%E5%BF%AB%E6%A8%82%E4%B8%A6%E9%9D%9E%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%AE%E6%A8%99/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Life-Morality/%E5%BF%AB%E6%A8%82%E4%B8%A6%E9%9D%9E%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%AE%E6%A8%99/</guid><description>tags: #📝️/🌿

當無神論者提出挑戰說「為什麼愛我們的上帝會替人世間降下這麼多毫不必要、暴虐殘酷的苦難」，這是帶著主觀的「效益」眼光在看待世事。
除非透過上帝的視角，我們不可能憑個人的經驗及認知，預設那些你我不忍直視的苦難「絕對不可能」導致任何形式的良善。我們純粹不可能知道，故沒有資格做論斷。
換個角度想：今天你回到過去殺了希特勒，也無法真的確定這在更長的時間軸下一定對人類整體的福祉有幫助，畢竟，你真的能肯定不會因此開啟另一條有更多苦難的時間支線？
所以我們發現：除非我們能對一個事件進行「全時間」的「全知」評估，否則我們永遠不可能真的知道一個行為的「效益」是正是負。
這不是昧於良知，而是對個人的有限智識和主觀經驗保持謙卑。
再者，我們本來就不應該用「好結果」去反推一個決定是「好決定」，因為好決定不一定會有好結果，壞決定也可能因為運氣而導致好結果——這應該是每個人在生命中都可以輕鬆驗證的道理。
另一方面，只求好結果而不求合理、正義的手段及過程，那就是為暴政鋪路：如果我們輕易認定自己堅持的正義是絕對正確、且值得不擇手段達到的，就難保有一天自己不會成為正義之名下「不擇手段」的犧牲者。
這點出了「程序正義」的意義，也是為什麼我們應該思辯道德的定義。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Philosophy/David-Bohm-on-Perception/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Philosophy/David-Bohm-on-Perception/</guid><description>tags: #♻ aliases: ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mst3fOl5vH0&amp;ab_channel=nanotuber

犬儒主義（希臘語：κυνισμός，英語：Cynicism）是對他人的動機從根本上不信任的一種心理態度[1]。奉行犬儒主義的人通常對其他受野心、欲望、貪婪、物質主義、目標所驅使的人不抱有希望，同時反對將抱負、慾望、貪欲、刺激、功利等作為自己的生活動力（犬儒主義者認為這些都是徒勞，不可實現或毫無意義），因此他們也拒絕財富、權力和榮譽。
當代的犬儒主義被定義為一種對倫理及社會風俗採取不信任的態度，而大眾社會中那些拒絕被收編的人也常常被稱作是憤世嫉俗的犬儒主義者。這並不表示犬儒主義是消極無奈的。如果說唯心論是理想領導經驗，那麼當代的犬儒主義就是接受並跟隨現實經驗。當代犬儒主義是一種「以不相信來獲得合理性」的社會文化形態。犬儒主義者的徹底不相信表現在：不相信別人的熱情，不相信別人的義正辭嚴，不相信有所謂正義的呼喊，他們甚至不相信還能有什麼辦法改變他們所不相信的那個世界。他們把對現有秩序的不滿，轉化為一種「不拒絕的冷漠」、一種「不反抗的清醒」、一種「不認同的接受」，獨善其身，只要自己不受傷害即可。「既然世界是如此大荒謬，大玩笑，我亦惟有以荒謬和玩笑對待之。」
現代的犬儒主義者和懷疑論者有許多相似之處，不同的是犬儒主義者認為對錯「無所謂」，而懷疑論者認為「根本就沒有」正確與錯誤之分。
「犬儒治世」指的是現代專制和極權化國家/社會的背景出現的一種知識分子階層社會文化現象。密爾早就指出，專制使人變成犬儒（這使人聯想起王夫之的話：「其上申韓者，其下必佛老」）。在前蘇聯史達林中後期所奉行的高壓政策是一種極端的專制，因此它更會使人變成犬儒。在專制下，統治者與被統治者都容易變成犬儒。統治者變成犬儒，因為他們早就不相信他們口頭上宣講的那套理論和原則，他們只把那些理論和原則當做維護權力的手段以及鎮壓反抗的藉口。在被統治者方面，當他們一旦意識到自己在冠冕堂皇的旗幟下實際上處於被愚弄被壓迫的境地，很容易轉而對一切美好的價值失去信心。尤其是在試圖反抗又遭到嚴重的挫折之後。這樣，他們就可能放棄理想，放棄追求，甚至反過來嘲笑理想，嘲笑追求——吃不著葡萄就說葡萄酸。這樣，他們就變成了犬儒。當然，統治者的犬儒主義和被統治者的犬儒主義是有所不同的，但是廣義地講，它們都可以歸入犬儒主義。
按照歐文·豪的分析：極權主義有三個階段，（一）、烏托邦，令人心醉神迷的天堂理想，它誘發了狂熱，而狂熱則導致了（二）大規模的恐怖和人間地獄，然後，狂熱與恐怖被耗盡，於是，（三）、人們變得玩世不恭，「看透一切」，政治冷感，即犬儒主義。[來源請求] 胡平（《北京之春》主編）以為極權主義有四個階段，在狂熱和恐怖之後常常還發生過反抗，在反抗受挫之後才會出現普遍的犬儒主義。極權統治靠人們的狂熱而建立，通過大規模的恐怖而得以鞏固，但是，狂熱和恐怖都不可能持久，最後是靠著人們的消沉與冷漠，極權統治才得以維繫。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Productivity/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-10-Principles-to-Revolutionize-Your-Note-Taking-and-Writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Productivity/How-to-Take-Smart-Notes-10-Principles-to-Revolutionize-Your-Note-Taking-and-Writing/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟨 URL: https://fortelabs.com/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/

work is a form of sacrifice and vice versa and that because you sacrifice the present to the Future at least but you also sacrifice everything to your highest priority if you&amp;rsquo;re not confused and then that brings up the question of what the highest priority should be and what the quality of the sacrifice should be and the answer to that psychologically is it should be the highest possible quality sacrifice to the highest possible thing because you otherwise you have to ask yourself why would you bother doing it ( View Highlight) if your conscience is functioning well basically what it does is indicate to you constantly that your sacrifices are either not of the right sort or they&amp;rsquo;re not of the highest quality and you call yourself out on that ( View Highlight) if you try to escape from that it just makes it worse for you and you know that and you really can&amp;rsquo;t escape from it not except by abiding by it ( View Highlight) if the prayer is proper is you&amp;rsquo;re saying there&amp;rsquo;s part of me that needs to go there&amp;rsquo;s part of me that needs I need to let go there&amp;rsquo;s part of me that needs to die and it has to begiven up to something higher what part of it is of me has to go and that&amp;rsquo;s there&amp;rsquo;s a contemplative aspect to that and you look to the highest to help guide you in that so there&amp;rsquo;s a discriminating Spirit within you that can help separate the chaff from the wheat and the offering up of the chaff is the sacrificial gesture and so that can be transformed into prayer ( View Highlight) one of the things that Jung would say about that for example is that if you if you give up enough psychologically you don&amp;rsquo;t have to you you&amp;rsquo;ll you&amp;rsquo;ll cut your losses in actuality ( View Highlight)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Religion/%E5%B0%BC%E9%87%87%E8%AB%96%E5%9F%BA%E7%9D%A3%E6%95%99/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Religion/%E5%B0%BC%E9%87%87%E8%AB%96%E5%9F%BA%E7%9D%A3%E6%95%99/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥

Highlights 在談尼采對基督教的批判前必須先提到柏拉圖，因為尼采視柏拉圖為「先於基督的基督徒」[45]。柏拉圖把世界劃分為有缺陷的「感官世界」和完美的「理形世界」，這個概念後來被基督教接收，就成了「人間」和「天國」、「上帝」對立的想法。尼采直斥道：「哲學已經被神學家的血液敗壞，……實在已經被降為單純的現象，而一種虛構的世界卻被尊為實在。」[46]，在尼采看來，我們現在所處的這個世界才是唯一真實的，而所謂上帝、天國只是跟空洞虛假的概念，他寫道：「上帝、靈魂不朽、拯救、超越，這些只是觀念，我並不注意這些，也從不在這上面浪費時間。」[47]。而塑造出這種想法的背後則是由對生命的厭棄所推動的。尼采稱其為「褻瀆大地」[48]、頹廢。基督教把生命存在的價值寄託在來世的救贖，尼采也譴責這種看待生命的方式，「當一個人把他生活的重心不放在生活本身而放在『來世』——放在虛無中——那麼，這個人就根本剝奪了生活的重心。」[49]而他所倡導的由愛命運延伸而來的態度則是：忠實於這個未必完美的世界，真誠的面對生命，而不是以一些形而上的名詞自我欺騙。 尼采認為後世的耶穌的門徒及基督徒並沒有遵守耶穌的教誨，他原本的教義遭到歪曲。所以他說：「基督教的『教』字只是一個誤解，實際上只有一個基督徒，而他已在十字架上死去了。」 [39]而造成這種現象的最大原因就是保羅。保羅並未貫徹耶穌的愛與不抵抗的主張，他的內心充滿了怨恨，他假借上帝的意旨來進行報復。他引入了報償的概念，強調若耶穌沒有復活所信的便是枉然。他還改變了天國的意義，塑造出一個脫離於人間的天國，這恰好顯示出他對這個世界的怨恨。 尼采認為履行耶穌本人的所作所為才是真正的基督徒，「只有基督教的實踐，一個像那個死在十字架上的他所過的生活，才是基督徒。」 [40]，但後來的教會卻強調信仰高於實踐。 尼采曾在《反基督》一書中，粗略的道出他所認為理想的社會制度。他把社會階級分成三等：第一等是最有精神力量的菁英份子，創造價值，由他們擔任統治者的角色。第二等人是意志或性格堅強的人，他們聽命於第一階級，負責維護社會秩序及執法。等三等人是最多數的平庸大眾，滿足於他們平凡的生活。尼采也強調對於建立一個理想的社會而言這三種階級都是不可或缺的。他也不贊成以強凌弱，他認為高等人善待比他低等的人是應該的。「事實上，如果要有例外的人，平凡的人是首先就需要的必然：高等文化依存於其上。例外的人應該對待平凡者比他自己和同等級者更溫柔，這不是出自內心的禮貌—這根本是他的義務。」[57]，這種「例外的人」甚至可以用「具有基督心靈的羅馬凱撒」[58]來形容。 至於如何實行這種社會制度？尼采對於這個問題則沒有答覆。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Religion/%E9%98%BF%E5%A5%8E%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%94%E8%B7%AF%E8%AB%96%E8%AD%89/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Religion/%E9%98%BF%E5%A5%8E%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%94%E8%B7%AF%E8%AB%96%E8%AD%89/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟨 ref: 阿奎那：五路論證
從十一世紀開始，由於阿拉伯人統治西班牙及十字軍東征，大量經由阿拉伯哲學家詮釋過的亞里士多德(Aristotle)著作流入西歐，對很多西歐思想家影響至鉅。其中最為著名的思想家當屬托馬斯．阿奎那(Thomas Aquinas)。和伊斯蘭世界不少哲學家一樣，當時的天主教道明會(Dominican Order)亦熱衷發掘 亞里士多德 形而上學中的 神學成份。阿奎那作為道明會的修士，自然深受該會影響，走上研究亞里士多德形而上學之路。
形而上學 阿奎那繼承了亞里士多德的形而上學思想，認為形而上學是首要科學。因為形而上學所研究的對象——即存在——具有最大的普遍性，而各門科學都是只是研究單個個別的存在者，但形而上學所關心的是存在本身。阿奎那認為亞里士多德形而上學當中的存在概念指的是實體的存在。舉例來說，當我們斷言小明是膽小的，我們就是斷定了有小明這一個實體存在，而膽小則是小明這個實體的屬性。
實體是支持屬性的基礎，沒有了實體承載，屬性便會因為無所依附而消失。 屬性則是多變，但無論小明是英俊還是變得醜陋，還是同一個小明。不過衍生一個問題：若人要進行認知行為，那到底是認知了該物的實體還是屬性呢？阿奎那認為實體與屬性是互相依賴的，我們不能認識無實體支撐的屬性，也不能認識無屬性依附於其上的實體。
形式與質料 若要研究實體與屬性的概念，阿奎那首先必要回答到底實體是由甚麼東西構成，於是阿奎那引入了亞里士多德形而上學第二組概念，即形式與質料。以一棟房子為例，房子的長、闊、高是規定房子的形式，而磚頭與木料等是屋子的質料；實體即由形式與質料兩者構成。不過形式與質料之間的角色位置不是固定不變的，較高一級的東西相較於低自己一級的東西是形式；較低一級的東西相較於高自己一級的東西是質料。 例如比較房子和磚塊，房子是形式，磚塊是質料；而比較磚塊和紅土時，磚塊是形式，紅土才是質料。 （參見：亞里士多德（上）：傳承．邏輯．本體）除了角色位置可以隨高低層級而變化，阿奎那亦認為在形式與質料之間存在運動的變化，質料本身可以通過獲得形式而由潛能導向實現。 由此，便引入亞里士多德形而上學的另一組概念，即潛能與實現。
潛能與實現 質料如果沒有被形式所規定，它只是純粹的潛能。質料可以通過被形式所規定，慢慢實現自身的潛能，走向實現。 若以紅土作為質料，經過設計，紅土成為磚塊；而磚塊又進一步被利用來蓋房子，變成宏偉的建築物，如此一來，最初作為質料的紅土便不斷獲得規定，自身慢慢變得豐富和複雜起來。那麼質料能否完全實現自身，由純粹潛能走向純粹實現呢﹖阿奎那認為只有神才是純粹的形式和純粹的實現，在神自身之內沒有絲毫尚未實現的潛能。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Religion/%E9%BD%8A%E5%85%8B%E6%9E%9C%E8%AB%96%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Religion/%E9%BD%8A%E5%85%8B%E6%9E%9C%E8%AB%96%E4%BA%BA%E7%9A%84%E5%AD%98%E5%9C%A8/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟨 URL: https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%A2%E5%80%AB%C2%B7%E5%A5%A7%E8%B2%9D%C2%B7%E5%85%8B%E7%88%BE%E5%87%B1%E9%83%AD%E7%88%BE
Highlights 存在的層次 齊克果將人的存在描述成三種不同層次：「感性」、“理性”和“宗教性”（或稱“審美”，“倫理”，“宗教”） 。感性的人或是享樂主義者、或是熱衷於生活體驗的人，他們主觀而具創造力，對世界沒承擔、沒責任，覺得人世間充滿可能。理性的人則是現實的，對世界充滿承擔和責任，清楚明白人世間的道德、倫理規條。因此，有別於感性的人，理性的人知道這世界處處設限，充滿著不可能或疑問。面對不可能和疑問，理性的人就只有放棄或否認，並永遠為失去的東西而悲傷。這個時候，人只有靠著「信仰的飛躍」進入宗教性，用信念的力量戰勝疑問和理性上通常認為是不可能的事。只有信仰，才能使人重獲「凡事俱有可能」的希望。 在《恐懼與戰慄》中，齊克果思考 舊約中「信仰之父」亞伯拉罕聽從神的指示殺子獻作燔祭的故事。他認為如果亞伯拉罕不在乎自己的兒子生死、沒有道德倫理以至親情的心理掙扎，或者認為聽命於神而殺子是一種道德規條，他的所作所為就毫無意義。亞伯拉罕的行動的價值在於他從理性躍進宗教性，信仰神的大能、相信凡事可能、奇蹟會出現（結果神在最後關頭遣天使阻止亞伯拉罕殺死兒子）。齊克果認為，不通過理性的話，是不會有信仰的。 ( View Highlight) 絕望階段 祁克果於其著作《 致死的疾病》中，認為絕望是不接受自己不想要的自我或固執於現狀的自我、最終“失去自我”，認為這也就是基督教所講的原罪。絕望的人不一定知道自己絕望、也不一定感到痛苦。最低層次的絕望在無知的人，一心只知世俗物事;這類人沒有自我意識，不認識自我的永恆性，更不知道自己陷於絕望。另一些人意識到自己為渴望得到某些世俗物事而絕望，但仍沒有自我永恆性的意識。另一些人開始意識到自我、永恆性，也意識到自己為世俗物事而絕望的軟弱，為此他們也就不願接受這個自己，結果陷入另一種絕望。再進一步，一些人決定接受軟弱，聽天由命，承認自己的永恆性。進而，他們要願意接受當前的這個自己。他們可能選擇靠著「信仰的飛躍」重獲希望，脫離絕望;可是他們也可能選擇視絕望為最終真理，將自己置於永恆的絕望中。 於是，人在不同存在層次也就有不同的絕望。感性的人為世俗物事而絕望，理性的人也就為拒絕自我或選擇視絕望為最終真理而絕望。信仰是脫離絕望的唯一方式，選擇信仰也就是實現自我的唯一法門。 ( View Highlight) 他認為每個人對所處環境都有巨大的責任，雖然世界不斷在演進卻仍不能把人解放出來。而所謂「本真的存在」（authentic exist）是指有自由意志的個人，會向善或向惡作決定。而在決定的時候，因為人是有限的，所以焦慮和失望的產生是可預期的。 ( View Highlight) 這一類的焦慮有兩方面：一方面，是「無法實現」的焦慮，因為受到限制，而有不能實現自己的焦慮。另一方面，是想要實現自己和害怕實現自己的雙重焦慮。而這裡所談論的亞當不是指原來歷史上的亞當，而是指存在我們每個人中的亞當。 ( View Highlight) 齊克果的信心的跳躍是談到當人面臨抉擇的時候會引發焦慮，而這種決定是一種跳躍的動作，它無法用邏輯方法來推演。齊克果認為人的墮落也是一種非理性的跳躍。然而另有一種跳躍，就是信仰的飛躍，同樣不能從處境中推演出來。當人面臨致死的疾病或是無法克服的焦慮，信仰卻能幫助人克服。 ( View Highlight) 在齊克果的理論中，信心的跳躍有三個階段，但是這些階段不是時間上的那種階段，而是包含美學的、倫理的和宗教的，這三階段彼此間相互聯繫，無法清楚分開，例如在最後的宗教階段裡，仍不免存在倫理思想和美感。尤其是他認為倫理宗教是具有主觀性的，是源於他獨特的審美觀，而美感卻不能用邏輯來推理。而上帝是所有行為與思想的終極前提，因此更無法用推理與邏輯證明上帝的存在。 ( View Highlight) 美學階段的特徵是與人的生存扭在一起，他在這裡所談到的美學不是指美學這門課程本身或藝術，而是一種衡量的標準。標準是按照每個人和每件事是否能夠滿足自己的美學，也就是聖經中描述猶太人對於好的事情或正確的事情，就稱這事為善、為美的「美」，這就是屬於美學的階段。 ( View Highlight) 在倫理階段，齊克果提出「魔性的」（demonic）這一個概念，是「自我隔離」（self- seclusion） 的意思，也就是沒有走出自己。跟這種自我隔離的情況相反的是愛，愛可以引導人走出自我隔離的處境，也就克服了「魔性的」。這種愛的特徵可以引導到愛的關係。也就是說在倫理階段中，愛克服了孤立進而產生責任心，而透過責任心就可以達到倫理的階段。 ( View Highlight) 齊克果主張「主觀的真理」，為新正統神學奠定了哲學根基，重新尋找神話語的神學，將信仰置於崇高的地位，只把理性當作是理解神話語的工具而已。就是因為神話語中的基本真理具有弔詭性，使得邏輯學的 非矛盾律（A≠-A）在基督教神學也不管用，因為神的意念（思想）高過人的意念（思想），神的道路（方法）超過人的道路（方法）。 ( View Highlight) 齊克果對於真理的定義，特別是關乎神與人類存在的真理，是指「一個客觀不明物，人透過內心最深的熱情去攫取，並且將它緊抱不放。」但是，「當主觀、內在是真理，客觀定義的真理就成為弔詭。」道成肉身就是一個「絕對的弔詭」，所以只能憑著信仰披露與理解。 ( View Highlight)</description></item><item><title/><link>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Society/How-do-you-incubate-a-mind-virus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dans-huang.github.io/Add-Lightness//Society/How-do-you-incubate-a-mind-virus/</guid><description>tags: #🗃/🟥 aliases: ref: https://twitter.com/bfcarlson/status/1596146675021762562

there&amp;rsquo;s a particular dynamic associated with the kinds of media that are broadcast ( View Highlight) for example broadcast television in the day of three networks there was only three people who got to be the anchors who communicate it out to the entire population is a massive asymmetry but the speaker and the listener and there&amp;rsquo;s no interaction ( View Highlight) Note: between the speaker and the listener it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite interesting that for example school has a very similar shape to it in the sense that you&amp;rsquo;ve got one speaker a large audience and very little interactivity particularly like the university setting with is a lecture and there&amp;rsquo;s 500 people in the lecture hall that is effectively the same thing as television in the sense that the the relationship of information flow is effectively the same ( View Highlight) this is important both from the sort of social dynamics as well as from the psychological dynamics because if as a child your primary relationship to how you engage in culture is one of almost certainly being a pure receiver then your psychological development your set of assumptions and habituation and how you adapt to the world will be associated with that environment ( View Highlight) this implies a certain set of sort of deep psychological structures so we get is a relationship between the the mechanisms and techniques and potentialities of broadcasts as a as a concepts of school television film the blank and the the behavior strategies the habits and even the capacities of the individuals in the social layer so when you get to the to the mid late 90syou&amp;rsquo;re actually dealing with the society that could be understood as the Society of broadcast and that has implications for how decisions are made ( View Highlight) you have a set of hierarchical structures where the individuals who have permission authority and responsibility for speaking for having authority are selected in some fashion to be positioned at the top of the broadcast hierarchy and then the rest of us defer to them ( View Highlight) so somebody has written an article in Encyclopedia Britannica or some group of people some group of experts who have been nominated in some fashion to be positioned as experts and at best take that responsibility very seriously they pull the the total set of questions back into their centers of excellence in having conversations and academic environments and you know groups to get together instinct tanks they produce an authoritative statement of what is in fact our collective opinion around this particular object they then disseminate it through a broadcast medium and the rest of us listen to it cohere around it and say ok that&amp;rsquo;s what we do and then move forward ( View Highlight) this is actually a very powerful mechanism because it allows us to simultaneously have hundreds of millions of people broadly share the basic set of assumptions about the nature of the world the nature of what effective action looks like even values what is important what&amp;rsquo;s not important ( View Highlight) so a major piece not the only piece but a major piece of the transition that we&amp;rsquo;re going through is precisely the fact that a decentralized communication infrastructure sometimes known as the internet and all the manifestations and mobile everything else radically changes that dynamic ( View Highlight) the people who grew up in the post internet environment have a fundamentally different psychological set of structures like deep habitual architectures and expectations of how to most effectively present themselves in the world then people who grew up before them ( View Highlight) what that will mean is two things one is the set of techniques and approaches that socially evolved in the television and the broadcast era are suddenly maladaptive in this new psychological ecosystem ( View Highlight) but the psychology and the technology of the internet or of this the decentralized asymmetrical medium is one of no no we get to critique we get to directly respond to and things that feel like they are broadcasters feel like they are quite obviously intending to influence us emotionally we know what that feels like and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work anymore so we&amp;rsquo;re going to respond to that and our ability to respond swarms around it and breaks it up ( View Highlight) I think at least a reasonably good explanation for what&amp;rsquo;s been happening in the political domain over the past 30 or40 years and certainly over the past two ( View
