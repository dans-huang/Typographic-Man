- > look at the movies listen to almost every song almost every story told in the popular culture ends up with someone shaking off you know the oppressive influence of a tradition or someone telling me what to do and i find my own voice um so yeah i think that's almost the dominant uh motif in the culture especially among young people you know it's always been attractive autonomy sure that's my life it's my decisions and so on but it's a dead end when it's one-sidedly emphasized ([TimeÂ 0:05:04](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b714079e3aed0009177294?annotationId=62b7146fb4520a0009745cb9))
- > the trouble is the oscillation between the two and that happens a lot is i'm so strong on autonomy it's my life it's my will it's my way that leads to trouble and then i can sometimes react from that and go all the way to heteronomy i turn my life completely over to parents or culture or you know pop stars or whatever it is that's got its own negativity where we're trying to go is theonomy which is god becomes the nomos of my life god becomes the governor of my life and that actually affirms what's best in both autonomy and heteronomy ([TimeÂ 0:07:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b714079e3aed0009177294?annotationId=62b714b9b4520a0009745cba))
- > look how the book of exodus talk about throwing off oppressive heteronomy it's about a people who are enslaved by a deeply corrupt political and religious culture and they throw off their chains they escape from that heteronomy but what's interesting where do they go they don't simply wander on their own steam into the desert rather they go to the sacred mountain where they receive what a law so yes they've escaped from oppressive heteronomy but they haven't lurched toward sheer autonomy what they've gone to in fact is what i just called theonomy where god and god's law becomes the governing principle of their lives yes indeed that's everything great about autonomy is contained in that story but it's not a one-sided affirmation of autonomy it's a journey from heteronomy to theonomy i would say so that becomes the master metaphor if you want for the whole bible ([TimeÂ 0:10:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b714079e3aed0009177294?annotationId=62b71537b4520a0009745cbb))
- > getting rid of the divine king that ain't the answer oppressive human kings sure like pharaoh you know overcoming that kind of heteronomy sure but the answer is not a lurch to autonomy it's a surrender to theonomy god becomes the nomos god becomes the law and norm of my life ([TimeÂ 0:15:54](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b714079e3aed0009177294?annotationId=62b716224e34a80009fc6085))
- > in a way god's law is beyond me that's true it's heteros if you want it's other but it's not other in a conventional way it's other in such a way that it affirms me and brings out the very best in me right that's the bible but that's a tricky place to find that's a tricky spiritual space to move into ([TimeÂ 0:18:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b714079e3aed0009177294?annotationId=62b716774e34a80009fc6086))
