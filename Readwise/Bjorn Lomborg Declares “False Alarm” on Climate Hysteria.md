- > in almost every way we can measure almost every way we can measure life on earth is better now than at any time in history we need to take a collective deep breath and understand what climate change is and isn't it is not like a huge asteroid hurtling toward earth it is instead a long-term chronic condition that needs attention and focus but one that we can live with ([TimeÂ 0:01:01](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=635b749cccea7900092e4315))
- > it's the perfect opportunity for politicians and for media to tell you this is the end of the world however the problem is of course if we end up believing them we will throw everything at climate change problems and forget the many other problems that we should be focusing on ([TimeÂ 0:06:04](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=635b75a6e9f15e000975de3c))
- > there's a simple reason but it's one that's hard to grasp it's the idea that we'll actually adapt to much of this ([TimeÂ 0:07:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=635b7603e9f15e000975de3d))
- > the point here is to recognize that there is none of these problems that are unimaginable to handle it is one of those that are very very easy to pre you know sort of envision i think it's a good point that you make uh when you look at most movies they are very very good at telling you this story about the end of the world you know yes we're almost used to seeing these uh this dystopian uh dystopian futures but it's funny if you'd actually think about what it would have looked like for someone to watch a movie of our world a hundred years ago it would be unimaginably amazing ([TimeÂ 0:13:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=63723c12d9ef0f0008a922db))
- > remember we've gone from a world where in 1800 about 90 95 percent of all people were extremely poor what we define as extremely poor today that number is less than 10 by 2100 it will be zero it will be effectively zero but but that's not the only thing you also got to remember that uh david wallace wallace and many others like to uh like to make the arguments what happens if you keep planting the same stuff no matter what happens so you know i i used to grow wheat i'm going to grow wheat i'm going to plant it the same day even though it's gotten hotter and hotter over the last 80 years surprisingly my weight fails most farmers aren't that dumb they actually smart people they will start planning other sooner or they'll start planning different stuff they'll start moving you know so we actually have when you take that into account the models show a very different outcome much much lower reductions however you also need to remember co2 is a fertilizer we know that you know gardeners routinely put in lots of co2 into tomato drink greenhouses to make them more plump if you add on the co2 you again get much lower reduction sometimes even increases and then the final point is agriculture is a very very tiny fraction of human output it used to be and in many very very poor countries it's still the vast majority of your economic uh input if you're rich it's one two three percent in 2100 it'll be half a percent and so the reality is even if we have to put in more effort into growing food and of course by 2100 we'll be doing it in big factories with with lots of led lights and all that stuff yes it'll be more expensive even in this worst case scenario but it will mean instead of costing 0.5 percent it'll now cost 0.75 and actually i'm not just picking those numbers out of the air because the biggest study that's also the some summation of the biggest uh roundup study of what will be the impact of global warming on agriculture at worst it'll cost us 0.26 of global gdp because we'll have to put in more effort yes again it's a problem no it's not the end of the world ([TimeÂ 0:15:54](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=63723d05d9ef0f0008a922dc))
- > mitigation policies often make life worse especially for the poor ([TimeÂ 0:19:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=6377915bd242d4000859931e))
- > if you do mitigation so basically cutting carbon emissions it means essentially making energy more costly if it didn't if it actually meant you know some people will tell you oh we'll actually get rich doing it well then let's get going but then you don't really need any help you don't need any subsidies you don't need anything else we'll just do it because it's cheaper the reason why it's hard is because it's more expensive look that does not necessarily mean we shouldn't do it because everything you like cost money better school cost more money better health care cost more money it's fine to spend money but we just need to recognize that we're actually spending money we're spending resources that we could have spent on other things so getting people less effective more expensive less reliable energy for instance has real cost just give you one example we know that one of the things that especially hurt the poor is the fact that they spend a very large amount of their money on energy so if you make energy more expensive it simply means that they'll be able to for instance warm their houses in the winter less well that has real consequences because that actually makes more people die from coal remember coal kills many many more people than heat surprisingly to some but this is you know very very well established and we have a study that showed what happened for instance with fracking back in around 2010 it was sort of a natural experiment the price of gas dropped dramatically one of the impacts was that people who heat their homes with gas could suddenly afford to heat their homes better especially the poorest of americans what happened was that saved according to one estimate eleven thousand people from dying every year if you ramp up the cost of gas because you are concerned about climate change that means some of those lives are again now gonna start being lost there are real consequences to making energy more costly we might want to spend that but we should be honest about saying it has real costs ([TimeÂ 0:19:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=63779136d242d4000859931d))
- > it is perverse to hear rich people piously claim that we should help the world's poor by cutting carbon dioxide to make their future slightly less worse when we have huge opportunities to make their lives much better much more quickly and much more effectively ([TimeÂ 0:21:35](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=6377917ab642e3000889168c))
- > there are some things that are very very simple and we have i think a moral responsibility to do first and unfortunately as we're getting increasingly worried just about climate we're forgetting almost all these other concerns where we could help much better much more efficiently and actually help today's people who are really poor instead of up people 100 years who are going to be much better off ([TimeÂ 0:22:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=637791c40b438b000815bf29))
- > if you look at most ways we fix problems it is through technology but unfortunately most ways that environmentalists want us to fix problems is through sack and cloth i think is the word you know you do with less ([TimeÂ 0:23:51](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=637792d542a4a2000882742b))
- > fundamentally a simple technological change can make a huge difference and it's much much easier to convince everyone to do so on climate change most climate campaigners are basically saying look i know the world got so much better because you have all this access to you know electricity and you can go all places and you can have fossil fertilizer that actually can feed you and all that stuff that's all nice and good but i'm sorry could you you know turn down the light stop driving stop doing all that fun stuff and be less content and of course that's easy to say to really really rich people but to all the world's poor it's essentially telling i'm sorry you just gotta stay in poverty those are very very hard arguments to make and i think fundamentally immoral ([TimeÂ 0:25:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=6377931a42a4a2000882742c))
- > the problem with the existing uh sort of venture capital argument is that most of these will only invest if they can see a payoff in the next five years but it's much more likely we're talking about an investment future of say 40 years ([TimeÂ 0:29:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=637793ae5712f50008dfc9df))
- > in some sense there's very little incentive to invest in these long-term really visionary ideas that's what we need to do however the world is not doing that because we're so focused on spending on green energy that you can see on tv so you know the wind turbine parks and the solar parks that look good like we're doing something let's just remind ourselves right now the world gets just over one percent of its energy from solar and wind despite all the spending that we've done and even by 2040 it'll probably just be less than five percent that comes from solar and wind so we're still talking about a very small bit we need this innovation and we need to spend a lot more to actually get these long-term benefits ([TimeÂ 0:30:12](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=637793cdf1b93e00085e5e3f))
- > growth and especially for the world's poor is absolutely essential prosperity is one of the ways that you fix climate change this does not mean we should have that we should not have a conversation about saying look we are willing to waste a little or forego a little bit of our growth to have a better environment and one way that you should do that is to recognize global warming is a real problem by spending some resources on actually fixing climate change we will end up better off overall ([TimeÂ 0:44:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=63779580f1b93e00085e5e40))
- > a vast international machinery of governments and u.n agencies now exists to promote the strategy of climate mitigation the word you used earlier mitigation which they have successfully transformed into the world's largest secular religion ([TimeÂ 0:52:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1510d8deb0009f2bd01?annotationId=63779629f1b93e00085e5e41))
