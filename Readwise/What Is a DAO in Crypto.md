- dows can continually improve and growjust like peoplebecause their shareholders can submitand then even vote on changes to them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpazrhr4emwjr10hf9x6ywp))
- in the world of crypto a dow maylaunch with a few million tokensevery token is a vote and whoever holdsthe most tokens can have the largestvotesthis gives the tokens a price and italso gives them ause it also allows the dao to improvemake changesand evolve as the world evolves now thisincludes actually hiring voting on a
  salary and then technically evenemploying certain developerswithin the autonomous organization itwould then just pay themwith cryptocurrency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb0rqnd724ffpxx33qpqyc))
- benefit number one isthat it's trustlessand this is probably the biggest benefitof a dao ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb33wazcdabgkr9sxjwkdj))
- in fact you do not need totrust any ceo or manageror leader with your decision makingskills the programor the whole organization will continueno matter if a major developer stopsworking on the projector even if the funding goes away ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb3rjdb9s8ey5cf5rnp5y7))
- anotherbenefit is that they cannot be shut down ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb417dm2czc9m031nz8gme))
- the last benefit of a dow is that it isopen sourcedaos are also open source which means
  that their code is out there for anyoneto look atand even improve upon open sourceprojects are usuallymuch more reliable simply because otherprogrammers canhelp the main developers find some bugsin their code and then even propose waysto fix them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb50fazknxqsvcn3xbd8pb))
- the first downside is that they arevulnerable to attackssince anyone can look at the code italso means attackers can look at it ifthese attackers knowintimately how the code works they canthen reverse engineer the attacks
  and even test the code before deployingit to make sure that their code worksif it does the dow could be attacked ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb5gc51m49nzavv2p8asa7))
- thesecond downside that we have found isthat there's no business secrets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb6avhabdzhbemvtepayd6))
- in a dow though business secrets aredifficult to keep secret since the code
  is all open sourceand really anyone can look at how thedao is set up ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb6x1zyjbqf2fefnmaabg1))
