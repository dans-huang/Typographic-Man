- the way I see it uhis that we have to separate theengineering problem from the humanproblem and just the way if you tookover an internal combustion enginemanufacturer you shouldn't set yourselfthe the goal of building a trulyefficient engine because you'll never dothat uh you have to figure out at somelevel where do we stop takingresponsibility for The Human Condition
  uh and pretending it can be fixed as anengineering solution ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn4xn4nyafey0k4200g4k8j0))
