- Anne-Marie Willis wrote an amazing article,in which she basically stated it like this.Everything that we design, in turn, designs us back.So we are being actively designedby that which we have designed.
  Our thoughts shape our spaces and shape our tools.Our tools and spaces return the favor,as Steven Johnson tells us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyn4fzqtqk8s4mdtgxdzsbf))
- it shows that there a sort of spacein which what is without, ultimately is within.That there's a circularity.That our actions matter.That the choices we make today for our dwellings,for our museums, for our institutional systems,everywhere we place the body-mind has to be designed,knowing that everything that we are designingis designing us back.This is ontological design.
