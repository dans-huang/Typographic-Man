- > we self-organize as families small businesses corporations nation states to optimize surplus but it's not really surplus it's 09:00financial representations of surplus and that's tethered to energy tethered to carbon and that this system is out of control as a super organism um a super organism it's not really a physical entity it's just the behavioral dynamic of eight billion of us roughly um just pursuing these cultural objectives uh and it's no longer in anyone's control there's no politician or billionaire 09:30that is actually steering it so that that's kind of the dynamic that i've come up with is that we have outsourced the planning of our system to the financial market and that momentum worldwide of making decisions to keep that optimized suppresses any other paths of wisdom or constraint that might be totally viable and makes sense ([TimeÂ 0:08:49](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71b88bde7e400095752ac))
- > the financial system has an embedded growth obligation it has to keep growing or this particular system breaks and it has to keep growing at a percentage of the previous year so you have a compounding interest thing which means you have an exponential curve so there is an exponential embedded growth obligation on finance but finance is bound to the real world and you can't exponentially grow the extraction in the real world specifically you can't keep mining stuff on renewably and turning into pollution and trash and you can't keep having the 11:00energy that it takes to move all those atoms or the bits around um indefinitely ([TimeÂ 0:10:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71bc9bde7e400095752ad))
- > computation still takes energy and so even when we're talking about 12:00uh capital associated with digital goods and services it's still energy dependent it obviously takes energy moving atoms around to make the computational substrate you got to do a lot of mining and you got to do a lot of fabrication to make the computer chips and the servers and the satellites and whatever and then the computational systems require energy so the movement to digital doesn't get us off the need for energy ([TimeÂ 0:11:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71be9508ef70009ebc6fe))
- > this is why the jeffers paradox is so fundamental is ultimately the dollars are seeking returns anywhere and they'll seek the highest returns possible but they'll seek any returns too there will be a power law distribution on return so i can get 1000x return of course i'll get it but if i can get a three percent return i'll you know a large amount of capital we'll do that so when you get increases in efficiency you just get a cheaper industrial input you know a cheaper market input which means that a lot of things that weren't profitable now become profitable so the surface area of profitability expands 13:30and this jevon's paradox just like everybody who's focused on environmental issues needs to kind of take this very seriously which is you increase efficiency of say here energy production now you have cheaper energy energy is one of the key inputs to every industry cheaper input means a whole bunch of non-profitable areas become profitable and the market expands ([TimeÂ 0:13:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71c50508ef70009ebc6ff))
- > because of that we still get this coupling between dollars and energy dollars are on an exponential growth curve up that means energy has to be on an exponential growth curve up you can't do exponential extraction of energy forever and we're already on a diminishing return on hydrocarbons meaning uh hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons out the energy return on energy investments and diminishing return and yet it has to keep up with a very verticalizing uh part of the exponential curve on um 14:30finances there's a problem there right like and you can only quantitative ease and subsidize that thing for so long there's like a fundamental problem there and so of course the answer is just renewables well great we'll meet all of that energy with renewables except right now the energy return on energy of investment of the renewables means you got to use way more oil to get the non-oil producings off and the curves still just don't work in the current way we're looking at it so there's just some very deep reckoning and the relationship between the embedded growth obligation and finance and the physical limits of the real 15:00world atomically and energetically and the relationship between those there's a heap of complexity from there but that simple summary kind of gives you the exponential growth of the metabolism of the super organism ([TimeÂ 0:14:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71c9cbde7e400095752ae))

- > what ends up happening now as a world not as individuals we're doubling our debt every eight to nine years as a as a world and we're only doubling our gdp was which is the income stream required to pay back that debt every 25 years or so and that's before energy declines ([TimeÂ 0:18:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71d35bde7e400095752af))
- > there is no recognition that all the financial claims in the world be they stocks or bonds or pensions or retirement fund when they are cashed in they have to be cashed in on something that will require energy and materials to qua to convert 19:00and and that is just a fundamental disconnect in macroeconomics ([TimeÂ 0:18:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71d4dbde7e400095752b0))
- > all governments and institutions at least ostensibly in the world expect 19:30two and a half to three percent growth into the future that is like the standard expectation out 50 years so given the tether of energy and gdp which is around 0.99 to 1 globally and given the tether of materials to gdp which is pretty much one for one you refer to that as atoms so the link between atoms and gdp growth is pretty much one for one we've we've grown our material footprint 2.8 a year since the 20:00year 1900 so given that if we grow at 3 percent a year in order to maintain and service the financial claims that we're adding all the time we will double the amount of energy and materials used on the world in the next 25 to 30 years and we'll double it again after that that is a serious problem um 20:30that more people need to think about because i don't think the next doubling is going to happen and so how do we respond as a culture to that ([TimeÂ 0:19:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71d92bde7e400095752b1))
- > the digital economy the services economy still require materials economy and the growth of them still requires growth 21:30there and even if you get some increases in efficiencies which is awesome you get those increases in efficiencies those increases in efficiency also grow the total material economy in a pure market system because the market system is going to take returns wherever it can get them ([TimeÂ 0:21:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71de9bde7e400095752b2))
- > the social structure is kind of the social agreement field the law governance in particular and the institutions that mediate how do we do our social agreements the infrastructure is the tech stack that that rides on the modes of production agriculture energy waste management all that kind of stuff and the superstructure is the what is the definition of the good life what are our ethics what is the basis of the jurisprudence of law and so that could be religion nationalism all those types of things ([TimeÂ 0:31:01](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b720654e34a80009fc6087))
- > a lot of people have this weird kind of conception that technology is just values neutral i can use a hammer to build a house for the homeless or i can use it as a weapon but there's no value embedded value system embedded in the hammer it's just the value system the person that chooses to use it and that would be the same with everything in our industrial supply chain and they either have that view or some people have the view that tech is fundamentally values positive that's 33:00kind of the generals um hobbesian pinker and you know gatesand kind of view of the dialectic of progress that tech only gets selected for and the market only upregulates it if it's solving some real problem that people want and they're willing to pay for so of course it is inherently liberating humans from problems that allows them to expand and so it's fundamentally net positive um then there are the lewis mumfords and everyone who have critiqued why that's not true 33:30and many people then can go in a luddite direction of like no tech actually messes up religions and societies and ecosystems and so tech is fundamentally net negative to our value systems i would say we're arguing in this paper all three of those are naive tech is values affective it affects it in a complex set of positive and negative ways and very much in the same way that tech will produce some positive thing in the physical world but also externalize some negative things it doesn't have one effect it has a complex set of effects and we need to factor the positive and 34:00negative externalities in addition to the thing it was supposed to do and factor that into design that's also true in the psychological space ([TimeÂ 0:32:35](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b720ec4e34a80009fc6088))
- > tech that is highly advantageous to use is obligate you don't get to not use it 38:30and make it through history and so somebody else will use the plow they'll grow their population because of the massive caloric increase they'll make it to the famines if we don't then our tribe will get killed by them and or die in the famine so even if i don't want to i have to and if i don't i don't make it through history so very adaptive tech is obligate that's principle one ([TimeÂ 0:38:26](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b72217d299250009b042ea))
- > principle two is that it codes a pattern of human behavior now rather than being a hunter gatherer i'm 39:00beating a box all day right and i'm branding and binding its nose and whatever else i have to do because it codes a pattern of human behavior it codes a pattern of values in human psyche and be than to do that in scale means it codes a culture and so animism was universal in south america north america africa europe whatever it was pretty universal and animism died following the ox driven plow almost everywhere because you can't be animistic and be an 39:30animal all day long and so kind of some version of man men's dominion over type ideologies emerged following it ([TimeÂ 0:38:53](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b7223aec0b7100092c126c))
- > that piece of tech changed the value systems from all life is sentient we're not the web of life we're merely a stranded at whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves two man's dominion over it's all here for us you know that kind of thing that was the result of a value system embedded in the technology itself inexorably embedded not based on how 40:00people used it but embedded in it and then some historians go on to argue that not only did the plow do that regarding animism it also went from where previous to the plow societies and david graber's new book adds a lot of nuance i'm at i'm doing like a hundred thousand foot view but that whether women were gathering and men were hunting or women were doing horticulture and men were hunting women could still provide half the food stuffs men had to do the plow because women would miscarry men's upper body strength 40:30mattered so now men provided the meat stuff and the vegetative stuff women moved in the house as a result you also move from a distribution of male and female gods to mostly male gods so the thing that is called patriarchy oft is often attributed as a rising is a byproduct of the plow also and the movement from all the food that gives life being male derived rather than female because again of the physicality uh involved in the nature of the plow then of course that gives you surplus and before that you didn't have surplus so you have these you didn't have private property ownership you have 41:00these different kinds of sharing systems now with much more surplus you could grow the population a lot faster now you've got larger than dunbar number kind of empires now you've got um radical wealth inequality and class systems so we're like are there arguments about why that ended up requiring more formal institutionalization of marriage on larger scale because now i own stuff that i could pass on to my kids when i died so i wanted more paternity certainty so everything from like institutionalization of marriage to 41:30views towards animals to to patriarchy versus matriarchy to the formalization of economic to class systems all as possible second third order outputs not in the physical world but in the cultural world of a piece of tech ([TimeÂ 0:39:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b72287d299250009b042eb))
- > we can go through similarly the way the printing press ended up giving rise to the protestant revolution and democracy and because without the printing press you can't have everybody have a newspaper and have books so only a nobility has access and we can go on and on and look at how each 42:00piece of tech if you use it in code's game theoretic power where those who use it will get ahead and those who don't will end up not making it through history so it's obligate it codes behavior as a result it codes values and minds as a result of doing that in scale it codes cultures so it's not just that we have to have values from something like religion or whatever to make us use tech well it's the tech is directly creating our values also so we have to design tech that in mind not just how does this tech 42:30externalize costs in the physical world meaning um you know the mining byproduct and toxic tailings that come out of this mining technology and whatever but how it externalizes things into the human psychological cultural world we're calling this kind of axiological design how do you embed the axiology the ethics into the tech design ([TimeÂ 0:41:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b722b6d299250009b042ec))
- > i see 44:30agriculture as being the second major spike in our ability to extract energy from the environment i see fire being the first major spike in agriculture then oil and then digital technologies that increase our ability to do all of that faster and of course there's a million sub refinements so it is surplus and its energy like they're both fair ([TimeÂ 0:44:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b7231ad299250009b042ed))
