- blockchain is a system of storing datathat makes it difficult or impossible tochange hack or manipulate the data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9xpf1m2erq54wx5sd2ftp))
- it's basically a digital log oftransactions that are duplicated andspread across the blockchain's wholenetwork of computers and the dow issomething that makes use of its rulesand policies for its proper functioning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9yw09z7qa0tv78h2sk0r2))
- a dow or decentralizedeconomist organization is a blockchain
  based organization that is collectivelyowned and controlled by its membersthey have built in resources that no onecan access without the group'spermission ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9z6k5pe3ycr98tmbqvem1))
- all proposals are implemented usingvoting processes to make decisions uponits rules and policies ensuring thateveryone in the organization gets a say ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9zd590qyx1q4q60vw7q1s))
- this whole system majorly runs onethereum blockchain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9zgpp3hjhf2rdszwyqp4v))
- smart contracts are the
  backbone of doubt ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa2w7z15aa00v1a9a4n3jd))
    - Note: doa
- smart contracts are programs that runwhen certain conditions are met and arestored on a blockchain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa3783jybfjc19drkfxaxa))
- step one is when the documentation ofthe idea takes place in the similar wayin doubt ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa5s77bffrgrx05cgj9056))
- a group of people write thesesmart contracts to administer theorganizationonce the contract goes live on theethereum networkchanges to its rules can be proposedonly by voting the contractautomatically fails if the rules are
  violated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa63epb1eq3yjvqghf2kct))
- step two which is a fundingperiod in which pitching of ideas takesplace in front of the selected membersand investors of the organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpak2a2h4xbha5xchdqaces))
- similarly people in the dow organizationcontribute money to the dow bypurchasing tokens that signify theirmembership in the organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpakfn8hyzaw851fh55n823))
- when the funding period ends itproceeds to step threethat is when the approval andimplementation process of the idea takesplace or say the dow starts to operate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpamdsmbtg51hs08ngd0aqk))
