- > from primeval times we gather around campfires but if we lose the capacity to talk to each other in a civil way we lose the campfire something essential is lost ([TimeÂ 0:08:08](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b3276045dfab0009e176d0))
- > we find definition of consciousness in the exchange of ideas right you know that which rises to consciousness is that which can be packaged for for the exchange and uh that reveals i think how social we are ([TimeÂ 0:08:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32796bed4e300082d8001))
- > there's an ebb and flow between a an interactive collective consciousness and a necessarily private version and i would 10:00argue that it's something we have undeclared dark ages in which the exchange of ideas are not welcome and so really i actually have a term for it i call the people who think independently when thinking collectively isn't allowed keepers of the flame and um you know so i think some compassion for their position has to be has to be extended because what happens when it is again possible for us to talk together is that those who remember how to do it because they brought it into uh a less obvious space 10:30those people jump start the process and unfortunately we are now at this moment facing a bizarre kind of dark age where in some ways we have never had better tools for interacting with each other and it has never been less welcome that we do so and so uh yeah looking for the mechanism now to re-jump start that conversation which has to start with this question that you raise which is do we not agree on the conversation as 11:00paramount ([TimeÂ 0:09:49](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b327cebed4e300082d8002))
- > because it is easier uh to to discuss with the public and even with 13:00other scientists that which is easily uh measured that which is easily quantified that that which is easily reduced we end up focusing on those questions and then the mistake is we think that those are the big questions those are the real questions and we sort of replaced the language of the small with the language of the large and we pretend that we've asked the big questions ([TimeÂ 0:12:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b3280345dfab0009e176d2))
- > the first step out of the cave for plato is mathematics which always strikes me as fascinating because a scientist would deal with the world of the empirically verifiable and what i can experiment upon for plato that would be and there's no insult to scientists it would be standing staying inside the cave right what what are mathematical objects and 18:00numbers and do they represent like these sheer intelligibilities that go beyond what the sciences can immediately measure is that a step to a higher dimension of being ([TimeÂ 0:17:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b3289245dfab0009e176d3))
- > plato may have envisioned the the route there as starting with math 19:00and that may be a route there but it's not the only route there and if you if you talk to scientists who do work in this extreme emergent realm i don't think it would be intuitive that you start that you you start by saying well what what patterns can i detect and what do they imply what might they imply and then you check and they either do or don't imply that and you know so it's a start anywhere all roads lead to rome ([TimeÂ 0:18:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b328d2bed4e300082d8004))
- > if you start with an openness and you know and really i think as we 20:00already talked about you know just an understanding that there is an objective reality out there that you are trying that you are seeking to understand knowing that you have all of your own biases that you can never escape and you can use methods um that you and others before you have discovered by which to produce those biases you know all of these things are wondrous ways to approach it but um but you can't fully escape them and there is an objective reality and beyond that let's let's go ([TimeÂ 0:19:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b328f6bed4e300082d8005))
- > the ultra massive black hole is the the right place to start the question of what is a galaxy but it's not where you start because we're all outside of all of those galaxies we see the stars grouped for reasons we think they're attracted to each other and we don't realize that there's an even more a bigger more shocking answer but you wouldn't go back and say well the 24:00whole way we studied this is wrong because you really have to start with the ultra massive black hole that brought those stars together you can start anywhere and that's just that's you know i mean that's sort of the human predicament we are in one place at one moment studying an impossibly large cosmos full of the strangest phenomena and we have limited tools to unpack them but you know what they're good enough ([TimeÂ 0:23:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b3296cbed4e300082d8006))
- > the value of science comes from a balance between this this instinct to reduce and the 29:30competing instinct which is to synthesize ([TimeÂ 0:29:22](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32a0445dfab0009e176d4))
- > how do you explain the unreasonable applicability of mathematics to the physical sciences um well it's interesting i often find um physicists and mathematicians are uh 32:00they become strange around this very question okay and i mean really there are sort of two general routes you could take you could say well the universe is very odd and improbable place and we could ascribe that odd improbableness to some force that was up to something or you could go the other direction and you could say that the math is somehow downstream of the biology right that obviously math is an inherent but the math that we do is obviously the product 32:30of human activity and so maybe there's something in the way we conceptualize it that of course builds a tool that's capable of unpacking this very odd and maybe arbitrary universe that we have ([TimeÂ 0:31:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32a5ba851dc00096d9758))
- > as 41:30the descendants of a three and a half billion year old lineage of things that preferred living to dying right it's not surprising that we at this table would be agreed that taking your next breath is the obvious move right we are deluded by that selection by having been favored by an unbroken line of three and a half billion years of survivors right survivors and reproducers that those are good things to do but the point is that's not inherent to the universe that's inherent to where how we got here 42:00and so why do creatures want to get their genes into the future they want to get their genes into the future because in the word creature is the implication that they are the descendants of creatures that have done a spectacular job of getting their genes into the present ([TimeÂ 0:41:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32b3a45dfab0009e176d5))
- > we have an obligation having recognized that we are effectively in some ways very sophisticated robots that have been sent on a mission that mission has elements that we as conscious beings esteem and it has elements that we as conscious beings must abhor and the point is this 45:00is the moment evolution has awarded us a a mind that is capable of deciding what fraction of these things we actually want right and we actually uh on that discovery become morally obligated to reject the genetic program ([TimeÂ 0:44:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32b85b995060008e9d30d))
- > the problem is that the moral sense did evolve and as heather points out i wrote a paper on why and the problem is that the why has a troubling it implies a troubling question the why is that 53:00if we accept that morality is effectively synonymous or nearly synonymous with the willingness to sacrifice an opportunity right to bypass something in the interest of something else and the point is well why why in evolutionary terms shouldn't you want everything right that you want you wouldn't want them if you didn't so the reason is because you have different levels of success in tension with each other and so 53:30a society has moral rules and we treat each other uh we self-sacrifice for each other why because we get into the future better by doing so but here's the bitter pill the bitter pill is we get into the future better by self-sacrificing for each other's benefit in order to compete with other populations and they do the same thing and the problem is that ultimately this leaves moral goodness downstream of our attempt to defeat other creatures which have every 54:00right to get their genes into the future too yeah and so the basic point is okay we have a moral architecture why because it's a mechanism for getting genes into the future but we can now take that moral architecture and we can say can we do something better with it right having done something better with it we end up somewhere in the direction of buddhism right where we say well how do we include everybody in the we ([TimeÂ 0:52:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32c6cbed4e300082d8007))
- > just because you figured out one of the functions of the thing 58:00doesn't mean that you've figured out all the functions of the thing and of course chesterton's religion chesterton's gods in windvault as well you know too many moderns overthrow all that has worked in the past in favor of the new yeah and often there is no new worth standing in ([TimeÂ 0:57:57](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32ccdbed4e300082d8008))
- > we've protected children far too much and because they live in a world that has been purged of risk for them at the point that they face risk they don't have the tools to manage it and so they demand safety they demand someone deliver them an adult analog of the world they grew up in and it's impossible it's not good for them and yet we're tearing apart civilization over the demand ([TimeÂ 0:59:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32ce7bed4e300082d8009))
- > you know that something magical doesn't happen on your 18th birthday right and you're suddenly an adult right it is a series of it is developmental it is evolutionary and it requires the experience otherwise we have as we have too many of now um adults by in body um but not in mind ([TimeÂ 1:00:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32d1d392d430009cc87e1))
- > the problem is we we descended from people whose cultural traditions were a perfect match for their environment or nearly so and the lessons the proper lessons would automatically be acquired and it was a dangerous world but it was a world in which you could bootstrap your way to high levels of adult competence just by doing what seemed like you should do by being cautious when you felt fear you know that sort of thing right and we have removed the logic and we haven't actually then noticed what that obligates us to do ([TimeÂ 1:01:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32d47a851dc00096d975b))
- > the only way you're going to mature into an adult who can manage these things is if you have close calls and you process them properly ([TimeÂ 1:03:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32d8a392d430009cc87e2))
- > the societal level tragedy of raising whole generations of children who have not been exposed to risk who don't have the capacity to navigate any of these things is far greater and it doesn't leave the same kind of obvious death count it doesn't leave the obvious bodies but it is a bigger tragedy it's a bigger average and so i mean again maybe this is a problem of reductionism you can easily point to a tragically dead child and it's harder to point to generations of people who don't know how to navigate their own moods or bodies or decisions ([TimeÂ 1:04:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32dc2a851dc00096d975c))
- > what puts pornography in a separate category is the market influence over its content and if you think for a second about what it is that people who produce pornography are doing in the market they're competing with each other for attention and in order to get attention when in fact what they're selling is just access to erotic content they have to push the boundaries of what's acceptable in order to stand out in that saturated market ([TimeÂ 1:06:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32df2392d430009cc87e3))
- > i believe that people who come into their sexual understanding by watching porn it's all about me it's my it's all about me and no matter what the person watching does cannot change the the thing that is happening and so of course they are going to be when they come to find what might be their life partner um that they have no idea actually what to do to actually come into relationship ([TimeÂ 1:08:21](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32e2eab074a0009d9c3fe))
- > the first thing to recognize is that evolution is in some ways practical to an absurd degree and what it has done is it has built us to be focused on exactly that range of phenomena that we can have some productive influence over but it isn't scheduled to being a modern person that that realm is set based on what an ancestor had power over ([TimeÂ 1:11:53](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32eacab074a0009d9c3ff))
- > our sense of what is important is built in a world we no longer live in and what that means if you correct for that distortion that evolution has made us focus on the here and now because that was what was productive in the past if you correct it and you say well what am i really yeah right i am a very temporary custodian of something really important and ancient and it is my job to do what i can to make sure that thing is still happening a thousand years from now and 5 000 years from now well it changes everything yeah it changes everything about what you are and it also changes your um it eliminates your solipsism right once you realize that you're a temporary custodian of something that if all goes well will be here long after anyone remembers who you were right well then the point is that's a that's a lot of responsibility b it puts in context what we call the cosmic joke right you are in a very odd position as a creature with sort of limited deductive skills in a very complex confusing universe trying to make your way you know simultaneously not starving to death you know trying to figure out how to put your kids uh into a good position to thrive right it's a very odd thing to find yourself a person yeah um but it it's you can do better with it and you can do worse with it and that's kind of the question are you going to take what you've got and make the most of it without getting obsessed with the fact that you're not going to be here after a point ([TimeÂ 1:12:56](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b326f545dfab0009e16e02?annotationId=62b32ee7a851dc00096d975e))
