- > there's a good rule of thumb which is that we shouldn't solve family problems at the international level ([TimeÂ 0:03:43](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=6377989a8d2a0d0008b8607f))
- > you definitely need all the knowledge from biologists especially when you're talking about things that impact the natural world you need to talk to epidemiologists when you're talking about diseases you need to talk to doctors also about diseases you need to talk to educational experts when you talk about education but the crucial bit that's connecting all of them is to talk about what are the resource needs that is basically how much money are we going to have to pay in order to get a solution 14:30when you talk about global warming or a solution for education or a solution for tuberculosis or covet or any other thing so what we're talking to is all those economists who do that so climate economist or education economist or health economist these are all guys who interface with all of the specific knowledge but they also study how much is this going to cost and how effective is this solution going 15:00to be so it's basically about saying what can you do about global warming or what can you do about covet remember no solution is going to fix all of the problem most solutions will fix part of the problem and so what we're saying is what will a realistically best sort of effort look like how much will it solve and how much will it cost and then we try to estimate what's the relative value that you provided to the world and as you started off saying that's a difficult task 15:30but it is crucial if we want to know that we're not just focused on the topics that have uh the most cute animals or the people who scream the loudest in the media but actually know what works ([TimeÂ 0:14:01](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779a138d2a0d0008b86081))
- > it isn't good enough to point out the hypothetical flaws of this approach it's only good enough to put forward a viable alternative ([TimeÂ 0:17:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779a638d2a0d0008b86082))
- > global warming is real it's man-made it is a problem i'm simply accepting what the u.n climate panel the ipc is telling us about global warming what i'm arguing is how much will a potential solution cost and how much good will that solution deliver to humanity so the real question here is are we spending lots of resources doing not very much good for climate 21:00when we could be spending those resources much better on climate that is doing much more to actually tackle the climate problem and of course also that we could spend those resources and do much much more for the whole world with its many many other problems those are two important questions i think and the reason why they matter so much is because in many ways uh you know if you're just going to talk very very rough numbers the world spends about 150 billion dollars on all the big problems in the world 21:30uh you know from uh peacekeeping forces uh to dealing with malaria and tuberculosis to uh hiv to education to uh gender equality to many many other problems but we spend in the order of 400 billion or more per year on climate change so if you look at the money that we spend on doing good in the world the vast amount of that money goes to climate change so if we get it wrong on climate we're 22:00really getting it wrong on how we tackle the world's big problems ([TimeÂ 0:20:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779ad339789d00087deb9a))
- > there's potential lurking catastrophes in everything we do you can't and that was nordhouse's point you can't just take one and say i'm gonna spend infinity over here because you should be spending infinity 35:00on pretty much everything else of course that doesn't actually compute and so what real people do all the time is we're faced with things that have a tiny probability of going really really badly we spend more resources on them we try to find more ways to tackle them smartly but we also recognize there's no way we're going to get rid of all apocalyptic problems we simply have to be smart about it ([TimeÂ 0:34:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779c150abcf50008c83d66))
- > saying that you're afraid of global warming has zero cost spending money on it has a cost obviously so the the thing is as soon as you put a cost to it then you find out that people don't 38:30appear to believe it ([TimeÂ 0:38:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779c750abcf50008c83d67))
- > it's moral virtue to advertise that i'm the sort of person who's intelligent enough to conceptualize global concerns and empathic and noble enough to be concerned by them and then you say well what are you doing about it and the answer is well i'm not doing anything and then you 39:00say well then i don't buy your claim but that's pretty rude and two people who get together who are both concerned about global warming aren't going to be criticizing each other's lack of diligent attention to the sacrifices they can just embrace one another ([TimeÂ 0:38:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779ca40abcf50008c83d68))
- > there are real costs to getting this wrong the costs are the money spent and what that money could have been spent on instead ([TimeÂ 0:39:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779cc60abcf50008c83d69))
- > this is the world bank's uh dynamic uh uh trade models that show that once you get a society that's able to trade internationally and 46:30openly you also get enhanced growth within those countries so that means they by themselves get to be better so that and these would mostly be poor countries that would also be a lot of rich countries but these would mostly actually help the world's poor because they have the most catching up to do and they will then be much better off not only would that be better for them because if you're poor a thousand dollars is a lot better than if you're rich getting another thousand dollars but also because it will help them 47:00generate all the other things they would like to have education health uh resilience to global warming so the whole point here is to recognize that this is one of the things that are hard to have a discussion about there are very few people are advocating global uh free trade there are lots of people advocating against it but we need to recognize this is one of the things that have helped pull out most people of poverty that we know could do even more in the future and that we have a real opportunity to 47:30achieve ([TimeÂ 0:46:21](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=63779ddf1a7a36000800b6be))
- > the reality of course is if we go down the route of these very alluring but incorrect arguments this is the end of the world you know let's spend everything on climate change what really could happen is two things we end up spending lots of our resources on things that are not very productive and won't leave us very well off that will cut maybe half or a fuller maybe one and a half percent of gdp growth from our growth rate that could be potentially dramatically damaging in 10 20 30 years once we're a lot less richer a lot less better off because remember one of the things that keeps societies peaceful is that we all have a future to look forward to that's going to be much better once we start realizing we're entering into a stable state where if you are better off it's because i'm less well-off we will get much much more antagonism so i think it's realistic to say if we follow down those alluring roads we might actually end up leaving our future of our grandkids much less better off not just in the economic sense but also just simply in a wildly sort of rioting kind of way that everybody will be at each other's throat that's one part of it but the other part is to remember we're right now talking about how the west or the rich part of the world thinks about this problem most people in the rich world actually think the the future is going to be a lot worse off which is one of the reasons why global warming fits into that whole pattern i think it's wrong that's also what the model said that it's even what the human climate panel says but that's how people feel the other three quarters of the world which are china india latin america africa they actually believe that their world is going to be much better in 10 20 30 years they have this future belief that you were just talking about from from out of the second world war they are not going to say yeah we're going to do strong climate uh policy and become poor they want to mostly become middle-income countries and maybe even rich countries eventually they will want to do this so what will happen is both that we're leaving ourselves in the rich world to become much more infighting and much less well-off than we otherwise would be and that we're actually seeing the other three quarters of the world just simply running uh you know possibly even ahead of us but certainly uh running ahead without looking at the same kind of problems that we are ([TimeÂ 1:12:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=6377a2e639789d00087deb9b))
- > the reality is the over worry about global warming that we have because we're you know we have this existential feel that this could be the end of the world surprisingly also not only is wrong but it also leads us down the wrong path namely the path where we say let's do anything that just makes it look like we're doing something next year rather than actually laying the groundwork for fixing this problem ([TimeÂ 1:38:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=6377a50f7cab52000854c7d1))
- > most of the things that you're impacted with you're impacted with because you're poor if you're really poor everything hits you hard but climate hits you hard as well if you're rich you're much much less impacted ([TimeÂ 1:49:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd152a8c562000af8f96f?annotationId=6377a5f5545b7100089168bf))
