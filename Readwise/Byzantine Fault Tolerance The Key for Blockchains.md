- The ability to tolerate what computer scientists call "byzantine failures" is a crucial part of blockchains' ability to maintain reliable records of transactions in a transparent, tamper-proof way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq55b1bdxcnzetwsd7bs76w9))
- BFT is so-named because it represents a solution to the "Byzantine generals' problem," a logical dilemma that researchers Leslie Lamport, Robert Shostak and Marshall Pease described in an [academic paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Flamport%2Fpubs%2Fbyz.pdf) published in 1982. Essentially, it imagines a group of Byzantine generals and their armies surrounding a castle and preparing to attack. To be successful, these armies must all attack at the same time. But they know that there is a traitor in their midst. The problem they face is one of launching a successful attack with one, unknown bad actor in their system.

- In any distributed computing environment, meaning an environment where multiple users, applications, servers or other types of nodes compose the environment (like a blockchain), there is a risk that rogue or unreliable actors could cause the environment to break apart.

- In order to be reliable, a distributed computing environment has to be designed in a way that solves the Byzantine generals' problem by providing what's known as BFT. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq56x71qh0435824tey4tm5h))
- Perhaps nowhere is BFT more essential than on a blockchain. Most traditional distributed computing environments have central configuration databases or authorities that can help right wrongs in the event that Byzantine failures occur. But on a blockchain there is, by definition, no central authority. Blockchains' ability to legitimate transactions based on community consensus alone is what makes them so powerful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5706mf0rtgf1q00dr24ra2))
- This heavy reliance on community consensus also makes Byzantine faults a particularly important challenge for blockchain. If some members of the community send inconsistent information to others about transactions, the reliability of the blockchain breaks down, and there is no authority that can step in to correct it. So, unless you can place absolute trust in everyone who participates in your blockchain (which you can't in most situations), you need a way to protect against the Byzantine faults that could occur in the event that some members distribute inaccurate, misleading or malicious transaction information.

- Many of the most influential blockchain systems to emerge so far, including Bitcoin, have relied on a concept called [proof of work](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-proof-of-work-concept/) (PoW). Under this model, anyone who wants to add to the blockchain must perform a work-intensive task using information from the existing blockchain in order to add new information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57a6zshvdxnm3g6bebs8mz))
- On a blockchain that is sufficiently large, the PoW requirement effectively provides BFT. This approach also has a limitation, however. It requires the expenditure of a large amount of computational effort for no purpose other than fault tolerance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57bt6z92jszqsp8vr0j0x8))
- An alternative solution - and one that does not require compute-intensive operations - centers on relying on node votes and majority consensus in order to root out faults. The downside to this strategy is that it provides protection against byzantine faults only so long as a relatively large majority of nodes on the blockchain continue to act legitimately. Consensus regarding legitimate transactions could become unclear in the event that the number of rogue nodes began approaching fifty percent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57mhp51yfgjk8t6a28sv8c))
- since blockchain technology in many places is still in the design and planning phases, understanding BFT matters for people who want to apply blockchains as novel solutions in areas beyond digital currency. Bitcoin's approach to the byzantine fault issue may not be practical for other types of blockchain applications. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq57jy2etygen4186mrmn339))
- BFT is a crucial part of an effective blockchain and there are multiple ways in which it can be implemented. Deciding which approach to take requires weighing the nature and priorities of the community associated with the blockchain an organization wants to build.
