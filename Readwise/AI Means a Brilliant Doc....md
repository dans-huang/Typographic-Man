- AI means a brilliant doctor on your phone. Who can diagnose you instantly, for free, privately, using only your locally stored medical records.
  Do you think the doctors will be happy about that? Or the lawyers? The artists? The others that AI disrupts?
  Theyâ€™ll fight it. Hard. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1623861319031218176))
- AI directly threatens the income streams of doctors, lawyers, journalists, artists, professors, teachers.
  That happens to be the Democrat base!
  So theyâ€™ll lash out. Hard. AI safety for them means job security. Everything is on the table, from lawsuits to laws. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1623864711048761344))
- The last decade showed us that the US establishment hates tech.
  Think about how they lost it over a better way to call a taxi!
  Weâ€™ll soon see whether a down-the-middle, by-the-rules approach works â€” or whether every company that tries it gets sued & regulated for their trouble. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1623867921352237056))
- Will a teacherâ€™s pension fund consciously back companies that replace every human teacher with a far superior AI tutor?
  How about a college endowment, when AI does that to professors?
  Will the AMA accelerate AI diagnosis?
  Will journalists cheer their AI replacements?
  No. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1623869864199995393))
- Overnight, weâ€™ll see many blue checks start acting like blue collars.
  The US establishment will turn even more protectionist, once politicians realize that AI doesnâ€™t vote but their constituents do.
  It wonâ€™t stop every use case. But itâ€™ll fight many of the important ones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1623871229487878144))
- AI likely increases global equality. But itâ€™s the elephant graph to the Nth power.
  Billions of people get free AI tutors, doctors, accountants, and lawyers.
  And the top end also wins, the power users & platform operators.
  But the median rich country citizen? Maybe not so much. https://t.co/o4kqa9iruC

- While the US establishment will pointlessly fight it, and the Chinese establishment will totally control it, if weâ€™re lucky we may see the rest of the world build free and decentralized AIs.
  As training costs come down, we should build the tech to enable thatâ€¦ https://t.co/16JLMZhNmv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1623877822287691777))
