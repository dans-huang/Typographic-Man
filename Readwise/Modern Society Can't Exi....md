- Modern society can't exist without 4 ingredients:
  1. Ammonia (fertilizer)
  2. Plastics (computers, health care products)
  3. Steel (skyscrapers, bridges, cars, scalpels)
  4. Cement (buildings, roads, dams, runways)
  They all require fossil fuels.

- Ammonia, plastic, steel, & cement represent 17% of global energy & 25% of all CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.
  Currently, there are no commercially available & readily deployable mass scale alternatives to displace these processes.
