- >11 Billion COVID jabs have been stuck into the arms of people worldwide.
  The pandemic response has affected every one of us.
  But 99% of people don't know about the single event that influenced virtually every shot. 
  I'll tell you what happened & who paid the bills.

- THE DOHERTY INSTITUTE
  Melbourne, Australia
  MISSION
  "Improve health globally through discovery research & the prevention, treatment & cure of infectious diseases"
  FUNDED BY
  - Australian taxpayers
  - And the WHO
  - And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
  - Oh, and also Pfizer

- WAIT A MOMENT!
  Before I go any further I want to make something 100% clear.
  700+ people work at the Doherty Institute. 
  I'm sure the overwhelming majority are hard-working, well-meaning, principled human beings.
  This is not an attack on any of them.
  Furthermore... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528025653325826))
- I'm not a scientist. 
  Or the most qualified person to interrogate complex scientific data. 
  But I'm more than qualified to ask a few questions.
  I like questions about incentives because the answers point to the truth. 
  I have a formula for hunting reality via incentives üëá ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528027649777665))
- 2 QUESTIONS
  - Who benefits?
  - Who pays the bills?
  1 RULE
  - The more motivation the messenger has to mislead you, the more skeptical you need to be of their message.
  That formula will allow you to cut right through 99% of the irrelevant noise & reveal the truth.
  Ok, let's go... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528029612654593))
- Everyone knows a respiratory illness started circulating in Wuhan, China in 2019.
  We all watched as this new virus exploded across the globe. 
  We didn't have a vaccine yet but fear not...
  Big-pharma heroes like Pfizer were there waiting to save us all from certain demise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528032313839616))
- The major barrier was that nobody outside of China had been able to cultivate the virus in a lab.
  So we didn't have a sample to test potential vaccines against. 
  Until a little something happened at the Doherty Institute on 28 January 2020...

- Great news!
  The Doherty Institute immediately started sharing samples of the virus.
  Labs working with the World Health Organization all over the globe got busy.
  The starting gun cracked & the big-pharma vaccine race was on.
  And it gets better...

- To a pharmaceutical company, this is like Christmas.
  "We'll capture people who didn't even know they had it? This will pump the case numbers to the moon!"
  "What if the WHO declared a global pandemic?"
  "What if governments even coerced their citizens to take our drugs as well?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528072033947650))
- Let's apply our simple method:
  Who benefits from a global pandemic? 
  Big-pharma does. 
  They exist to make drugs and sell them at a profit. 
  The more the better from their point of view.
  And a pandemic is a bonanza of potential profits.
  Next question: Who pays their bills??? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528073988481028))
- Well, their customers do. 
  In the case of Covid-19 vaccinations, governments take care of the invoices.
  They pay them using taxpayers' money, and lots of it.
  Does big pharma have a big incentive to mislead you? Yep.
  Would they? Yeah, history suggests they would... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528076161040385))
- Pfizer is the heavyweight champion when it comes to this game. 
  Below is an eye-opening highlight from a comprehensive article written by Simon Elmer.

- Multiple BILLIONS of dollars.
  Crooked. Corrupt. Convicted.
  If your level of trust in this mob is higher than absolute zero at this point, I doubt anything I can say will save you.
  Next, let's apply our method to the Doherty Institute.
  This is where it gets a little murky... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528097912762368))
- The doors first opened at the Doherty Institute in 2014.
  They need to keep the power on, buy microscopes & hire people to look down into them.
  So, who pays the bills?
  If you search, you can find a list of grants that funded their first 5 years of operation. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528100085452801))
- One of them jumped off the screen for me...
  A single grant worth a lazy $3.9 Million. 
  This tidy sum landed in late 2019 - right along with the emergence of the COVID-19 chaos.
  Guess who dropped that stack of cash?
  Who else... 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRoAQ7nX0AEvA-4.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528120020975622))
- To be fair, that's only one of the grants the institute received.
  And the stated purpose is cancer therapy, not COVID-19.
  But it's the largest grant from any non-government source.
  It's the 5th largest grant on the list.
  And the timing is remarkable.
  Also... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528122482995200))
- The Australian Government commissioned the Doherty Institute to model data for them.
  Policymakers then relied on the Doherty-modelled data to inform & justify their response. 
  Including some of the most authoritarian & coercive COVID-19 mandates anywhere on the planet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528124420759552))
- The mandates drove Australia to one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.
  At 83% "fully vaccinated", Australia's vaccination rate is much higher than the US, the EU, or the UK.
  This begs the question: Who supplies the majority of COVID-19 shots to Australia?
  Pfizer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528126345887750))
- So...
  - Pfizer gave several million $$$ to the Doherty Institute
  - The Doherty Institute produced the data used to justify the jab mandates
  - The mandates drove the vaccination uptake
  - Pfizer made a fortune by supplying the lion's share of the jabs ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528128371798016))
- You don't have to call this a conspiracy to recognize the problem here.
  Without question, these are horribly misaligned incentives.
  A conflict of interest by any reasonable standard.
  It invites problems. It breeds them. 
  It undermines integrity.
  And it's only one example... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528130426945536))
- We would be here all day if I also went into...
  - The links to the WHO & all of their incentives
  - The million bucks in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
  - The fact that Peter Doherty (the man himself) is on the steering committee at the Human Vaccines Project 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRoASP0XIAccgKj.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528141063802881))
- A lot of people were coerced into taking shots they didn't want.
  People are ridiculed for asking questions.
  They are told to trust the science.
  I've got another suggestion...
  ‚Üí Trust the incentives.
  And be wary of the messenger with a motivation to mislead you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/CriticalSway/status/1520528143475429379))
- We need a critical mass of people asking more questions.
  My mission is to encourage everyone to do exactly that.
  If you want to spread this around, give the 1st post a re-tweet.
  And stay tuned - there's plenty more where this one came from.
