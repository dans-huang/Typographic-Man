- > a society grows great when old men plant trees who shade they know they shall never sit in a greek proverb from a time well before the problems of our modern economies or the study of economics itself is as true today as it was thousands of years ago ([TimeÂ 0:00:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b4783b096ba600099fd533))
- > lord david willets a british politician demographer and author suggests that the opposite may be true and that in a democratic system being part of a larger cohort is actually preferable because it gives that group more voting power on generational issues and more sway in marketplaces ([TimeÂ 0:02:04](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b478c05066cf0009250c69))
- > it is easy to see this trend throughout the past half century in most advanced economies in my own home of australia for example the 2019 federal election was more or less decided by a policy decision that would reduce the tax effectiveness of australian retirement accounts the party that advocated for keeping the favorable tax structure ended up winning primarily thanks to older australian voters ([TimeÂ 0:03:36](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b47912096ba600099fdfa4))
- > a 2017 british election study found that over time votes for conservative parties have shifted from being divided by rich and working class to being divided by young and old ([TimeÂ 0:04:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b4791f396d7e000938bf70))
- > higher interest rates actually kind of helped them saving money for a deposit in an account that pays 10 interest per year really accelerates that savings goal higher interest rates also ensure that house prices never got too high because the repayments would just become unaffordable ([TimeÂ 0:08:04](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b479e25066cf0009250c6b))
- > if the repayments were kept equal the person buying the home in 1985 could have it paid off in five years rather than 30 years ([TimeÂ 0:08:57](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b47a34396d7e000938bf71))
- > every economy in the world is still for better or worse focused around large centres of economic activity what a regular person might call a city if the real estate in these cities becomes too expensive then it becomes infeasible for workers to hold down jobs there because more and more of their income will just go to paying rent in the short term this can be offset by higher wages but then these centres are really just operating for the benefit of the landlords that are lucky enough to own property there the money that landlords make from their properties are unlikely to be reinvested into company growth or spent on regular consumer consumption that keeps these businesses in business it is likely to be spent on more property further driving up market values and the amount of money that gets sucked out of productive centres to be shoved into unproductive assets ([TimeÂ 0:10:04](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b47a995066cf0009250c6c))
- > the concentration of wealth in a particular generation is something that can have very real consequences for entire economies and these effects are only going to get more pronounced as populations continue to age ([TimeÂ 0:11:26](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b47ac55066cf0009250c6d))
- > most people don't receive money from their parents passing until they are pretty old themselves often approaching the end of their careers or starting retirement if the money gets handed down to them they are likely just going to use it to fund their own retirements and then just hand down whatever's left to their own elderly children money pooling in the hands of older people means less opportunity will be afforded to younger people to do all the things that they do to build a functioning economy ([TimeÂ 0:12:54](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b47b14bac9ae000913c9dc))
- > economic prosperity was also something that boomers enjoyed that wasn't necessarily within their control the last half of the 20th century by historical standards was very peaceful the world also opened up to international trade and growth was put into overdrive by an abundance of cheap energy in the form of fossil fuels it was a great time to make a fortune and people did which is probably the final piece of the puzzle ([TimeÂ 0:14:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b477d1096ba600099fd532?annotationId=62b47b80bac9ae000913c9dd))
