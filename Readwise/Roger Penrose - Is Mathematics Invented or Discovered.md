- the mathematicaldescription of reality is where we're
  always led and these equations are it'sfantastically accurate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxb51ma7z84krbseq14dhfp))
- ourpicture of physical reality depends on
  something in the sense which is moreprecise at least in our understanding ofit than then then how we think about theworld and this precision really datesback to the ancient Greeks the time ofPythagoras and later where theydeveloped the mathematical ideas as afield of study stimulated to some degreeby physical reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0myyjcrpkwn45s26prtk9q))
- the mathematical reality issomething different it's it's sometimesreferred to as a platonic worldbrittonic reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n4eht7d06nap7712jknph))
    - Note: platonic reality
- therebeing different ways of looking atreality there's the reality of ourmental experience which okayinterrelates with the reality physicalreality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n24c5djyfvq3b5cwqvcjb))
- and so then there's themathematical reality of this platonicworld which gives reality to these
  notions so if you like mathematicalfacts like there is no largest primenumber is if it's something independentof ourselves it's always been true ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n2x38bs7gdzr5t3t0s02r))
- in a sense that had to be so because if
  the physical world depended so preciselyon these mathematical laws I couldn'thave known what to do in a certain senseif the mathematics hadn't already beenthere I mean it's not us that imposesthis on the world that's it's out there ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n5q1yhsrax4vypgec3v8j))
- people think that you know maybe reasonwe have good mathematical laws ofphysics is that's the best way we cancome to understand the world but it'ssomething more than that it really isout there in the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n684gpgvxkw697vnrc0j9))
- Einsteinproduced his theory mostly out of hishead with that appealing to know thingsthat were known to Galileo and so on butapart from that it was not much moreempirical evidence but he produced histheory which extended far beyondanything that the observations at thattime told us about and they keep on
  agreeing with the observation so thattheory which is if you like a a platonicabsolute thing and it's a mathematicalthing seems to be inbuilt into the waythe world operates ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n8hyzvtk7cqckekqnb0zz))
- these really goodphysical theories are not like thatyou're revealing something in the waythe world operates which is there all
  the time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n923fxm5g228kwv08gjs3))
- I think
  there two aspects to mathematics pleasehow I look at it some people are justexploring the mathematics and that'stheir real interest and it's the beautyand the subject oftenand that's why they're doing it becausethey find it exhilarating something theyfind really wonderful to do but there'sthe other side of it which is how itrelates to the physical world and thereis this extraordinary precision that wefind when you get the mathematics rightit really mirrors the behavior of thephysical world to an unbelievable degreeand so there's these two sides to
  mathematics it has this reality whichyou can study quite independently of itsrole in physics and the other side whichis how it really does seem to reveal howthe real world operates in a certainsense what the world is as far as we canunderstand it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0ndngyrqsehb9gnjdpzwf3))
