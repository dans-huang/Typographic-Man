- A network state is a highly aligned online community with a capacity for
  collective action that crowdfunds territory around the world and eventually
  gains diplomatic recognition from pre-existing states. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbty23greg7pb0vqeeyynt7))
- A network state is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of na-
  tional consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action,
  an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual gov-
  ernment limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded
  physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves
  a large enough population, income, and real-estate footprint to attain a
  measure of diplomatic recognition. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbv0xcq0gyv7fdr2mtgmv4b))
- the community of network states as a whole is
  focused on building admirable societies that people want to join ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbv8nbxte1h8azx70vx666b))
- Diﬀerent states will
  focus on diﬀerent metrics; imagine a network state premised on improving its citizens’
  overall life expectancy, or one aimed at provably right-shifting the income distribution
  for all. You get what you measure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbvdghapjyzksb1d8vx43st))
    - Note: 網際網路所允許的互聯國家，會將傳統地域型國家的物理和歷史同質性（濱海所以捕魚、有廣大土地和合適氣候所以務農、人民共同具有特定戒嚴或殖民記憶所以擁有共同民族性等），轉移到以哲學/意識形態/治理措施為核心的心理同質性。
      於是這形成新創互聯國家之間的競爭（類似新創公司之間如何以理念、產品/服務、治理方式吸引人才），亦即更「純粹化」一個國家在其「共享價值和治理方式」上的重要性，作為吸引或排斥不同人們的關鍵因素。物理及歷史因素變得不再重要，就像新創公司之間的競爭可以完全無關工作地點、或對特定產業/母公司/家族企業的忠誠。
- A key concept is to
  go cloud ﬁrst, land last — but not land never — by starting with an online community
  and then materializing it into the physical world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsdkjyqmfwz6pz28pye86ht3))
- 1. Found a startup society. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsdkms22ehh38r3h78pqcqhb))

- The key idea is to populate the land from the cloud, and do so all over the earth.
  Unlike an ideologically disaligned and geographically centralized legacy state, which
  packs millions of disputants in one place, a network state is ideologically aligned but
  geographically decentralized. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsdm7m7gsmjdj45nx7n3wnvg))
    - Note: 地域性國家能夠擁有像是務農、觀光等清楚的產業方針，但網際國家呢？這些去中心化（但有向心力）的個人能夠如何為國家創造經濟價值？他們只有可能像是分散各地的網路公司員工（在還沒有集資擁有夠多的土地之前）？而且如果不是只要集會場所，而是企圖從既有國家手中獲得有經濟利益的不動產，他們應該如何從既有國家手中得到它呢（假裝還是該國的合法投資者？）？
- We want to be able to peacefully start a new state for the same reason we want a bare
  plot of earth, a blank sheet of paper, an empty text buﬀer, a fresh startup, or a clean
  slate. Because we want to build something new without historical constraint. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsw95krjjwfrgc2yhvbd756x))
- And that’s where we are today with countries, cities, nations, governments, institutions,
  and much of the physical world. Because the brand new is unthinkable, we ﬁght over
  the old. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyadpttrq3ca4rrm9axrkw4))
- We create a startup society, organize it into a network union,
  crowdfund the physical nodes of a network archipelago, and — in the fullness of time
  — eventually negotiate for diplomatic recognition to become a true network state. We
  build the embryonic state as an open-source project, we organize our internal economy
  around remote work, we cultivate in-person levels of civility, we simulate architecture
  in VR, and we create art and literature that reﬂects our values. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsybvmpwt5nffdtx753nrhev))
- What we’ve described thus far is much like an ethnic diaspora, in which emigrants are
  internationally dispersed but connected by communication channels with each other
  and the motherland. The twist is that our version is a reverse diaspora: a community
  that forms ﬁrst on the internet, builds a culture online, and only then comes together
  in-person to build dwellings and structures. In a sense, you can think of each physical
  outpost of this digital community as a cloud embassy, similar to the grassroots Bitcoin
  embassies that have arisen around the world to help people better understand Bitcoin.
  New recruits can visit either the virtual or physical parts of a network state, beta test
  it, and decide to leave or stay. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsybxabhfw1b15nykqa2enze))
