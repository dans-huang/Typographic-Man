- > in some ways marriage is the union of two people but in a possibly more fundamental way it's the union of two people to provide the foundation for children right and i would say that's actually paramount i mean our society tends to flip that around and we tend to think of marriage as something that while you find the partner right for you 11:30and you live happily ever after it's well no not exactly yeah and but or maybe maybe exactly if you also understand that living happily ever after means living for other people in many ways particularly your children ([TimeÂ 0:11:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d564ec6bf43000092aa42d))
- > each person has their own idiosyncrasies and some of those lead them down the garden path to terrible places but if you're with someone else and you have to negotiate with them constantly then that opens up the 14:00possibility of you mutually modifying each other's personalities so that you both become healthier and that your joint existence is a kind of can be a paragon of sorts and then that's what the child interacts with is that united front of the two parents right and so you get that longevity of view which i think helps to mature you but you also get the opportunity to become more fully fledged as a psychological being ([TimeÂ 0:13:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d5656a198ccb000977985a))
- > it's very very difficult to mature until you have children and there are other ways of maturing but it's hard and the reason it's hard i think is because you're not mature until someone else is more important than you ([TimeÂ 0:14:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d5657f198ccb000977985b))
- > we have this notion that's rife in our culture let's say that's insisted upon that all families are equally are equal and i understand the emphasis on that from the let's call it the tolerance perspective 33:00but i think that it's badly flawed in one manner and i think this will be the hardest thing probably for us to discuss is that you can't flatten out distinctions without a tremendous loss and i don't think it's possible to dispense with the ideal of heterosexual monogamy now as the ideal yes that's so if we think well there's an ideal individual who's responsible and mature and far-seeing and honest an honest trader a good player uh an honorable person honorable 33:30decent person and then there's the minimal requirement for a family that's ideal and that's something approximating heterosexual long-term heterosexual monogamy and maybe you have two decent people united together and then there's a firm platform for children now the problem with that as an ideal is that we all fall short of the ideal and so right half 40 of people are going to get divorced and of the people who don't get divorced a good percentage of them are 34:00in pretty damn miserable marriages now that doesn't condemn marriage but it does show how difficult attaining that ideal is and then there's going to be people who lose their partners and raise children alone and they're going to be people who raise children alone by happenstance or or choice and they it doesn't seem reasonable to what would you say um put them outside the bounds of civilized society let's say that 34:30by the same token it doesn't seem reasonable to dispense with the ideal yeah so maybe we need something like well we know what the ideal is it's a divine ideal in some sense in that none of us can live up to it but then there has to be a space around that ideal where the individual differences and flaws and peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of people aren't treated so harshly that that becomes counterproductive in and of itself it's damning with faint praise ([TimeÂ 0:32:43](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56877fb5c230009e09872))
- > about 85 of kids who manifest extreme gender dysphoria so the sense of discomfort in their own body and a desire to be 52:30the opposite sex 80 to 85 percent of them would desist on their own by the age of 18 or 19. and so his hypothesis was leave them the hell alone because you do the least harm that way and most of them will settle into their bodies as they mature knowing that puberty in particular especially for kids you could imagine a male who has a more feminine temperament and who's also perhaps higher in openness so has a more mutable identity more creative 53:00is going to be and and is going to be especially if higher neuroticism as well is going to be uncomfortable around puberty everyone's uncomfortable around puberty we should we should make that straight and so you just leave those you leave the kids alone but what he also showed and this is the killer fact as far as i'm concerned is that a very large proportion of kids with gender dysphoria grow up and are homosexual yes and so what that means what that certainly 53:30means is that the vast majority it might be as high as 80 of the kids who are being convinced now that they inhabit the wrong bodies and are being surgically mutilated on a in a permanent and terrible manner the overwhelming majority of them are gay ([TimeÂ 0:52:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56b1cfb5c230009e09873))
- > between tolerance and carelessness is a very difficult one to establish and if you are careless especially in your conceptualization and perhaps in your actions the best mask for that carelessness is to proclaim yourself to be tolerant oh everything goes it's like well that's because you have zero discipline and you're you're and you're and no no ordered conceptualization of the world whatsoever because of your lack of discipline now you're going to pass on all off as a moral virtue and well we're definitely seeing the consequences of that especially in the trans issue ([TimeÂ 1:04:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56ce1fb5c230009e09874))
- > everyone's got their idiosyncrasies and thank god for that and we definitely need creative people and we even need some creative weirdos you know because god only knows when they'll come in handy but the rule of thumb should still be to the degree that you're able to uphold the norms and ideals of the collective society you have a moral obligation to do that ([TimeÂ 1:06:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56d3fda39510009ce735b))
- > there are reproductive benefits to some of the factors that tilt towards homosexuality that are so powerful that they counterbalance the negative consequence of being able to unable to reproduce and it might be it might be that a fair bit of that manifests itself on the creativity side ([TimeÂ 1:08:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56d8cfb5c230009e0987a))
