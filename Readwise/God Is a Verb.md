- The shapes and contours of Christian faith in the emerging century will have a reality more influenced by "p2p" networks than by the printing press, and post-denominational structures will arise "with, in and under" our traditional denominational and non-denominational framework, to borrow a phrase from Luther's sacramental imagery.

- Looking back, we are able to see that it is always forerunners and outsiders that do the groundwork for the shifts that happen a few decades latter. For example, the current GreenTech revolution can only exist today because of the theoretical and philosophical groundwork laid in the '60s. The emerging church movement owes much to the groundwork laid by the liberation theologies of past decades. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtt5wjpzj0q3z84encm5jr4))
- Like John Caputo, I affirm that God as we have known him must pass away so that God as we could know her may emerge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtt8b215nvt9ezrd6tbr6k8))
- Caputo says -- and I want to affirm -- that the line between "atheist'" and "theist" (or "panenthesist" as well) is a false one. What he means is that God is not an all powerful/all-knowing being outside of history but is instead life itself. "God," Caputo says in *[On Religion](http://www.amazon.com/Religion-Thinking-Action-John-Caputo/dp/041523333X)*, "is a name we put on Love." Other names we put on love include justice, mercy, joy and goodness.
  God, then, is not a force who acts on the world through coercion, violence or the suspension of physics and free will. Instead, God is something that we participate in. God is a verb, an action we bring to the world to make love, justice, mercy, joy and goodness known. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtt9dk7tz8vgdazf8p9h742))
- The God who is a verb or a name for love does not extend beyond the personal God so many have held onto. Love is personal. Justice is personal. When we are loved we should scream, "Praise God!" The personal God is a valuable model as it moves the work of Love into the world of relatable and relational experiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttdwytetqcqf55gkq483x6))
- Remember we said that God is an activity; something that we make happen in the world, and as such is not contained to our religions but is present whenever a person enacts love, justice, mercy, joy and goodness?
  If God is a verb, then so is worship. The future of the church will not turn on our new theologies but on how we pray and whether our prayer is rooted in an action and activity. Can we honestly say "body broken for you" over the bread if we don't address how the world and church contributes to the breaking of bodies?

- The church -- which may not be a church as we know it but a study group, a 12-step style program, a distributed network spread across a city or even the world -- of the future will be a place where we celebrate the work of justice we have done and are sent back out to make God known. The church will be the place where we invite atheists, Muslims, Jews and the whole of humanity in and announce that, when we work from Love to make the world a better place, we all engage in the same thing. There is no line between the atheist and theist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtth510qsx5aphr3ngpvzk9))
- But then again the early Christian community called themselves The Way. A way indicates a path we walk, narratives we ponder and question we ask. It is telling that they did not call themselves The Answer. Following a way is an action. It is a verb. It is making God known because God is not far away and all-powerful but is instead something we make real in the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttk7xp6qks6hpdh19a9pdr))
