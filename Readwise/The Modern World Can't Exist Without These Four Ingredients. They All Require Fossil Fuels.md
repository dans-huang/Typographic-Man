- Modern societies would be impossible without mass-scale production of many man-made materials. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpba7v4e1ja9vbfj71hdfef))
- Four materials rank highest on the scale of necessity, forming what I have called the four pillars of modern civilization: cement, steel, plastics, and ammonia are needed in larger quantities than are other essential inputs. The world now produces annually about 4.5 billion tons of cement, 1.8 billion tons of steel, nearly 400 million tons of plastics, and 180 million tons of ammonia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbn1k860h9bsfk9msbfwd9))
- But it is ammonia that deserves the top position as our most important material: its synthesis is the basis of all nitrogen fertilizers, and without their applications it would be impossible to feed, at current levels, nearly half of today‚Äôs nearly 8 billion people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbncxyf8bmbfd07sgz5kdh))
- The dependence is even higher in the world‚Äôs most populous country: feeding three out of five Chinese depends on the synthesis of this compound. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbzxhp1rca3197vjej5bz7))
- This dependence easily justifies calling ammonia synthesis the most momentous technical advance in history: other inventions provide our comforts, convenience or wealth or prolong our lives‚Äîbut without the synthesis of ammonia, we could not ensure the very survival of billions of people alive today and yet to be born.

- Plastics are a large group of synthetic organic materials whose common quality is that they can be molded into desired shapes‚Äîand they are now everywhere. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbw75vzhd6k53wrt3h85jp))
- plastics are now most indispensable in health care in general and in hospitals in particular. Life now begins (in maternity wards) and ends (in intensive care units) surrounded by plastic items made above all from different kinds of PVC: flexible tubes (for feeding patients, delivering oxygen, and monitoring blood pressure), catheters, intravenous containers, blood bags, sterile packaging, trays and basins, bedpans and bed rails, thermal blankets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbs9xh68pj3k20mrbnjfzc))
- Steel‚Äôs strength, durability, and versatility determines the look of modern civilization and enables its most fundamental functions. This is the most widely used metal and it forms countless visible and invisible critical components of modern civilization, from skyscrapers to scalpels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbw16a9hk3zftzg6ryep1m))
- Moreover, nearly all other metallic and non-metallic products we use have been extracted, processed, shaped, finished, and distributed with tools and machines made of steel, and no mode of today‚Äôs mass transportation could function without steel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbxrx4d4bjy2tjft5fyy34))
- Cement is, of course, the key component of concrete: combined with sand, gravel and water it makes the most massively deployed material. Modern cities are embodiments of concrete, as are bridges, tunnels, roads, dams, runways and ports. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpbzk4bgnzsg8se7a28ve18))
- China now produces more than half of the world‚Äôs cement and in recent years it makes in just two years as much of it as did the United States during the entire 20th century. Yet another astounding statistic is that the world now consumes in one year more cement than it did during the entire first half of the 20th century.

- And these four materials, so unlike in their properties and qualities, share three common traits: they are not readily replaceable by other materials (certainly not in the near future or on a global scale); we will need much more of them in the future; and their mass-scale production depends heavily on the combustion of fossil fuels, making them major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpc11hgtddszfy9eyfty40d))
- the unfolding transition to renewable energies will demand huge amounts of steel, concrete and plastics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpcynpfxejf2rqe52mwe9e2))
- No structures are more obvious symbols of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù electricity generation than large wind turbines‚Äîbut their foundations are reinforced concrete, their towers, nacelles, and rotors are steel, and their massive blades are energy-intensive‚Äîand difficult to recycle‚Äîplastic resins, and all of these giant parts must be brought to the installation sites by outsized trucks (or ships) and erected by large steel cranes, and turbine gearboxes must be repeatedly lubricated with oil. These turbines would generate truly green electricity only if all of these materials were made without any fossil fuels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpczr84hjvmbcnhbpqxnev5))
- As a result, global production of these four indispensable materials claims about 17 percent of the world‚Äôs annual total energy supply, and it generates about 25 percent of all CO2 emissions originating in the combustion of fossil fuels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpdq7v07ge4dw2zffpnb65w))
- replacing fossil fuels in their production will be far more difficult and costly than generating more electricity from renewable (mainly wind and solar) conversions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpdr8hn7mwqt41dp1st2vm9))
- new and highly energy-intensive material dependencies are emerging and electric cars are their best example ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpe4hm1gnmc4bpkp175nvxf))
- A typical lithium car battery weighing about 450 kilograms contains about 11 kilograms of lithium, nearly 14 kilograms of cobalt, 27 kilograms of nickel, more than 40 kilograms of copper, and 50 kilograms of graphite‚Äîas well as about 181 kilograms of steel, aluminum, and plastics. Supplying these materials for a single vehicle requires processing about 40 tons of ores, and given the low concentration of many elements in their ores it necessitates extracting and processing about 225 tons of raw materials. And aggressive electrification of road transport would soon require multiplying these needs by tens of millions of units per year! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpe6dym8epn0gkgmdvzxndd))
- until all energies used to extract and process these materials come from renewable conversions, modern civilization will remain fundamentally dependent on the fossil fuels used in the production of these indispensable materials. No artificial intelligence designs, no apps, no claims of coming ‚Äúdematerialization‚Äù will change that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpe8mwczz9c10bn2gk5btta))
