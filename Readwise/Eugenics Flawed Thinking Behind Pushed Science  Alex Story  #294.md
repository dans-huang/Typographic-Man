- > everyone thinks their child is special and of course there's millions of children and you don't necessarily think that every child that you encounter on the street is special and then you might say well are you blind about your child or are you blind to every other child and I would say it's the second that's true is that you can actually see your children but you don't have enough mental energy or maybe enough breadth of character to see all other children and so maybe I've thought too that love in some sense is the grace 39:00of God you know is that if if you're in a relationship with someone that's characterized by love you see each other in some deep sense and you can't see other people like that because you don't have the ability but it's not like the love is a delusion it's the opposite of it ([TimeÂ 0:38:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=637906512da75b00081c7688))
- > if you're around someone that you love and that love defines the relationship there isn't any better thing you can do and so then to minimize that to call it some sort of biological or biochemical aberration which is the 40:00worst form of unconscionable reductionism is to reduce the highest possible goal to something that it's nothing but like a trivial consequence and some underlying materiality it's appalling and it's really demoralizing ([TimeÂ 0:39:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=6379069d2da75b00081c7689))
- > if you think about societies most people and you know most of us here want stability and yet what we keep being sold is change changes absence changes the only consonant you need to go for change change change and the faster the better yeah especially in the face of an emergency well exactly and so so what what does that lead to it leads to a confusion it can only lead to confusion if the one thing that you go for is 50:30change ([TimeÂ 0:50:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=637907562da75b00081c768a))
- > a scientific body of opinion never says you ought yeah as soon as someone says that the science says you ought they've made the Gap they've made the leap from is to Art and Science concentrates on is not on Art and so the idea that you can somehow blindly follow the science and also that your moral by doing so is about the most anti-scientific proposition that there could be ([TimeÂ 1:12:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=63790d402da75b00081c768c))
- > Malthus is important because he says too many human beings Keynes is important because he's the leading member of the British Eugenics Society then Marx is important because he just like um Keynes and and Malthus says that um that people belong in boxes in other words they're not humans they are what we say they are not what they want what the human being himself thinks he's biologicalism right or religion of the masses exactly and then you've got uh Darwin that comes in Darwin uh uh writes in particular about race uh uh and there are some very interesting quotes with him and uh and parliamentarians where he explains geopolitical changes including uh with the Ottoman Empire uh through the lens of race and the one of the the last um sentence of uh descent his last book is essentially I would rather be a um a descendant from a monkey than a Savage ([TimeÂ 1:32:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=6379101b22aee80008b1b699))
- > the reason why these four people matter is because they are deeply rooted in our educational framework uh whether it's in Canada the US France uh Germany these four characters represent biology economics politics and um what else uh sociology and so for me that's really important because that framework is essentially where most of our leaders have been uh have have grown up intellectually uh and so what's important about this is that they we have to escape in my view or we have to try and at least become really aware of what these ideas were in order for us to be able to extricate to extricate ourselves ([TimeÂ 1:33:15](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=637910548a18dd0008fe263f))
