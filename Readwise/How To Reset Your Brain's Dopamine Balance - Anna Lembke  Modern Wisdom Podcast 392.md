- > my framework for communicating the role that dopamine has in our brain it really has to do with the fact that pleasure and pain are processed in the 01:00same part of the brain it's a part of the brain called the reward pathway and pleasure and pain effectively work like opposite sides of a balance so when we do something pleasurable that balance tips to the side of pleasure and we get a little release of dopamine in our brain's reward pathway which is reinforcing and feels good but one of the overarching rules governing this balance is that it wants to remain level it doesn't want to be tipped for very long to the side of pleasure or pain 01:30and the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance or what's called homeostasis but importantly the way that the brain brings that balance back to a level resting state is first by tipping it an equal and opposite amount to the side of pain and that's where when our brain down regulates our own dopamine production and our own dopamine transmission not just back to baseline levels but actually below baseline levels to this 02:00dopamine deficit state now if we wait long enough you know that's that feeling of wanting another piece of chocolate just one more video game another drink if we wait that passes and our balance is restored but if we continue to repeatedly expose ourselves to highly reinforcing drugs and behaviors then over time that initial stimulus gets shorter and weaker but that after response gets stronger and longer 02:30which is why typically we need more of a drug or more potent forms over time to get the same effect and furthermore what can end up happening is our our balances can kind of get stuck on the pain side where we end up i like to think of it as these neural adaptation gremlins hopping on the pain side of our balance kind of camping out there if we bombard our brains with so much dopamine that our brains have to compensate by way down regulating our own dopamine production and transmission then we end up in this chronic dopamine 03:00deficit state where nothing else is enjoyable we're only focused on our drug of choice we need to keep using not to feel good but just to restore a level balance and feel normal and when we're not using our drug we're experiencing the universal symptoms of withdrawal from any addictive substance which are anxiety irritability insomnia depression and craving ([Time 0:00:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e903ca826dd9000961c6fb?annotationId=62e90449826dd9000961c6fe))
- > dopamine fluctuates around this tonic baseline so we're always releasing dopamine at sort of a constant steady rate and it's really the way it fluctuates up and down below this baseline level that affects the way we feel typically when it rises above baseline levels and we have more dopamine in our reward pathway we feel good we can feel really really good we can feel even euphoric or sometimes it's just a sense of calm well-being or a sense of not 04:00being anxious so it's all of those things wrapped into one whereas when dopamine goes below baseline again we feel restless we feel anxious we feel like something's missing in our life and we have a lot of incentive and motivation to use that drug again in order to not just recreate that good feeling but also just bring us back to a normal homeostasis ([Time 0:03:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e903ca826dd9000961c6fb?annotationId=62e9047278742b000966cb3c))
- > any kind of for any kind of reward seeking there is a cost and that cost is the come down and the pain and that the harder we try to be in that place of comfort and reward the larger the price that will pay the greater the dopamine deficit state such that ultimately there is futility um in seeking out reward for its own sake ([Time 0:05:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e903ca826dd9000961c6fb?annotationId=62e904a6826dd9000961c701))
- > essentially a person with chronic pain who starts out in pain their physiologic system will want to return to that baseline so for example if they take an opioid to try to get out of pain that will initially work but over time they'll need more and more of that opioid to get the same effect and ultimately the initial response to the opioid will get weaker and shorter 08:00in duration and the after effect and this is really probably the most fascinating aspect of this pleasure pain balance is that after effect gets stronger and longer so with repeated exposure to the same or similar pleasure stimulus we end up in a deeper dopamine deficit state it lasts longer it goes further down so a person with chronic pain has to experience that pain below even beyond their baseline pain before returning to 08:30their baseline pain so in other words there's no free lunch what goes up must come down and if you start out in chronic pain you're also subject to the same problems of tolerance needing more and more to get the same effect and the dependence and withdrawal which are essentially this dopamine deficit state it's a vicious asymmetry the fact that you need more and more to gain less and less pleasure but the more and more will incur an even larger power law return of depression and feeling bad on the other side ([Time 0:07:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e903ca826dd9000961c6fb?annotationId=62e904f578742b000966cb3f))
- > it's what has turned us into these constant seekers never happy with what we have always wanting more except that our ability to be constant seekers and always improve on our lives and on our circumstance has essentially allowed us to transform the world this 10:00is really you know we're living in the anthropocene in the sense that this is the first time in human history that we have used our brains and our technology to create more abundance than we could ever need or ever want and not just abundance these highly addictive highly reinforcing feel-good drugs and behaviors essentially making us all vulnerable to addiction because our primitive wiring wasn't adapted for the modern ecosystem ([Time 0:09:43](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e903ca826dd9000961c6fb?annotationId=62e9053378742b000966cb41))
- **Segway into Sex Addiction**
  正如荷蘭著名的理性主義者斯賓諾莎在其《知性改進論》中所寫道的那樣：「當體驗到『性快感』的時候，你的整個心智已經沉浸在這種愉悅中，並且平靜地享受著，根本心無旁鶩。但當『性快感』過後，巨大的悲傷感隨之而來。如果這種悲傷感沒有完全生成，那麼說明，你的心智還沒有從這種愉悅中恢復過來。」
  對此，德國哲學家叔本華說得更狠一些，「Directly after copulation, the devil’s laughter is heard」（交媾之後，魔鬼的邪笑接踵而至），所以，在《作為意志和表象的世界》（Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung）一書第四部分中，叔本華提供了一種以禁欲主義的方式來找到希望的可能。他認為人只有在擺脫一種強烈的欲望衝動的時候才能獲得其根本上的自由，只有打破意志對於行為本身的控制，才能獲得某種幸福的可能。 ([Time 0:11:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e903ca826dd9000961c6fb?annotationId=62e9069b4a13080009f25fa4))
- > all of these chemicals are involved but interestingly the final common pathway for all addictive substances and behaviors is dopamine um and you know that that it's essentially the currency that neuroscientists use to kind of measure the addictive potential of something ([Time 0:20:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e903ca826dd9000961c6fb?annotationId=62e90a5d4a13080009f25fa5))
