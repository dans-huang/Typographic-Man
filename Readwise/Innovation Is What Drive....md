- Innovation is what drives society forward and improves our quality of life. 
  @mattwridley lays out 10 general rules/observations that help us better understand the process of innovation, how to support it, and what it can mean for a society’s trajectory.

- 1. Innovation is Gradual
  “Eureka moments are rare, possibly non-existent..
  You can tell the story of the computer in lots of ways..but the deeper you look, the less likely you are to find a moment of sudden breakthrough, rather than a series of small incremental steps.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203093034991616))
- “Man-made technologies evolve from previous man-made technologies, and are not invented from scratch. This is a key characteristic of evolutionary systems: the move to the ‘adjacent possible step’”

- “All too often, the importing of a new idea gets confused with the inventing of a new idea. 
  Nationalism exacerbates the problem.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203106616152066))
- 2. Innovation ≠ Invention
  🧻The toilet-paper principle: ‘The most influential technologies are often humble and cheap’ -Tim Harford
  “Again and again.., it is the people who find ways to drive down the costs and simplify the product who make the biggest difference.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203111146000385))
- “The unexpected success of mobile telephony in the 1990s, which few saw coming, was caused not by any particular breakthrough in physics or technology, but by its sudden fall in prices.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203114115534848))
- 3. Innovation is often Serendipitous
  “Neither the founders of Yahoo! Nor those of Google set out in the search of search engines. The founders of twitter were trying to invent a way for people to find podcasts.
  It is a well-known attribute of innovation: accidental discovery.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203116745379843))
- 4. Innovation is Recombinant
  “Every technology is a combination of other existing technologies.
  The inventors of the motor car did not have to invent wheels, springs or steel.”
  https://t.co/oENlgqFQs8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203117621932037))
- “Recombination is the principal source of variation upon which natural selection draws."
  Innovation happens:
  -“when ideas have sex”
  -“in places where trade and exchange are frequent”
  -in populated areas ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203118678937607))
- 5. Innovation involves Trial and Error
  “During the early years of a new technology - the railway, for example, or the internet - far more entrepreneurs went broke than made fortunes.
  Innovators who just like playing around are more likely to find something unexpected.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203119538806784))
- “Edison perfected the light bulb not by inspiration but by perspiration: he and his team tested 6,000 different materials for the filament.”
  ‘I’ve not failed, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work’ - Thomas Edison ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203120419606533))
- 6. Innovation is a Team Sport
  “The myth of the lonely inventor, the solitary genius, is hard to shake.”
  [it] always requires collaboration and sharing, as exemplified by the fact that even the simplest object or process is beyond the capacity of any one human to understand.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203121338142725))
- “One person may make a technological breakthrough, another work out how to manufacture it and a third how to make it cheap enough to catch on. All are part of the innovation process and none of them knows how to achieve the whole innovation.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203122223079429))
- 7. Innovation is Inexorable
  “People seem to stumble on the same idea at the same time. 
  In 1922 Ogburn & Thomas at Columbia Uni produced a list of 148 cases of near-simultaneous invention by more than one person..
  Simultaneous invention is more the rule than the exception.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203123137507331))
- “Many ideas for technology just seem to be ripe, and ready to fall from the tree.
  It was impossible for search engines not to be invented in the 1990s, and impossible for light bulbs not to be invented in the 1870s. They were inevitable.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203124009934850))
- “The lesson this teaches..[is] the individual is strangely dispensable. 
  Maybe things take longer, have a slightly different look and get different names. But the innovations still happen.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203124940988416))
- “Technology is absurdly predictable in retrospect, wholly unpredictable in prospect. Thus predictions of technological change nearly always look very foolish. 
  Anticipating what people want is something innovators are good at; academics less so.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203125813485570))
- 8. Innovation’s Hype Cycle
  “Amara’s Law states that people tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short run, but underestimate it in the long run.” 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5y0wZyVcAEETe-.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203128816570371))
- “We expect too much of an innovation in the first ten years and too little in the first twenty, but get it about right looking fifteen years ahead.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203130146189312))
- “I suspect that the Amara hype cycle can be detected today in the story of artificial intelligence, a technology whose promise has long disappointed. Thanks to graphics chips, new algorithms and lots of data, at last AI might be on the brink of not fading away.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203131064782854))
- 9. Innovation Prefers Fragmented Governance
  “One of the peculiar features of history is that empires are bad at innovation. 
  Though they have wealthy and educated elites, [they] tend to preside over gradual declines in inventiveness, which contribute to their eventual undoing.” 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5y0wuUUcAYeERU.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203137268125698))
- “The Ottoman and Mughal empires managed to ban [the printing press] for more than three centuries. 
  This was an unholy alliance: the calligraphers defending their monopoly in cahoots with the priests defending their religious monopoly, by successfully lobbying the authorities” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203138773852161))
- “As time goes by and the central power ossifies, technology tends to stagnate, elites tend to resist novelty and funds get diverted into luxury, war or corruption, rather than enterprise.”
  https://t.co/qhxjVVpY43 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203139889491968))
- “For at least a thousand years, innovation has disproportionately happened in cities, and especially self-governing ones. 
  ..infrastructure scales at a sublinear rate, but the socio-economic products of a city scale at a super-linear rate.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203141235941378))
- 10. Innovation increasingly means using fewer resources rather than more
  “Those who say that indefinite growth is impossible, or at least unsustainable, in a world of finite resources are therefore wrong, for a simple reason: growth can take place through doing more with less.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203142393565186))
- “More food from less land and less water; more miles for less fuel; more communication for less electricity; more buildings for less steel; more transistors for less silicon; more correspondence for less paper..” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203519948001281))
- “In the ten years from 2008, America’s economy grew by 15 per cent but its energy use fell by 2 per cent.
  It’s because of economies and efficiencies created by innovation."
  https://t.co/CQSxsfHHaS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203520883281927))
- “It will always be possible to raise living standards by lowering the amount of a resource that is used to produce a given output. Growth is therefore indefinitely ‘sustainable’.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1413203522590416896))
