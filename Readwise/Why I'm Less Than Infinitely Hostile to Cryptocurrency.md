- I think a lot of Westerners want to think of developing-world uses as a boring sideshow, and highlight Westerners trading monkey gifs as the only part of crypto worth talking about. But about 66% of crypto users live in the developing world. [More people own cryptocurrency in Africa than in North America](https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/). Of *course* a technology centered around avoiding governance and banking failures will be centered in the countries with the most governance and banking failures!

- So why do people think everything in crypto is a scam?
  Crypto is a few hundred interesting projects, plus a long tail of thousands of scams. If you‚Äôre a knowledgeable person using crypto for some legitimate reason, you‚Äôll use some well-regarded crypto platform and probably not get scammed. If you live in a developed country with a good banking system, and you have no legitimate use cases, your engagement with cryptocurrency may be entirely through clicking on spam emails that say ‚ÄúMAKE 1000% MONTHLY RETURNS WITH MOONCOIN‚Äù and wiring them your life savings. In this case you will definitely get scammed. Depending on which of those two categories people are in, and which of those two categories the media covers, you can end up thinking crypto is 100% scams or 0% scams.

- This isn‚Äôt so different from other fields like education. There are 8 Ivy League schools in the US, [400](https://www.statista.com/statistics/239962/doctorate-granting-institutions-in-the-us/) high-quality research universities, and about [1,000](https://wenr.wes.org/2017/12/diploma-mills-9-strategies-for-tackling-one-of-higher-educations-most-wicked-problems) fraudulent diploma mills. Higher education is full of scams! If you‚Äôre a knowledgeable person following a normal educational track, you‚Äôll probably be fine. If you click on spam emails that say ‚ÄúGET A PHD IN TWO WEEKS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PHEONIX‚Äù and wire them your life savings, you won‚Äôt be fine. I‚Äôm not blaming the scamees here - they‚Äôre usually poor people who lack the tacit knowledge that the upper class use to navigate the education system. But if you do have that tacit knowledge, and you stick to doing things the slow way without taking any too-good-to-be-true deals, you don't have to worry about scams that much. This is also how I feel about crypto[4](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-im-less-than-infinitely-hostile#footnote-4-85488768).

- 6259 [writes](https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1494444624630403083?lang=en): there are no other rights in substance without the freedom to transact.
  That is: Freedom of speech is hollow if you can‚Äôt pay the print costs for your magazine. Freedom of religion is hollow if you can‚Äôt pay the rent on your church. The freedom to protest is hollow if you can‚Äôt pay bus fare to the protest site. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg94jhns6vmtj6gccqskpqd))
- If the government hates Islam, it‚Äôs hard from a legal and PR perspective to imprison imams or ban the Koran. But it‚Äôs easy to subtly convey to banks that it will regulate them out of existence unless they ban transactions to imams, or to any bookstores that carry Korans. And this has pretty much the same effect.
  The most obvious example of this is the way [Paypal bans sex workers](https://tryst.link/blog/financial-discrimination-against-sex-workers-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/) (including sometimes confiscating the money in their accounts). I don‚Äôt think the CEO of Paypal is personally a prude. I think he‚Äôs afraid that he‚Äôll get in trouble with the government if he looks like he‚Äôs soft on ‚Äúpublic indecency‚Äù. Without any official diktats that could become a Supreme Court case, the government successfully makes sex work punishingly hard.
  Recently I‚Äôve seen this expand from sex work to [erotic fiction](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/payment-processors-are-still-policing-your-sex-life) to [medical marijuana](https://mgmagazine.com/cannabis-news/cannabis-payment-problem/?doing_wp_cron=1669442490.3007938861846923828125) to [expressing opinions dubbed ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/10/paypal-faces-backlash-after-floating-fines-sharing-misinformation/). One weird supplement company I liked [almost had to shut down](https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/jyeeyh/will_there_ever_be_a_paypal_option_to_pay/gd3trj8/), not because the government said anything they were selling was illegal, but because payment processors thought it was *the kind of thing* that someone wouldn‚Äôt like, and refused to take their money. I don‚Äôt think the CEO of Visa is personally opposed to weird supplements, I think it‚Äôs the same kind of soft government collusion that‚Äôs been revealed to be going on at Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else.
  This tactic reached a new level during the 2021 Ottawa protests, where the Canadian government [told banks to freeze the accounts of suspected protesters](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/americas/canada-trucker-protest-covid-sunday). All of a sudden their families couldn‚Äôt afford food and they had to back down. This is a very effective anti-protester tactic, and there‚Äôs no reason that governments who don‚Äôt like people protesting them (eg all governments) shouldn‚Äôt try it in the future.

- Governments can take lots of actions against crypto. They can ban it. They can prevent banks from accepting it. They can search the blockchain to hunt down users. But governments take lots of actions against protests, tax evasion, and drugs, and those things still often succeed. The point isn‚Äôt that governments can‚Äôt ban a thing and send police after anyone who does it. The point is that there are only so many officers and detectives. If you make something too annoying to crush, the government will put in a half-hearted effort but mostly redirect resources elsewhere.

- Yes, The Crypto Financial System Is Just Reinventing The Regular Financial System Except Worse In Every Way, And That‚Äôs Fine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg9c6hchhrk4cw6202sd40m))
- The space program has existed for more than fifty years, and mostly succeeded at reinventing things we already have on Earth, only worse. Remember the story of that special astronaut pen that cost $1 million? We already have pens on earth, for like $0.10, and they work better! The lunar rover is just a car, only worse. That robocopter that flew around Mars is just a drone, only worse. We spent $100 billion building the International Space Station, which is basically just a big house in space. But we already have houses on Earth which are cheaper and more comfortable in every way! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg9c7k4b356gnkg8ns0veym))
- The only excuse for any of this is: yes, but it‚Äôs *in* *space*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg9c939pt2fqxrpcbxx38jz))
- In the same way, everything about the crypto economy is worse than the regular economy. The only excuse is that it‚Äôs decentralized. This means you can use it for all of those cool things - sending remittances, circumventing corrupt banking systems, resisting authoritarian governments - that are hard to do with regular money. Of *course* subjecting yourself to a difficult constraint is going to be harder than not doing that! You don‚Äôt hate the International Space Station for being worse than houses on Earth. You marvel at the fact that anyone can live in space at all! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmg9ccjrvptpydc5fj7pq9q3))
- If nothing‚Äôs wrong with your country‚Äôs financial or political system, then you don‚Äôt need crypto. If you use crypto anyway, it will be worse than your regular financial system, because it‚Äôs trading off many things you need (efficiency, speed, safety, the good kinds of regulation) for something you don‚Äôt need (avoiding the bad kinds of regulation).
