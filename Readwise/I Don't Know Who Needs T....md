  3. Legal system co-opted by state
  4. Power exerted to prevent dissent ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bfcarlson/status/1600491829094383621))
- 5. State police protect not the people, but the regime
  6. Financial, legal, civil rights contingent on compliance

  10. Propaganda targets enemies of state
  11. Whole classes scapegoated and singled out for persecution
  12. Extra-legal action against internal enemies is condoned ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bfcarlson/status/1600491833469145090))
- 13. Unpredictable and harsh enforcement against unfavored classes
  14. Language of constitution serves as facade for exercise of power
  15. All private and public levers of power used to enforce adherence to state orthodoxy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bfcarlson/status/1600491835683749889))
