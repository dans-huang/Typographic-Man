- asour new century unfolds one of our
  greatest challenges is to build andnurture sustainable communities that issocial cultural and physicalenvironments in which we can satisfy ourneeds and our aspirations withoutdiminishing the chances of futuregenerations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqytsv3a94hjnphggj6305g7))
- what is sustained in asustainable community it's not economicgrowth or development or competitive
  advantage what is sustained is the webof life on which our long-term survivaldepends in other words the sustainablecommunity is designed in such a way thatits ways of life its technologies andits sociallyoceans honor support and cooperate with
  nature's inherent ability to sustainlife ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqytvp6rhnymg85jnfjvymfe))
    - Note: its technologies and its social institutions
- the first step in this endeavornaturally is to understand how naturedoes it how does nature sustain lifehow have ecosystems evolved to sustainthe web of lifethis understanding is what I have cometo call ecological literacy or ecoliteracy in the coming decades the
  survival of humanity will depend on howecological literacy our ability tounderstand the basic principles ofecology and to live accordingly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqytx9k8esmcgaa1msmdccqn))
- as faras science is concerned the mostappropriate framework for ecology is thetheory of living systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqytyxwdjy2vvc9wxbk6k47p))
- examples ofliving systems which were studied in all
  those fields abound in nature everyorganism an animal a plant amicroorganism or human oris an integrated whole and therefore theliving system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv17w3hgrfz32gewakv5cp))
- throughout the living world wefind systems nesting within system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv1t50vh257kh3p170ya2r))
- the difference between the livingorganism and the dead organism lies inthe basic process of life in whatphilosophers and poets throughout theages have called the
  of life and this breath of life themodern scientific language is calledmetabolism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv2x93hb82kexh2dsv7ebs))
- metabolism is the ceaselessflow of energy matter through the livingorganism or any living system through anetwork of chemical reactions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv3trtrgvhbat3fv5bczaa))
- that
  enables the living organism tocontinually maintain itself regenerateitself and perpetuate itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv46wrszx63zz1mpfct95g))
- the understanding of metabolism hastwo basic aspects one is the continuousflow of energy and matter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv5wt2qwjc9m564xeeb2zn))
- the second aspect ofmetabolism is the network of chemical
  reactions that processes the food theenergy of matter of coursecome into the organism are the food andthis network of chemical reactions formsthe basis of all the functions andbehavior of the organism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv6h6jj8yffxgh846xabvh))
- inconclusion I want to emphasize that myextension of the systemic conception oflife to the social domain it explicitlyincludes the material world as I said it
  is an integration of three componentsthree dimensions of life the materialthe cognitive and the social ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv7fjawp4wcp2816hbe8n2))
- the key challenge ofour new century for social scientistsnatural scientists and everyone elsewill be to build ecologicallysustainable communities and they need tobe designed in such a way that itstechnologies and social institutions inother words its material and socialstructures do not interfere with
  nature's inherent ability to sustainlife ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv99920t6fbnf2xk6v2d3w))
- in other words the designprinciples of our future socialinstitutions must be consistent with theprinciples of organization that naturehas evolved to sustain the web of lifeand to create such social institutionswe need a unified conceptual frameworkfor the understanding of material andsocial structures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyv9qa0bvw26kg7gxe61s01))
