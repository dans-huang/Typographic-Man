- **Crucial Realizations on Energy**
  1. Cheap, plentiful, reliable energy is far more important to human flourishing than I thought.
  2. It's also far more difficult to produce, therefore to replace than I thought.
  Energy industry is the industry that powers all other industries.
  When energy is cheap and reliable, everything else becomes cheap and reliable, and the reverse is true.
  There's been a lot of competition for energy sources, but fossil fuels win out because they're simply cheaper, more plentiful and more reliable.
  There're 3 problems with energy debate:
  1. Biased: Many often only look at the positives for certain energies, and only look at the negatives for the others.
  2. Sloppy: People only ask if one believe in climate change is real or not, if sea level rise real or not, but never bother to look into the magnitude of the impacts that climate change is making. They don't look at the full context.
  3. Anti-human: When many people are talking about climate, they think it's simply better to be 'natural' and to minimize human impact. They implicitly think humans are uniquely anti-planet creature that's polluting the planet, instead of looking for solutions to perfect our condition and maximize human flourishing by looking at intelligently transitioning methods.
  - Full context & Pro-Human (Maximize Human Flourishing) :
  Potential unique benefits (access to energy, CO2), potential unique risks (CO2, pollution, depletion) for human flourishing ([TimeÂ 0:03:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15113397a000956d72a?annotationId=6340411416b11b0009be19d2))
- Fossil fuels have been the fastest growing energy source despite many promises on solar and wind. The economics tell us more clearly what the globe has decided to go with as their main source of energy.
  **Every energy technology is a resource-intensive process - some are much more resource-intensive than others.**
  That includes but not limited to mining, processing, manufacturing, transportation, operation, maintenance, and disposal.
  So when people talking about things like zero emissions or no pollution, usually they're only talking about one part of the process. And when people have wildly optimistic expectations about some new source of energy like hydrogen, they have no idea what goes into producing the hydrogen fuel.
  There's many things that'll make an energy expensive, and the biggest one and the most problematic part of a process, is if the process is unreliable. And that's clearly the issue with solar and wind - They should be called "unreliables" instead of "renewables". That's why Germany pays 3 to 4 times higher electricity bill than the US, and only 10% comes from solar and wind in Germany.
  Thus if you look at the data, we'll have to conclude that fossil fuel energy, for the next several decades, is uniquely good at producing energy on a scale of billions of people. Nuclear power probably has the most potential too, except for the green movement is restricting it.

- Global energy facts:
  1.2 billion humans without access to electricity, including 512 millions in Asia, 634 millions in Africa - No electricity, no light bulb, no refrigerator, no modern hospital, none.
  2.7 billon humans rely on biomass for cooking and heating.
  -> The unique benefits of fossil fuel use place an extremely high burden of proof on any restrictive proposals. ([TimeÂ 0:24:41](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15113397a000956d72a?annotationId=634044b216b11b0009be19d4))
- To understand oil, we shouldn't think of it as that nature just give us a lake of oil, and we're draining it with a straw and we're half way through it. Nature is full of potential oil in all these different rock deposits, but it takes human ingenuity to make them valuable, to find it, get it, and refine it.
  So the principle that's very important to having optimism about humanity, if we care about energy, is that human beings are resource producers or resource creators. Nature gives us a raw material and we make it usable.
  All these current resources we have are only resources because humans can transform them into usable things, and the whole world is just a pile of potential resources. So we should never be worried about running out of oil, coal or natural gas, we should only be worried about running out of freedom. Because as long as we're free, we can keep figuring out ways to transform raw materials into resources, and our effective intelligence just multiplies over and over.

- There's this idea that there's clean energy and dirty energy. That's a problem first of all, because every form of energy in the process can pollute the environment in different ways.
  The thing that's really missing from this narrative, is that energy has an enormous power to clean up nature. The environment we live in is by average the cleanest environment we've ever lived in. Nature doesn't give us a clean environment that we then make dirty, it gives us a dirty environment that we make clean.
  So when we're analyzing the environmental impact of different forms of energy, we have to look at both how it cleans and how it makes things dirty. An obvious example is how the fossil fuel usage for the past decades significantly improved water source. Of course it doesn't have to be fossil fuel but given that fossil fuel is the most practical form of energy today for billions of people today, it does have to be fossil fuels.

- Accessing Climate Livability:
  1. The greenhouse effect - warming impact of CO2
  2. The fertilizer effect - planet growth promoting aspect of CO2
  3. The protection effect - energy given to people helps them be protected from climate
  In the 30s, 1 to 5 millions people die every year from the climate. And in recent years, it hardly passes 10,000. ([TimeÂ 0:32:57](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15113397a000956d72a?annotationId=63404bf269b0930009e7dd75))
