- > trusting The Sciences is fine if it's kept to the things at which science is competent but unfortunately over the past few years there has developed a trust in science that we now call scientism where science is regarded essentially as the only way to truth the only option for a rational thinking person and everything else is fairy stories and all the rest of it and I take a great exception to that because it's plainly false it's false logically because the very statement science is the only way to truth is not a statement of Science and so if it's true it's false so it's logically incoherent to start with ([TimeÂ 0:02:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218289faf610008f5d8d0))
- > people like the late Stephen Hawking for example who wrote in one of his books he he said that philosophy is dead and it seems now as if scientists are holding the torch of truth and that's that's scientism the irony of it is of course that he wrote it in the book where it's all about philosophy of science and it's pretty clear that Hawking brilliant as he was as a mathematical physicist really is a classic Exemplar of what Albert Einstein once said the scientist is a poor philosopher ([TimeÂ 0:03:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=6382188c9faf610008f5d8d1))
- > it's so very easy to see that science meaning the Natural Sciences are limited in that they cannot answer the simple questions of a child where do I come from where am I going to and what is the meaning of life and it seems to me immensely important that we recover that and what metaphor went on to say is we need literature we need philosophy and we need theology as well in my view in order to answer the bigger questions ([TimeÂ 0:04:15](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218a99faf610008f5d8d2))
- > science takes things apart to understand how they work and I suppose to understand what they're made of religion puts them together to see what they mean and I think that encapsulates the danger in which we're standing science has spawned technology we've become addicted to technology particularly the more advanced forms of it like AI in my book like virtual reality the metaverse all this kind of stuff we've come addicted to it but we've lost a sense of real meaning and in particular we've lost our moral con Compass ([TimeÂ 0:05:12](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218c69faf610008f5d8d3))
- > Einstein again to quote him made the point long ago he said you can speak of the ethical foundations of science but you cannot speak of the scientific foundations of ethics science doesn't tell you what you ought to do it will tell you of course if you put strict name in your granny's tea it will give her a very hard time in fact it's killer but I can't tell you whether you ought to do it or not to get your hands on her property and so we're left in a scientistic moral vacuum and therefore I feel very strongly that as a scientist of sorts I need to challenge this ([TimeÂ 0:05:51](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218ee9faf610008f5d8d4))
- > science is marvelous but it's limited to the questions that can handle and let's realize it does not deal with the most important questions of life and they're the question of who am I what can life and does life mean and where do we get a moral compass ([TimeÂ 0:06:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218f39faf610008f5d8d5))
- > narrow AI system is a system involving high powered computer a huge database and an algorithm that does some picking and choosing that whose output is something that it normally requires human intelligence to do that is if you look at the output you would say normally that it's taken an intelligent person to do that ([TimeÂ 0:15:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=63bae95bbb592c0008682340))
