- > god is ipsum essay subsistence god is the subsistent act of to be itself 01:00another way to state that in aquinas is god is that reality unique absolutely unique in which essence and existence coincide to be god is to be to be those are all ways of talking about what we mean by god they are kind of gnomic and that's on purpose there's almost a zen koan kind of quality about the way we talk about god i'm saying something that's substantive but it's more in like a via negative mode it's more like what god is not because there's nothing in the world 01:30that would correspond to those descriptions ([TimeÂ 0:00:53](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e003bbf85fb100096dafba))
- > to say in god essence and existence coincide is to say god's very nature is to be and that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world so what i'm doing there is i'm i'm gesturing the way the tradition does toward god using language that's at the same time philosophically precise and gnomic you 02:30know it's both accurate it's true god essence and existence coincide what god is is the same as god's uh active to be but now what does that mean i'm not quite sure because nothing in our ordinary experience corresponds to that everything in our experience is is a being of some type so it's existence received according to the mode of some essence that's not true of god which is why you can't be found in the world ([TimeÂ 0:02:12](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e3628e3e82450009869efe))
- > our knowledge begins always in this world begins in ordinary experience 04:00but i think we can through metaphysical analysis through philosophical reasoning can come to some knowledge of a reality which is transcendent to our experience so we gesture toward it i always like aquinas who says the language about god that we use is analogical so it's not it's not univocal meaning what i say about that you know can or about this bottle i can say about god no that makes god an entity at the same time it's not simply equivocal so if i say well that thing is and god is i mean 04:30totally different things no no i mean something analogous so to be god is to be to be so the real meaning of being is the being of god the being of that thing or this thing or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles would be analogous to god's manner of being so on that basis i can make some statements i can i can theorize and even at the limit as you suggest i can visualize so we have metaphors for god and 05:00the bible is replete with those rights god is a rock uh you know god's like a lion god's like this and that or the bible will sometimes imagine god as a as a human being walking around you know now only the crude fundamentalism would say well that's a universal accurate description of god it's an image that's catching something of god's manner of being ([TimeÂ 0:03:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e362f9c879dd00096fbe9e))

- > i just came across it recently and discovered this whole literature around it is eugene vigner's article in 1960 called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics to the physical sciences i think that's the title of it or effectiveness or something like that yeah but what's so cool is you know he's not a religious man he was a kind of a secular jew but yet he uses the word miracle like eight times in that article and because he just is so impressed by the fact that high complex mathematics describes so accurately the physical world and can be used to to create things and to manipulate and why should that be true that there's something very weirdly mysterious about that relationship you know and i would say it's because you you stepped into a higher order of being which is inclusive of a lower level of being that's the platonic approach is that as you move now i'm going to different metaphor you move to higher levels they're inclusive of the lower levels ([TimeÂ 1:10:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5f5bfa544d90009c827e0))

- > the other thing i find really interesting is equality because um look in classical philosophy political philosophy plato aristotle cicero it's not equality for them it's our inequality that's really interesting so plato divides us into these three classes and aristotle says only a tiny little coterie of property males of sufficient education should be in the political life the rest should all be in private life you know and then some are suited for slavery so i mean he divides us dramatically same with cicero and so on um where does this come from this weird idea that we're all equal i mean how we're not equal in beauty not equal in strength we're not equal in moral attainment we're not equal in intelligence so what is it and i think the residue especially comes through in that little word that all men are created equal that's our equality that we're all equally children of god so take god out of the picture i think we are going to slide rapidly into an embrace of inequality now in the classical world yes but heck look at the 20th century i mean when god is excluded in a very systematic way i think you saw the suspension of rights and the suspension of equality like mad so i think it's very important that god is in the picture and that we're a nation under god it matters enormously that's not pious boilerplate that's at the at the rational foundations of our democracy ([TimeÂ 1:27:36](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e67744558811000905472b))
