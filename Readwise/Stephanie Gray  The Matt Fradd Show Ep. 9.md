- > I think they would say it comes down to autonomy we are a culture obsessed with autonomy obsessed with choice and control and so people in support of abortion would argue that it's about my bodily autonomy my right to control my body and therefore if I want to have an abortion which is something that involves my body 14:00being laid down on the abortionist table then I should be allowed to access that ([TimeÂ 0:13:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8173439485f00095eff85))
- > we know that it is not just the woman's body that's involved when she has an abortion you know like increasingly I'm saying when I do debates in different lectures on the topic I will say to the audience when a woman takes a pregnancy 15:30test and she's not yet seen the results and but she doesn't want to be pregnant if the test comes negative yep will she go to an abortion clinic and they're always like no obviously not and then I say okay but if the test comes up positive and she doesn't want to be pregnant will she then consider going to the abortion clinic they say yes and they say I say okay well what is it that the positive test is telling her versus what the negative test is telling where the negative test is basically saying it's just your body don't worry it's just you 16:00but the moment she has a positive pregnancy test that's telling her it's no longer just her body there's another body there that's why she's thinking about going to the abortion clinic and action she would never take if she had the negative test so the very fact that she's now going to the abortion clinic is an admission there's another body present so what about that body's bodily autonomy what about that individuals choice what about that in so then suddenly it becomes the choice I could make to lay my body down 16:30on the abortionist table is a choice that if I'm pregnant is going to impact another body and if I believe in bodily rights and I need to protect the bodily rights of that pre born human being ([TimeÂ 0:15:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8178639485f00095eff86))
- > so all of the physiological reactions a woman has when she's pregnant is because of the presence of another body and so therefore if there's another body then 18:00how do we treat that other body how ought we treat that other body and that's actually an important distinction it's not what can I do the question is what should I do we can yes yes I can do almost anything yes the question is should I do that in a civil society in a society that believes all humans are equal in a society that believes in the fundamental human right to life should I take this course of action ([TimeÂ 0:17:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b817c739485f00095eff87))
- > there's there's two approaches that we need to take there's the approach of the heart and the approach of the head and I think we need to start with the former we need to acknowledge that anyone who's been victimized by sexual assault has been victimized that they've been traumatized that that is a brutal assault for which there really aren't words to capture how vile it is I have not been a victim of sexual assault but I have many friends who are and who have 19:30been and I have seen the lifelong trauma that that has brought to their lives so while I can't say I've personally experienced it I have observed through friendship the impact that that has had on people who have personally experienced that and I can acknowledge that that is a terrible thing and those people who have been hurt need our support they need our loved our compassion and counseling and so on and so forth the question we then need to ask moving from the heart to the head so there's an expression of sympathy and 20:00then this introduction of logic we'll abortion unwrapped a rape victim will it undo the trauma will it take away the evil that is happening ([TimeÂ 0:19:06](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b818075007ba0009a41dba))
- > so we acknowledge that there's some reminder but we can't acknowledge that to the point that to think that if we took that particular reminder away 21:00that we'd be eliminating all other reminders that there wouldn't be things there the next point I would make is that I would ask the question is it fair to give the death penalty to the innocent child that's a consequence we don't even give to the rapist in America ([TimeÂ 0:20:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8186e39485f00095eff88))
- > generally abortion 22:00supporters I find are not supporters of the death penalty so these are individuals that wouldn't give the death penalty to a rapist they wouldn't give the death penalty to a murderer so then we ask if you won't give the death penalty to guilty people why would you ever consider giving the death penalty to an innocent person that in the circumstance of rape the guilty party is not the preborn child the guilty party is not the woman the guilty party is the rapist so we're now talking with the act of abortion about giving a consequence a punishment to the 22:30innocent party that we're not even giving to the guilty party and even if we were giving that to the guilty party I think we should all agree that no innocent person should ever paid the price of a crime that they themselves have not committed so I would make the point that abortion is not gonna unwrap a rape victim it is not going to take away the memories that she's been traumatized and then most foundationally we in an in a society that supports human rights may not give punishment for 23:00a crime that the individual being punished has actually not committed that they're not guilty of ([TimeÂ 0:21:59](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8189839485f00095eff89))
- > Peter singer who is a professor at Princeton University kind of would argue that a person is someone who's rational conscious or self-aware and so the abortion supporter will say even if biologically you're human the embryo at say in in in the first few weeks of pregnancy even the fetus you know in the first trimester and so forth they will say well that entity is not rational 24:30conscious or self-aware in that moment and therefore even if biologically human is not a person so I wouldn't say okay well if our definition of a person in therefore what gives you the right to life and what stops me from being able to kill you definition of a person is the rational rational conscious or self aware right now what about when you're having surgery and you're under anaesthetic in that moment you're not rational conscious or self-aware if surgery is happening and I look at you and I say can I kill you you're not 25:00going to respond back and say no please don't because you're under anaesthetic if you're sleeping and I whisper while you're sleeping Matt may I kill you you're not gonna say no please don't kill me because you're not rational conscious and self aware at that moment I took the way you are right now and we still acknowledge you're a person because we would say by virtue of being human you have the inherent capacity built into your human nature to be rational conscious or self-aware but you can't currently express that due to your circumstances of sleeping or being under anaesthetic in the same way by virtue of 25:30being human the embryo or fetus of human parents has within his or her nature the capacity to be rational conscious or self-aware but cannot currently express that because of her age so when you're sleeping you can't express it because of your circumstances and that can change quickly in the embryos case the embryo may not express it because of the embryos age which will change as the embryo gets older but our right to life ought to be grounded in our existence 26:00not in how old we are and the embryo cannot act on certain abilities because of the embryos age and human rights aren't based on age they're based on existence as a member of the human family ([TimeÂ 0:24:07](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b818e2ddbfc10009dda900))
- > so the fact that you have experienced being rational conscious and self-aware right now and then you might lose that ability to currently act on that if you're under anesthetic if you're sleeping and then you're going to come out of those situations and act again the fact that you've previously had this experience why does that matter 27:00in contrast to the embryo who has not yet had that experience why is that relevant I would ask the abortion supporter to articulate why ([TimeÂ 0:26:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81904548ef0000979697f))
- > so I would say the point is that it is wrong to kill a human not because the human feels pain at the time of killing not because the human is aware at the time of killing but because the individual being killed is a human and so whether the preborn child feels pain or not is aware or not can respond or not isn't relevant what's relevant is is 29:00this child a member of the human family and that's why with abortion supporters I like to use reference reference to the United Nations which is often perceived as being a pro-abortion institution but if you look at their foundational documents they are profoundly pro-life the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says all members of the human family have the right to life and then they say an article 6 everyone ought to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law well who's everyone well the preamble 29:30talks about all members of the human family so since the preborn child is a member of the human family by virtue of having human parents than article 6 applies to them as much as it applies to you and me that by members by being members of the human family they ought to be recognized as persons everywhere before the law ([TimeÂ 0:28:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81957ddbfc10009dda901))
- > if you could have two women yeah in the in the same country who have committed crimes that 30:30according to that country's law are worthy of the death penalty one woman is pregnant one woman is not both of them are guilty if only one of the two under that law is going to be killed because she's not pregnant since both are guilty that's an admission that within the body of the pregnant woman is an innocent party and we don't kill innocent people for crimes that they haven't committed so interestingly not only is it the existence of a preborn child that saves some mothers from being killed by the 31:00death penalty but the point is it's an acknowledgment that in her body is an innocent party and so we don't kill innocent people for crimes they haven't committed ([TimeÂ 0:30:22](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81986ddbfc10009dda902))
- > first of all I that there is a difference between the pregnancy in that when a woman is pregnant she in the vast majority of cases has consented to the act of sex which brought about to the pregnancy so in the case of the violinist you were kidnapped and plugged 36:00into this person without your consent but for the vast majority of circumstances where women are pregnant they've consented to the act of sex and since pregnancy is a possible consequence they have to accept that kind of like if you play baseball with your child in the street and your son hits the ball and it goes through your neighbor's window you can't say to your neighbor you know I can sent it to play baseball but I didn't consent to the ball going through your window so I'm not going to pay for your window to be fixed if your neighbor took you to small claims court he would be able to argue 36:30that by virtue of playing baseball in an area where there was glass there was there was an inherent risk associated with that of breaking someone's window and by entering into the game you have to embrace the consequence and therefore pay to fix the window ([TimeÂ 0:35:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81a38ebdd6f000afe490a))
- > when you have to pay child support right so imagine you have a couple have sex I they break up woman finds out she's pregnant hmm goes something the husband was denied even the husband right they're not married so let's say he doesn't want the child and let's say that she doesn't tell him that she's pregnant they broke up but she decides that she wants to carry through with the pregnancy when the baby's born she 38:30realizes hey I need some financial help yeah so she goes they do paternity tests he finds out he is indeed the biological father and she says you owe me child support now imagine if he came back and said hey I can send it to the sex but I sure didn't consent to this pregnancy I'm not paying for child support yet most women would want to slap him yes and when if she takes him to court over this matter the court will rule in her favor that by virtue of engaging in the act of sex and creating this human being that he has to accept the consequences 39:00which is the existence of a human being who's vulnerable and needy and requires financial provision and therefore he has a duty to pay child support so if we expect that of the men shouldn't we expect that of the women ([TimeÂ 0:38:08](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81a86776a6b0009c73429))
- > parents have a responsibility to their offspring that we don't have to strangers so the nature of me in bed for example with the violinist is I don't 39:30know this person so it's nice of me to use my body to help them you could choose to do that crap you know I say if you don't look at it correct there's no obligation there's no moral duty to do that and that is the difference we could say when it comes to pregnancies it's a parent-child relationship which is then where we can deal with those exceptions where someone hasn't consented in the case of sexual assault and nonetheless gets pregnant while they haven't consented to the act that brought about the pregnancy by virtue of being the parent of the child biologically the rape victim is the mother of the 40:00offspring parents have a responsibility to care for their offspring in a way they don't have a responsibility for strangers so if a child is starving in your city it's nice of you to go to a homeless shelter and and and work to provide food but if you don't volunteer at a homeless shelter to help starving children or adults you're you're not going to be found guilty of breaking a law by refusing to serve the homeless but if 40:30your child in your home is starving and you're refusing to feed your child you will be found legally and morally responsible for it neglect ([TimeÂ 0:39:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81aaf776a6b0009c7342a))
- > I think it's to say that we have a duty to help the vulnerable what makes rape wrong it's that you have a vulnerable party who is attacked by a stronger party okay what makes abortion wrong so have a vulnerable party that is attacked by a stronger party that is in no way intended to minimize the gravity or the trauma of a sexual assault it's to simply make the point that when injustice happens when terrible things 42:00happen it doesn't give the victims license to do just anything in response I would argue that a victim of sexual assault who becomes pregnant doesn't have to raise the child the question is in a certain window of time where no one else can care for the child is there a responsibility to meet the basic needs of the child so again by way of analogy we could imagine you know let's say that you're kidnapped and you're kidnapped alongside a newborn 42:30baby who's been kidnapped and you find yourself you've been you know you were knocked out and then you wake up in a cabin which is locked there's no way of getting out it's like boarded up and you're in the middle of nowhere and you discovered that you're kidnapped with with a child who's of no relation to you and in this cabin interestingly there is formula there's water and there are bottles there is a capacity no there's no great kind of heroic virtue that's 43:00realized for me to support this child right it's right there and I are you related to this child no but this is the basic needs of the child so do you have a duty even though you've been a victim of kidnapping to meet the basic needs of the child in your presence who's incapable of meeting those needs and when you're freed hopefully from this situation you don't have to go on and raise the child yes now so the abortion supporter might then say well then if you have to help the 43:30child in the cabin in the woods where you're both kidnapped shouldn't you have to help the violinist because you're not related to the child and you're not related to the violinist and so then it comes down to our basic or ordinary needs versus extraordinary needs in the case of the violinist needing to be plugged into my body ([TimeÂ 0:41:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81b12776a6b0009c7342b))
- > imagine that you are a parent and you have a born child and you love your child your child suddenly gets very sick 44:30because your child has kidney disease yep and is going to die unless your child gets a kidney transplant now he said imagine that you were the only person in the world with the right body type so as to be able to donate one of your kidneys in doing so save your child's life no one else has the capacity to be able to do this he said would it be nice of you the parent to give your kidney one of your kidneys to your child yes it would be nice would it save your child's life yes he said it 45:00would would it kill you know you've got to but then he said should the law force a pyramid to give their kidney to their child question yeah and he said no and even from a cow the perspective we know when it comes to organ donation that there isn't a moral obligation to donate ones organs it can be an act of generosity and the right circumstances but no moral duty and so he said just as a parent should not have a legal duty to give their born child their kidney a 45:30parent in the case of the mother should not have a legal duty to give her preborn child her uterus ([TimeÂ 0:44:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81b5335745d0009a46310))
- > the question we have to ask ourselves is this what is the nature and purpose of the kidney versus the nature and purpose of the uterus because when we ask and answer that question we come to see why a parent should not be legally obligated to give one but actually should be legally obligated to give the other and so I said the kidney exists in my body for my body I said the uterus is very different well in Jesus I said the 47:30uterus exists in my body every single month getting ready for someone else's body every single month my uterine lining is thickening in great expectation for the implantation of the next generation and I said therefore you could say the uterus is unique from all the other body parts in that it exists more for my offspring then for me and they can therefore claim a right to that in a way 48:00the preborn are born couldn't claim a right to I get your kidney I get this I get that ([TimeÂ 0:47:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81b8a548ef00009796980))
- > not only is this there a parental responsibility you're the parent this is your child there is a parental responsibility to meet the basic needs of one's offspring and so it's for a child to be taken to Disneyland but there's no 49:00it if that's an extraordinary thing it's not an ordinary thing but food clothing shelter that's ordinary care yes and so in the case of pregnancy maintaining a pregnancy allowing the uterus to be used for the very nature of the uterus exists for is the food clothing and shelter so to speak for the preborn child that's needed at that stage of one's offspring what offsprings life in the way born child's who is an offspring Orca needs 49:30that um and then so so I would argue that because the parent-child relationship because the nature of the uterus because it's basic care you have to care for the child when it comes to the violinist that's above and beyond the call of duty here's a course extraordinary versus the child in the cabin that's feeding a child who's not related to you is ordinary care and then the added element is if you're the parent even more ([TimeÂ 0:48:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81bd4ebdd6f000afe490b))
- > what distinguishes women in general yes from mothers specifically they have they have offspring that they have offspring so therefore we know now to be a mother involves the presence of 54:00another and it involves a very special relationship one of nurture and care for the more vulnerable party so starting with that then I would say okay in this scenario you've described this is cause for concern we ought to respond the question is how hot we respond and in terms of figuring out our how the beginning place has to be two lives are involved the mother and the child yes and we have two valuable with lives 54:30equally we recognize both our unrepeatable and irreplaceable both are willed and loved in the eyes of God and the mother isn't more important the child then the child the child is not more important than the mother they're both equal but we recognize because one party is more vulnerable the younger preborn child that that child is actually dependent on the mother equal to but dependent on the mother so if we want to preserve the child's life for a good portion of the pregnancy we actually need to preserve the mother's 55:00life so that would be the general information I would propose at the beginning and then I would say in order to determine how we ought to respond we can acknowledge that there are some paths we could take that are immoral and although those aren't open to us it doesn't mean that there aren't other paths we could take that would be moral so for example imagine you're driving home and there's a big orange sign up that says road closed detour ahead ok and then you follow these arrows that take you all around a neighborhood you 55:30normally don't go through to ultimately get home do you still get home yes yes but not the way you normally take that option wasn't open to you you still reached your final destination but you went around or a longer path so in the same way I would say when the woman's life is in danger we want to reach that and goal of saving her life but road close detour ahead the one path that is not open to us is the path that would involve directly and intentionally coding the child's life because it's wrong to directly and intentionally end 56:00the life of an innocent ([TimeÂ 0:53:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81c82548ef00009796981))
- > when people say they don't know when life begins I then ask question back and say out of curiosity when do you ban abortion and wherever they ban abortion I would say well isn't that when you think life begins so if they ban abortion it's six months pregnancy or at birth then they must be acknowledging life begins there otherwise they wouldn't ban abortion there so then you make that point to show them you're claiming you don't know when life begins but you are asserting you do yours you just because you just drew a line but then here's the question on what basis do you have for life beginning at six months or life beginning at birth even if you look at the number six months mmm that label for us to get there six months implies that we think something significant happened six months ago that causes to count passage of time that caused us to look at the clock ticking oh we got to six months well if we got to six months if fertilization is what happened six months ago isn't that when life begins if fertilization happened three months ago instead of drawing the line at three months wouldn't it be three months ago that life begins at the moment of sperm egg fusion if someone were to say well I don't know when to ban abortion because I truly don't know when life begins then I would say two things one I would give them the science for life beginning at fertilization but two I would say if we don't know when you don't know accept the science shouldn't we err on the side of caution you know if you're going to blow up an old building you've got your dynamite all around you're about to do an implosion but someone says you know what I don't know if everyone's out of the building there could be someone still inside here do you just say but let's blow it up anyways you know or do you err on the side of caution and say we're not gonna blow this building up until we're sure so to say I don't know when life begins is different than saying there is no life here yeah and if someone cannot declaratively say there is no life here but instead they're like I just don't know then they actually might need to err on the side of caution and say well if we don't know if there's a chance then we need to to err on that side ([TimeÂ 1:12:35](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81ebc35745d0009a46312))
- > this is a scientific paper written by a physician and scientific researcher dr. Maureen Kondik who wrote a paper called when does human life begin and in that paper she makes an amazing case for life beginning at fertilization and for life beginning at the beginning of fertilization because the beginning of the begin at the beginning of the beginning because if if you know anything about science and this is where again you don't know who you're talking to you could be speaking to a med student who will say to you well fertilization is a process that takes 20 24 48 hours or whatever the case may be so it what what hour does life begin so doctor conduct makes the point that it literally begins at the beginning of that let's say 24-hour period and and she makes the case this way she says when scientists have a bunch of cells and they want to know are these cells all the same type or are they different she said scientist two criteria they look at cell composition and cell behavior so in other words what does it meet up of what does it do and so she said when you look at a sperm cell what's its composition the genetic material of the father when you look at an egg what's its composition the genetic material of the mother so already with sperm and egg we know they're different cells because of composition she said now let's look at behavior when a sperm is in existence and alive it swims to find an egg and fertilize it that's the behavior of a sperm seek out an egg and penetrate it an egg what is the behavior of an egg it's to sit around and allow for penetration to occur so by behavior we can see the sperm cell in the egg cell are different from each other by composition they're different from each other therefore different cells so here's how that's relevant let's look at that criteria in light of the one celled embryo or zygote is that embryo or zygote same same thing as I go does the the one celled embryo is that individual that cell different from the sperm and the egg by composition behavior yes here's how we know when you have the embryo even before the chromosomes have intermingled because that takes time and so at the moment of sperm egg fusion when you have the sperms head which has gone into the egg you now in that entity have the composition of the mother and the father the genetic material of both the chromosomes haven't intermingled but they're all contained in that one cell so by composition we know we're dealing with something different then let's look at behavior if you look at one embryo the moment a sperm has penetrated an egg and you have the embryo if another sperm comes along what happens is it allowed to penetrate I don't know I guess not it can't if it doesn't because this zone is created around the embryo that prevents penetration from happening now if that was the egg cell it would allow penetration if it was a sperm it would be swimming around so by virtue of looking at composition and behavior of the embryo we see it's different from the sperm cell or the egg cell so my point we know that something substantively new has come into existence that we didn't have prior to sperm egg fusion and that new thing is the offspring the next generation of the parents and therefore if we believe parents have responsibility to their children since we have a new child genetically distinct from mum and dad then we ought to protect that child from that point forward ([TimeÂ 1:14:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81f2bebdd6f000afe490d))
- > two reasons one we might feel more affection just natural affection for the child that we've perhaps even held or comforted or played with but two there's a part of it is an analysis of success you know almost like a triage situation where it's like if I grab this child and I get the child out of the building I've not only saved this child in this instant but this child is gonna keep living so I have the likelihood of success in removing this child from the building I don't have that likelihood of success when I run out of the building with with 20 frozen embryos because first of all I don't want them to thaw or they're gonna die but if I'm taking the the canister out of the building does it need to be plugged into something so are they gonna die in the process of removing even if I can somehow use a generator - or whatever is needed to you know keep them in their frozen state when they're out of the building then what do I have a likely to success I'm will they be implanted should they be implanted that's a whole other ethical dilemma is is is it ethical to implant embryos in in other human beings who are not they're their biological parents and so part of it could be beyond the emotional connection is likelihood of success of actually saving lives so once you start to break down the scenario you realize this isn't a case for abortion yeah I can't saw the embryos grab their born child and run out I kill you and I save you no it's I want to say both parties the 20 and the one if I can I will but inability to save is not the same as direct killing and it's certainly not saying that if I don't save you that you're not equal to the one I saved ([TimeÂ 1:22:29](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81fec548ef00009796983))
