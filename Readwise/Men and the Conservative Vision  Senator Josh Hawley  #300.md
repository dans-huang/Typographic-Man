- > we could give the devil is due and we could say every institutional structure ever generated by human beings has a corrupt element and it's corrupted by let's say the desire for narcissistic 09:00power on behalf of the people who occupy the structure and since time immemorial it's been necessary for human beings to keep an eye on their institutions so they don't become entirely corrupt but to point out that a that institutions contend towards corruption let's say as a consequence of the inappropriate expression of power is a very different thing than to say that the institutions themselves are built on something approximating exploitation ([TimeÂ 0:08:46](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b07884ede0e00085303f8))
- > if you look carefully at the manner in which opposition to slavery made itself 15:00manifest it appears to me that it's part and parcel of a much older biblical than British tradition and that is the flowering of this idea this strange idea that despite surface appearances that might be differences in wealth and Status the difference between the aristocracy even and the commoners human beings have an intrinsic dignity that's not to be um that's not to be trifled with certainly not economically and that's the spirit 15:30that manifested the rise of of democracy in Great Britain and also the spirit that animated the the formation of the US ([TimeÂ 0:14:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b07ec89fe9600082e6499))
- > I think the left sees any sort of Authority higher than their own desires and their own will as fundamentally oppressive so as soon as you mention the word god that becomes a source of Oppression oh wait a minute there's there's there's some higher standard than what I want to do with my life there's some higher standard than my whims or passions no no no no no no I'm that's oppressive I'm I'm being oppressed and so they almost 20:00see the individual as as a self-sustaining self-generating self-originating entity the problem with that is that if if that's true then on what basis are you going to claim that all individuals have equal dignity that no one individual should oppress another and that we should we should we should work together in a form of self-government and common Liberty I mean it gets to the problem that you've been talking about but I I think it's the idea really of God if we're coming right down to it ([TimeÂ 0:19:33](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0845ebd0480008917f3b))
- > we know that thoughts that are associated with 21:00self-consciousness are statistically indistinguishable from experiences of negative emotion so it's literally the case that the more you think about yourself the more unhappy you are unhappy anxious grief-strick and frustrated disappointment disappointed hurt and so then you think well where did people find the meaning that helps them abide through tragedy and turn their 21:30attention away from themselves and the answer is well we don't even have to introduce God into the picture at the moment you say well you find a fair bit of that sustaining meaning through reciprocal relationships you want to have an intimate relationship of some duration or it's just a series of short-term psychopathically narcissistic pit stops which don't seem to do anyone any good so you want to have an intimate relationship of some duration you probably want to have a 22:00family at least to have some contact with your parents and your siblings and perhaps even children if you dare to do that likely you need some friends you probably need something approximating a job or a career you have to be nested inside a series of superordinate social structures in order to be a functioning individual at all and so I think conservatives can to offer a rejoinder to the Liberals and say you you are assuming that individual autonomy is a higher good only because 22:30for centuries the individual was so ensconced and superordinate social Community by default that you could just ignore that that existed and now we can't do that anymore because people are so fractionated that they're abandoning well marriage they're abandoning family they're abandoning friendship I suppose in favor of its virtual alternative and that's catastrophic and I think young people know this ([TimeÂ 0:20:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0885ccecc10008e0aa5f))
- > you find meaning in life not So Much by what you gain but by what you give up it's not so much by what you accrue to yourself but it's what you give away to other people it's who it's who you choose to serve what you choose to spend your life on and I think what modern liberalism tells people is demand your rights demand entitlements demand the Fulfillment of your desires what 23:30conservatives should be saying is go and find somebody to serve go and find something greater than yourself to be part of go and give your life to something and as you do you'll find that you are able to to make the world around you a better place and you don't do that by by again accruing things to yourself you don't do that by by piling up more rights you do that by giving yourself away in a sense which is I think a very fundamental truth that every husband knows every father knows and I think that that's something that that young 24:00people want to hear they want to be called to something greater than themselves and liberalism just doesn't offer that liberalism is is at the end of the day it's a cult of satisfying your own desire whatever it may be today and at least people fundamentally alone adrift and isolated ([TimeÂ 0:23:08](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b08a54ede0e00085303fc))
- > if you treat yourself properly which might be part of a more mature liberal ethos let's say then you're not a prisoner of each momentary whim and the reason for that is that all that happens if you are that is that you betray yourself and so we know for example that Psychopaths who are motivated by power and very manipulative and who are in it for the gratification of their own whims do very badly across any reasonable length of time they're 25:00completely incapable of learning from experience technically and what that means is they constantly betray themselves and so if you're pursuing an Impulse of Hedonism then to hell with you tomorrow fundamentally and next week and next year you continue to do things that are pleasurable or Escapist in the moment but all it does is drive you downhill across time because you should treat yourself as a community that extends across time ([TimeÂ 0:24:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b08c94ede0e00085303fd))
- > if you do want the best for yourself in some higher sense let's say yourself across time it's clearly the case that the most effective way to achieve that is to be unbelievably useful and generous to other people because there are a lot of other people and so if you're interacting with them in a manner 26:00that is let's say self-sacrificing in a reciprocal Manner and generous then they're going to want to interact with you and so if you interact with a thousand people in your life and you're generous to all them and they reciprocate then you're the beneficiary of a thousand acts of generosity a thousand continual sets of Acts of generosity how can that not be a better approach than trying to maximize your momentary whim ([TimeÂ 0:25:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b08ef43915b0008027b7b))
- > as the left's 29:30program has has come to take root as they've attacked these cultural institutions like the family like the church uh like even the local neighborhood as they have as they have attacked the very idea of finding your life in sacrifice and service to others what are we left with we're left with whoever has the most options and the most power is the most free what are we left with we're left with a new hierarchy in the United States which is if you have an advanced degree and can 30:00earn a lot of money then you are the best and you have the most choices in life and you are the most valuable member of society if if you're not if if you are not somebody who who wants to go get a four-year college degree if you don't earn a lot of money then you're somehow less than you're lesser so what we end up with is a a hierarchy of elitism a hierarchy of educational attainment a hierarchy of status ([TimeÂ 0:29:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b09644ede0e00085303fe))
- > as people abandoned their subsidiary social 31:00organizations so you abandon your long-term marital commitment you abandoned your decision to have children you abandoned your willingness to engage in reciprocal friendships you don't shoulder your civic duty you isolate yourself in your job in your career all of that responsibility that you undertake is then vacuumed up by people who will use it for the purposes of their own power ([TimeÂ 0:30:57](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b099989fe9600082e649a))
- > if you don't take on the responsibility that's commensurate with a properly integrated life then tyrants will take all that responsibility from you and use it to in the name of the maintenance of oppressive power ([TimeÂ 0:32:01](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b09ae89fe9600082e649b))
- > everywhere around the the industrialized world the the so-called developed world and every country in which the left party has emphasized cultural and social 40:30change cultural and social uh critique much as the left in America has in fact and everywhere where they've elevated this idea that the foundations of Western Society are fundamentally oppressive and illegitimate in every single instance the working people of the country have moved towards the right why is that because the working people of the country don't believe that the working people of the country want to preserve 41:00their culture and their Liberties they don't want it taken from them in reform ([TimeÂ 0:40:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0ad6ebd0480008917f3c))
- > the thing is rights are always obtained at the expense of someone else in some sense if you only concentrate on rights because every person's rights is the 43:00collective's responsibility let's say or each individual's responsibility and the other issue that you brought up is something like the Dignity of work and service and if it's all about your rights and not about your responsibility and the meaning in your life is actually attendant on the responsibility then all that clamoring for rights just makes you makes your life devoid of any purposeful meaning and that strikes me as highly probable given that most purpose is equivalent in some sense to self-sacrifice 43:30to have a purpose is to go do something right not just to sit around and wait in some sense for some kind of instantaneous trivial gratification but to strive forward for something worth attaining and and that is that is always in the domain of responsibility ([TimeÂ 0:42:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0b1bccecc10008e0aa62))
- > it depends on whether or not you think that people are victims or citizens and if they're victims then they have to have their their oppression remediated and it would require a central authority to manage that and of course that should be the alarm Bell right there it's well why in the world are you going to trust a centralizing Authority when you have 46:00every reason not to and alternatively you could say well life is difficult there's no doubt about that and some people are dealt worse hands than others in some ways but that doesn't mean that you can't put your best foot forward in service and find the meaning in your life in pushing back against that which enshackles you let's say and that strikes me as highly probable and psychologically appropriate ([TimeÂ 0:45:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0b66abba0b00083cc3cc))
- > what the Garden of Eden really is in many ways is it is a temple and what it's a temple where God dwells and Adam is there and Eve too cooperating working with God that's the symbolism of it what is supposed to happen Adam is supposed to work with God to make the rest of the world a temple 50:00to to expand the garden if you like to make the world beautiful to make the world what it could be to bring the world into further into Perfection and to work with God to do that now that I would suggest to you that's a pretty high calling that suggests that wow a man can really make a difference in life that a man has a has a high calling in life that's a vision you could give yourself to and sacrifice for ([TimeÂ 0:49:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0bababba0b00083cc3cd))
- > to the degree that each person is unique and their each person is unique to a great degree then each person has something to bring into the world that only they could bring into it and that's literally the case and I do believe that that's part parcel of the idea that human beings are made in the image of God is God is presented in the biblical Corpus as the fundamental creative force of of reality itself and that's echoed 54:30inside of us and so if we don't bring forth what is within us then there's a lack in the structure of reality and that lock produces undue pain and misery and suffering and so it is the case that each person needs to shoulder the responsibility for improving the garden you might say as you pointed out earlier or working towards the perfect ability of existence itself and that's a heavy load for each person to bear too because 55:00it turns out that it isn't true that nothing you do matters what's true is that everything you do matters a lot more than you think and you should get the hell out of it now because uh or or else in some sense you know the other thing we know as a consequence of having blundered our way through the entire 20th century is that when people do abdicate their responsibility on Moss which is what you saw in well Nazi Germany what you saw in totalitarian Soviet Union and in Mao's China that things turn into hell very very rapidly ([TimeÂ 0:54:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0c1aa1740a000870af7d))
- > our world is so ordered that even Small Things even small acts of faithfulness small acts of sacrifice small acts of constructive work have huge effects over time in our own lives and the lives of people around so it's not as if you don't have to go cure cancer in order to make a difference ([TimeÂ 0:56:15](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0c43a1740a000870af7e))
- > the 57:30smallness of right action is only a consequence of a kind of of an inappropriate perspective that assumes that the local and daily is minimally important when there's no evidence for that at all ([TimeÂ 0:57:29](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0c6cabba0b00083cc3cf))
- > you're manifesting your true social responsibility through your intense engagement with the local and that might mean you're a dishwasher so you get the hell out of bed and you show up to work 15 minutes early so the restaurant can run properly and that's not trivial it and if you think it's trivial it's because there's something wrong with your attitude not because it's trivial in and of itself ([TimeÂ 0:58:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/637b06c83616e10008bb0a34?annotationId=637b0ca0ccecc10008e0aa64))
