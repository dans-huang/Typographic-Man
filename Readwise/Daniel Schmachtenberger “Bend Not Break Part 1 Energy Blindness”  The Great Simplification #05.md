- > the work of cultural anthropologist marvin harris called cultural materialism he frames all historical human cultures have something in common they have a superstructure which is the uh ideologies the beliefs the memes the stories that the culture tells in the middle is the structure which is the institutions and the rules and the laws and the economic system but underpinning it all is the infrastructure which is the energy and 08:30the throughput and the waste streams and how the system functions and so you and i both agree that what's coming in the coming decades is we're going to have to solve all three of those we're going to have to move them together ([TimeÂ 0:08:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b091bfef20a70009100132?annotationId=62b1bdc968a3bb0009c259fa))

- > so energy is fundamental to nature energy is the currency of life in natural systems organisms and ecosystems that self-organize around any energy capture have an evolutionary advantage if you don't have surplus energy as an animal you can't reproduce and and have uh misses and have uh um 11:00homeostasis and everything so the ratio of energy return to the energy invested as caloric pursuit in nature the huge driver and that also applies to human systems ([TimeÂ 0:10:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e4e3a5d5070009ec3f06))
- > since the 1800s or so we have been drawing down this energy battery which is the stored carbon and hydrocarbons in the form of oil coal and natural gas 10 million times faster than it was 13:00sequestered uh by the daily trickle charge of photosynthesis in the deep past of earth and our economic system is treating this as if it were interest when it actually is our principle ([TimeÂ 0:12:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e50ec83dd6000937f7e2))
- > gdp is cannot decouple from energy because it's a measure 15:00of uh how much stuff we burn it's goods and services and there's energy that is required to refine uh deliver maintain run and dispose of every product on earth ([TimeÂ 0:14:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e5428f5340000922693a))
- > we as uh individuals as families as small 15:30businesses as corporations as as nation states we are trying to maximize financial surplus money profits which are tethered to energy which are tethered to hydrocarbons and we can't stop or slow down because the system requires growth to continue and to pay off the financial claims from the past and so what we're doing is we're kicking the can with various rule changes uh with debt etc 16:00and we have to continue to grow but the growth is tethered to energy and the only way that we're continuing this right now is by central banks and governments blowing up their balance sheets in order to keep goods and services flowing to large populations so what has happened is the market or the downward causation of a higher level system than than human individuals um is imposing 16:30rules on our behavior that are out of our control and so we are de facto the human species right now is functioning as an energy hungry super organism ([TimeÂ 0:15:25](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e5718f5340000922693b))
- > one of the deepest definitions of life is actually an entropy pump something that can take more energy from the environment and externalize its entropy 18:00and so then you're looking at the way that human technology starting with stone tools and then agricultural tech and then industrial tech allowed us to harvest more energy from our environment than other animals to be able to do future surplus stuff and then to be able to compete with others over the future surplus and grow populations faster and how how fundamental of a kind of defining characteristic this thermodynamic combined with competitive or like it's a thermodynamic and then evolutionary theory together 18:30where the tech ends up evolving our capacity to extract energy and use energy for more stuff which increases our kind of ability to win at wars and economic wars and whatever else driving an arms race of the ability to extract external eyes etc faster driving ultimately fragility of the planet at large ([TimeÂ 0:17:51](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e5e8c83dd6000937f7e3))
- > in nature those those um ecosystems that are able to capture more energy have an advantage and it it ends up resulting in a scaling law called klieber's law which is that animals energy use scales to the three-quarter power of their size and this works for mice all the way up to blue whales and so the size of the organism show dictates how much energy it uses 20:00well lo and behold if you aggregate all the countries in the earth the the slope of global gdp is right around the the size of the gdp to the two-thirds power it's not exactly the same but the relationship holds even as a biological organism the whole human economy ([TimeÂ 0:19:32](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e62917834a0009f93830))
- > current sunlight which is crops old sunlight which is trees maybe you'll chop down a 100 year tree and then ancient sunlight which is tens to hundreds of millions of years 21:30ago and you're right you can use technology to ex to access those pools of of potential energy ([TimeÂ 0:21:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e64f8f5340000922693e))
- > that grains were more storable than say what you could hunt and gather meats and berries and stuff more storable means you can make it through the famine and grow the population faster and then if you grow the population faster you can win a 22:00tribal warfare and now you also have more stuff that is worth invading for another tribe so now you have to do defense and military and all the things that go along with having that surplus and now for the first time the economics of needing to deal with surplus come about so private property ownership and inheritance and all those things it was like it was a big deal that particular um transition was when that was when our species ate the apple in the garden of eden ([TimeÂ 0:21:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e689b985270009454705))
- > that was also kind of in one 22:30way the beginning of the anthropocene because before that you want nature to be pretty much the way it is to hunt and gather from this the first time you want to start clear cutting an area to turn it into agriculture land for lots of grain because in a gather environment there's not enough grain to be useful you've got to row crop it to then be able to drag a plow behind it so you can kind of consider the beginning of the anthropocene and the beginning of extraction of stored energy corresponding together ([TimeÂ 0:22:29](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e6f317834a0009f93832))
- > what also happened um is that's when inequality really started to occur we were always in equal in terms of status and uh respect and things like that but we were always incredibly equal in terms of consumption because we didn't have anything we didn't have stuff to carry around with us everyone's uh actual consumption of of outside of the body calories was pretty much the same but once we started 23:30soaring surplus that's when the uh the hierarchies um started yeah the beginning of the thing we call civilization that started scaling well beyond the dunbar number which equaled how to domesticate wild-type humans that would have otherwise been dunbar tribal ([TimeÂ 0:23:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e7209926c10009a27dbe))
- > exosomatic energy is energy that we consume but not by eating it's outside of the body so inside the body the average american consumes like 2500 calories outside the body the average american consumes over 200 000 kilocalories per day 25:00um in the lights and the airplanes and the shopping centers and the libraries and the buses etc so we're the only species that massively uses energy outside of the body and that is only made available by the fact that we're accessing this pool of stored hydrocarbons ([TimeÂ 0:24:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e7688f534000092270a6))
- > sixty percent of the nitrogen in our bodies today has a chemical signature coming from natural gas so we've massively boosted the food supply directly from fossil carbon and hydrocarbons ([TimeÂ 0:31:07](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e8d4b8643700098bc2ea))
- > some countries have decoupled their economic output from their energy use there's something called the energy intensity of gdp which is how much energy we need to generate a dollar of gdp the united states the united kingdom are service-based economies 36:00so we actually have gotten much more efficient generating gdp by using less energy but the the important thing from the super organism vantage point which is our future sustainability our ecosphere our climate our oceans is what the whole human system does and the whole human system is is extremely tightly tethered over 99 percent because the united states and the united kingdom 36:30um in in america the average american consumes 57 barrels of oil worth of fossil fuels per but we import another 17 or so from china in we don't import the oil from china we import the televisions and the plastic salad bowls and and things like that the energy was burned in china we paid dollars for it and it comes here so it's our it's part of our consumptive 37:00footprint but the bottom line is that um globally energy and gdp are tightly linked one other caveat i would say there the last five to eight years it seems to be globally a little bit more decoupling and this is an artifact of this massive uh off in the financial markets due to central banks because of the way that pension funds are treated in the gdp calculations and when and if 37:30i would say if or i would say when stock markets recalibrate that relationship will tighten back up around the the 99 plus percent ([TimeÂ 0:35:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e9a58f53400009227daf))
- > this kind of wealthy nation that doesn't do its own manufacturing and production and waste management and largely exports kind of tech services can make it seem 38:30like it has higher gdp relative to its own domestic energy use but it's [Â __Â ] because it's just exporting all of its like really high energy intensive stuff to the manufacturing that's happening somewhere else it then imports the products of and i find this like i find this for so many things you can take a country that has a good genie coefficient but it's just because it exported all the cheap labor to somewhere else that it depends upon to get its stuff so you're like you don't really have a good genie coefficient your economic inequality that's needed to make your civilization 39:00run is still very high because you just buy your [Â __Â ] from cheap labor from somewhere else ([TimeÂ 0:38:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea1d8f53400009227db3))
- > william stavan stanley jevins was a 19th century economist who paradoxically predicted that the massive 41:00beneficial invention of the steam engine which made things way more efficient than horses uh or what came before paradoxically would end up having humans use a lot more energy even though it was more efficient that's because most more people could afford things uh things would be done faster they would build more of these steam engines and that is of course what happened ([TimeÂ 0:40:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea6e8f53400009227db4))
- > first of all technology is deflationary because the market system and innovation and people are incentivized to make better inventions so over time things that are tech heavy like flat screen tvs will get cheaper and cheaper until they asymptotically you just can't get them any cheaper but so tech is deflationary 42:00counter to that is depletion which is that we've accessed the best fossil hydrocarbons that are the main input to our economies and then we have to access the next harder tranche etc eventually there's nothing left but we're not there yet so these two forces between technological deflation and resource input inflation are are battling ([TimeÂ 0:41:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea8fa5d5070009ec4098))
- > there's really two categories of technology the first tech the first 42:30category is ways to make our energy use our energy capture more efficient for example we can develop new solar voltaic cells that are more efficient or we could take a power plant and the amount of energy that we input we get more electricity out of that the second type of technology is inventing uh new ways uh or or ways 43:00that humans use energy that we used to do manually and now we have machines do it or new ways like facebook that we never had before and now it's a new vector for energy use so it's that second category of technology that dominates our our global technology portfolio which ends up building more and more things that are a vector for more energy use next year now jevin's paradox means 43:30that if something gets more efficient the people will buy more of it or the savings that they have from saving money on that thing will be spent at walmart on some things that they bought from china so what ends up happening is efficiency is in service of the super organism to a large extent so efficiency as long as we have gdp as our cultural goal where the market system and individual and and uh corporations and and businesses optimize 44:00profits via gdp efficiency will just feed more money into that system in a positive feedback loop and we'll use more energy in the future ([TimeÂ 0:42:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eac8c83dd60009380ff3))
- > anytime you get an increase in 45:30efficiency you get a whole new uh profitability potentials that weren't there and we end up going into those so the idea that efficiency is a way of being able to become sustainable doesn't work as long as there is an ins either an embedded growth obligation or an incentive around net growth ([TimeÂ 0:45:27](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eb09a5d5070009ec409a))
- > so we're at this place where there's this this pegging between gdp and energy we're getting a diminishing return on our energy source and there's an exponential requirement on capital simply because of interest right we have to have more capital next year than we have the capital this year for the nature of the how we set up the financial system so then there starts to become this larger delta of need to keep having more capital which means need to keep having more energy have less and less easy to access energy 48:00so have to technologically innovate offshore oil drilling and fracking and things but eventually you kind of run out of that and then there's a great reckoning so this is what you call it there's not yet a great reckoning because the intermediate step is you paper over that with central bank guarantees and and bailouts and and things like that but yes eventually there's a great reckoning which i'm referring to as the great simplification and yes eventually by definition we will have to have a post-growth 48:30economy ([TimeÂ 0:47:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eb64a5d5070009ec409b))
- > i think we will eventually shrink when we run out of the ability to paper over these biophysical phenomenon with debt and central bank guarantees and too big to fail and artificially low interest rates and things like that and so this gets to your original premise i think we have to anticipate what might happen and try to have our system bend and not break because break gets into many of the categories of the x-risk that you're so fluent in bend means it gives humans another pathway forward towards a saner longer lasting more meaningful culture and one of the ways we could do that is get the prices right on the main input to our economies if we were able to not only carbon but all non-renewable inputs have a tax on anything that's non-renewable on human time scale so that would be natural gas or copper or fossil water aquifers or sand or anything like that um and then simultaneously remove tax on humans 95 of our taxes right now are on human labor so if we removed all those you make 50 000 a year you keep your 50 000 you don't have to pay any taxes but if you bought an iphone which has all kinds of uh complicated expensive machinery uh metals and and minerals in there it might cost two or three thousand dollars relative to five hundred dollars today so if we had the prices right we would be better able to innovate in a way that is um aligned with our future and we would probably conserve we wouldn't just um fly to the bahamas on a junket or vegas or or just buy [Â __Â ] from amazon every day to give us a little bit more dopamine ([TimeÂ 1:06:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ee208f53400009227db6))
- > what you're basically saying is the market as a whole is being subsidized by nature on a savings account that's about to run out and the entire market for the most part is mostly not profitable in a way that would be sustainable because of the total amount of costs that are being externalized and as soon as we run out of the stored free cheap stuff and stop being able to handle the consequences of the pollution the cost of everything goes up so much that it forces a restructure of the market and what we think is profitable and possible by multiples to orders of magnitude but it currently is and that's the break scenario well the break scenario is that the bend scenario is that we have a smaller economy and we change our cultural objectives away from gdb towards well-being and social capital and community and other things rather than gadgets the break scenario is that this all happens without planning without blueprints and airbags and the global supply chains and or the geopolitical uh kinetic warfare is the response to these sorts of crises ([TimeÂ 1:18:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2f03dc83dd60009380ff7))
