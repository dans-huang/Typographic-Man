(
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1gn6g56ebtv6mzntcrk5m3 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The products and services of the modern digital economy continue to bring technology ever closer to the core of the human experience—and “the digital age” is just getting started. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1gnj12cws5nxfawdhx84zr rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Technologies encode practices and values into the societies that adopt them. This happens in many ways, often unpredictably and unintentionally, as the second- and third-order effects of technologies. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr9f28m7g89924mksrcmy5n8 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>It could be argued that the ecology of technologies surrounding the smartphone—the smartphone technology ecosystem—has resulted in an epoch-making shift in how humans relate to each other and the world around them. It has changed human behavior and psychology more profoundly in just two decades than perhaps any prior technology (religion, cultural movement, or empire) ever did in an equivalent timeframe. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr9f7t2nbpxma6s6315fjewy rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>At this point the psychological and cultural effects of widespread, habitual, and nearly non-stop use of these devices has become apparent. Philosophers and public intellectuals are taking for granted the relevance of theorizing about the high-tech future of the smartphone technology ecosystem as an extension and deepening of the human mind
<a href=https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-3 rel=noopener>[3]</a>. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr9fjda3g2pzmeyzbhwp6nt1 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Technologies always create the potential for new forms of behavior, values, and thought, even when the technology is not explicitly made to do so. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0acpth9xm01j42kdqvvrf rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Instant messaging and “Facetime” have come to replace in-person contact as the default modalities of communication. Easy access to nearly unlimited information also inevitably changes the value we place on skills such as memorization, information recall, and the ability to study and learn from books. A GPS device on your phone is designed to get you where you need to go, and it does that. It was not designed to weaken your sense of direction and make you dependent upon it to feel safe in urban or rural areas. Yet it also does that. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0ck8msj2dbvg05gev4wb6 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Any new human-made tool has the potential to shape what is considered to be valuable and why. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0dpcyy3g5se3ddvkp5mhv rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>there is a clear correlation between the availability of bathroom scales and increases in cases of anorexia
<a href=https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-5 rel=noopener>[5]</a>. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0jv57sxtm11sfskk70tfg rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The scale increased the salience and visibility of body weight, changing the ways in which it could be valued, thought about, and otherwise related to psychologically. This had unforeseen outcomes. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0kgc2hq0xwwb0re77cwhe rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Technologies are created with both values and material outcomes in mind. When technologies are brought into the world they create a future: material, social, psychological, and cultural. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0m0af4nnwnc69ca5m6bp2 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Even a technology as simple as the plow is created with values in mind, such as ease of labor, speed of work, and a desire for food surpluses that create a feeling of safety. It serves these values by affecting material outcomes, such as preparing fields for agriculture. The plow would also lead to urban fortifications for storing and protecting food surpluses, and thus change the nature of human habitats, warfare, and architecture. The plow favors men as farmers due to the upper body strength needed to use it, which changed ideologies about the respective value of the sexes. The plow led eventually to certain forms of animal domestication, in the long run altering the relationship between humans and the natural world, and thus moving religious beliefs from animistic to theocentric. Normalization of animal-drawn plowing as the basis of agriculture made it difficult for humans to value animals as sacred and as equal or surpassing humans in worth. It is hard to worship the sacred spirit of an animal that must be beaten all day to pull a plow. Dominion over animals in this way justified the spread of a cultural narrative that humanity’s role is to control nature, rather than to be a part of nature, which laid the foundations for a mindset that eventually resulted in the industrial revolution. These and countless other changes to human minds, behaviors, and culture followed from the invention of the plow. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0r36hn10rspn0ckjqar8w rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Technologies co-evolve with value systems—neither determines the other, even though they are intimately related. Whole epochs of civilization, as ways of life and culture, come to be defined by certain sets of technologies and infrastructures. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0rzeejh42c71r79p2nm9m rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Techno-optimists largely maintain that technology is about what works for everyone—universal functionality—rather than what is good for everyone—universal morality. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0ye3ncxxmcanah994zycp rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>The goodness of the technology feels obvious, particularly when the second- and third-order effects that some users may experience only become evident later or in other domains. To many, it appears that the technology itself is not an issue—it is simply up to people to use it responsibly. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc10ky3a7e8fmxhtd7ht05j rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Technologies are created and evolve together to form whole civilizations (see Box 1). It is important not to consider any technology as existing all by itself. Humans have come to live in massive networks of operationally related technologies, which have come to form whole ecologies and infrastructures supporting every aspect of conscious experience. Ultimately, this new human reality constitutes a technological epoch with distinct material characteristics and societal dynamics. (

It is also values altering: technologies change and augment existing value systems. These two dynamics are related but not deterministic. We saw this above with the example of the smartphone and the plow. It is quite common that the values guiding the design of a technology are different from the value system changes that result from its widespread use. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbs6c78tbyf2rdvq1dszqpr rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>A vast array of related technologies eventually become the background suppositions of a society—its most basic infrastructures—constituting a technological epoch, or a fundamentally new kind of human-created habitat. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsahqztb3gfsgr3tp5vkgb rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>This means that humans can adapt to unique and challenging environmental conditions in ways that other animals cannot, while at the same time humans are able to shape and create unique environmental conditions to fit our needs and values. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsesqqca48bepeg6ccbnj4 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>A new technology affects existing practices of human competition and cooperation, and sets new selection pressures that confer advantage to early adopters of the technology. New technologies themselves become uniquely valuable insofar as they confer advantage. Use of the new technology therefore becomes effectively obligatory, as failure to make use of it results in the loss of competitive advantage. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbskeqefrqvjeknwzm4kc9a rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Sometimes, adopting a new technology becomes basically obligatory. Technology creates a need for itself; it makes itself valuable. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsp53rfs2n5qn87ez60j0s rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Our most prominent technologies tend to shape the metaphors we use to explain the world. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsws8ekenrz4zp2n1a0jmg rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Second- and third-order effects on values, culture, power, and personality must be given due consideration. We can no longer limit ourselves to thinking only about the impacts across material economies, finance, and ecology. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsy97ffkze9tffbmb69692 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Technology is intrinsic to our being and becoming as individuals and social systems. The rapid emergence and saturation of digital technologies—largely based upon fast-paced nihilistic design—has resulted in what might be called an <em>accidental planetary computational stack.</em>
<a href=https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-15 rel=noopener>[15]</a> This means that the technological environments we find ourselves in, with their visible and invisible effects on our bodies, minds, cultures, societies, and ecosystems, did not result from design. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbt0mwkbcs0pktxc53xwe67 rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>technologists should hold ethics as the fundamental priority in the design process, with engineering following its lead. (
<a href=https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbt82xyfyv2vr1h8ccqnp5z rel=noopener>View Highlight</a>)</li><li>Finally, we must seek to clarify the fundamentals of human value systems. It is vital that we factor how psychological processes work in conjunction with technology to change human meaning-making and valuing. Preferable futures require a return to considerations of human nature and conditioning, and how the two interact to influence behavior and thus the experience of being human. These human-making dynamics are an unavoidable part of the consequences that flow from all innovations. As we have developed incredible new capacities, our history of naive and now nihilistic design has driven civilization into a massively complicated bottleneck of existential consequence. Existing ecologies of technologies and infrastructures must be judged by their effects on bodies, minds, families, cultures, and the environment. Future technologies must be designed according to methods that take human value and experience seriously enough to be constrained by their limits—such as sanity, dignity, and justice. The dangerous reign of nihilistic design must end if our civilization is not to. (
