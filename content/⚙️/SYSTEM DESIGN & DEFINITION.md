# Projects
- ✍🏼 ==Writings for publication==
	- 🟢==Ready for publication==
	- 🟡==Drafts in development==
	- 🔴==Topic decided, connections are laid out, need further thinking and resources==

# Areas (of Responsibility)
- 🗺️ ==Maps of Content (the emerging organizational structure / paths I find interesting)==
- 📝️ ==Slip box (Main)==
	- 🌲️ ==Evergreen | Permanent notes / developed ideas==
		  1. How does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what I already know?
		  2. How can I combine ideas to generate something new?
		  3. What questions are triggered by these new ideas? 
	- Write these permanent notes as if you are writing for someone else. That is, use full sentences, disclose your sources, make explicit references, and try to be as precise and brief as possible. 
	- Once this step is done, throw away (or delete) the fleeting notes from step one and file the literature notes from step two into your bibliographic slip-box.
	  
	- 🌿️ ==Ferns | Literature notes ==
		  1. Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep
		  2. Keep the overall note as short as possible
		  3. Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim
		  4. Write down the bibliographic details on the source
