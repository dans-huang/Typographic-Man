- all of these risks are unsolvablewithout solving the things the patterns of human behavior that give rise to thembut that the patterns of human behaviorthat give rise to them can be namedandcan beprogressively not perfectly butprogressively better addressed and thatin doing sothere is a possibility tocreate a attractor for the world that isnot catastrophes or dystopiasin which we have theresponsibility andwisdom adequate individually and collectively tosteward the powerof the exponential technologythat we are creating ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyemt70m24sgnaq71m9tcgx))
- the exponential power of exponentialtechmakesvia decentralizationcatastrophes more likely ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyeyp7ewbe6gb9szpg1vs3d))
- to be able to bind those catastrophes it has to bind all of them because anyof the catastrophes are enough to breakthe thing down to bind all of themrequires really centralized power ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyezn3m3y778d7q7ccxn0a6))
- those arethe two attractorsthat civilizationis currently most likely heading in andwe can see how the solutions to eitherone orient to the other one more ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyf22jzw61fh0a8tgyz61vr))
- i would saythat we are seeking a third attractorthat is neither catastrophes ordystopias seems like a pretty fairstarting place for how do we design acivilization that is desirable or at least allows us to continue to advancein the on the meaningful questions whata desirable civilization isum involves being able to avoid the twinattractors of catastrophes and dystopiasand that those two must always be takenin considerationbecause it's very easy for apartial solutionto externalize a problem somewhere else ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyf3hq5skt777n6jexsf4ah))
- we want to be able to holdthe undesirable possibilities that arein relationship to each other at thesame time we want to be able to hold allthe problems at the same time to then beable to say what does a solution looklike it decreases the likelihood for allof those simultaneously ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqyf3ymve90pmbczvyspjpeb))
- some of the reallywell intended activismthat did actually succeed in solvingparticular problemsended up unintentionally causing otherproblems in the process ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr0g9j4j5jdzc7j87k4q8h03))
- in so far as youbelieve market ideology thatgdp going up means more products andservices that improve people's qualityof life goes up it seems like a goodideainsofar as you realize that war makesgdp go up andsick people engaging in morehealth expenses does and addiction makesit go up you realize okay and the gdpcorresponds to environmental andsustainabilitygdp is not an adequate metric ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr0gd7x5ams2hfbzqq8chggg))
- ourapproach to problem solving is actuallyone of the problems one of theunderlying kind of generators is becausewe define the problems in too narrow away ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr0ge1g92b1mbvq890aefwpm))
- when we define a problem in anarrow way then we can create a solution to thatnarrow problem that does benefit thatthing but that interacts with a lot ofother things and ends up causingexternalities or harm in those otherareas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr0ggqrfywdttqbqgced8tt2))
    - Note: Much like how a super intelligent AI, if given a wrong problem and metrics, will solve that problem in a super efficient, unstoppable manner which also conflicts human values.
- when we think about definingproblems in a narrow way in a world thatis actually interconnected and we'reseparating out from thatinterconnectedness a particular partthat we care about want to advance wecan and this is kind of what is uniqueto humans our capacity tounderstand particular parts withabstraction in a way that allows us tobuild tools our our technology creation capacities are one of the obvious thingsthat is unique to uhtosapiensalso allows us toadvancepartsirrespective of and in ways that areharmful to holes that end up creatingthese other issues ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr0gmxwcgfh0x9dkap0nvab2))
    - Note: harmful to wholes
- our way of thinking about problemsis one of the problems and that weactually have to have a much moreholistic way of thinking aboutuh whatis worth advancing what are all of thethings that are driving a particularproblem and what are thepossible things that will come out of aparticular solution that might createother problems to other metrics to otherareas to other agents ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr0gnxr1f1exf6d1dbp0ajhe))
- when we try to do any kind of like longarc of historyumbig picture orienting frameworksuhwe have to be careful with it there areit it's easy to make those over

- human-induced catastrophic risk can be said to have started in world war iiwith the nuclear bombthat before thatwe just didn't have enough technologicalpower todestroy that much that quickly even ifwe wanted to ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr2wza2beh5gzfy2r7n8y062))
- when we think aboutcatastrophic risk is human-induced catastrophic risk is it isinexorably tied to the level oftechnological development because thetechnology is theamongst other things is a lever for howmuch power our choices haveit also ends up influencing the type ofchoices we make which is an importantpoint ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr2wzrk79ya06rbf98y5gbd4))

- it's fair to say that the bombwas the beginning ofthe level of technology wherehuman-induced catastrophic risk wasactually a thingit's important to say that before thatcatastrophic risk at the level ofindividual civilizations was a realthing and not only was it a real thingit was it pretty much happened to everycivilization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr2x2v5dbzdtwah9m6fw0bhe))

- human civilizations have hadlifespans and they've ended and theyhave largely ended fromself-induced causes that either theywerethey would grow in a way that wasunsustainable to the environment andcollapse for those reasonsor they would uhengage in resource conflicts to be ableto have continuous growth that engendered more enmity with others thateventually led to their warmany of themfellfrom rivals that werelesscapable than previous rivals that theyhad defended against because they wentthrough a internal erosion they becameso powerful that then they startedinfighting and having you know thingslikepolarization and lack of coordinationwhere then even smaller rivals couldfight them so there was something likeinstitutional or civilizational decaythat occurred as a result of their success oftentimes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr2x7e3nb3e394knc0h43nqz))

- an entire world system wascreated after world war ii to preventtheuse of the bomb again andi would say that that post-world war iisystem was successful at preventingnuclear exchange in world war iii ofthat kind kinetic world war three uptill now i would say that it alsoadvancedit was responsibleas asolution to a problem that was toonarrowly defined that caused other problems that world system was alsoresponsible for advancing many of thecatastrophic risks we now face and thatthat whole world system is ending ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr2xdcyr58f2p7k42tw6xp5c))
- thenew global monetary system the brettonwoods monetary system and theum kind of reserve currency system andlike thatthat allowed forexponential growth of theuh global economy and the idea therebeing that um resources economics wereone of the main drivers of warhistorically because everybody wantedmore stuff and thatif there isn't
  a larger pie than to get more stuff youhave to take each other's stuff whichcauses war so that the way to preventwar is a continuously growing pie soeverybody can have more stuff withouttaking each other's stuff of coursewhere does that stuff comes from thatmeantunrenewable depletion and pollution ofthe environment which brings us toall the planetary boundaries that we'reyou know about to hit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr2zmk5akrrd4z8y07dhrgra))
    - Note: And since the Bitcoin standard will bring down the current monetary system, stop the inflation/consumerism/debt-driven economic model and replace it with the deflation/saving/innovation-driven model, agencies with catastrophic weapons will again have the incentives to bomb each other.
      However with the possibility of a 'network state' enabled by Web 3.0, the effort to bomb someone will be greatly reduced, because in order to bomb someone to gain advantage, you not only need to own the weapon, know how to send it to the correct destination, and also need to bomb the right person. Web 3.0 and encryption-driven networks will make it impossible to finish that last step: to bomb the right location because in Web 3.0, the important infrastructures are widely distributed and decentralized. There's simply no specific one thing/person to bomb to make it worth it.

- another major aspect of the post-worldwar ii solution was globalizationand having these radicallyinterconnected global supply chains so
