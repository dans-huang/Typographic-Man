- > 我生活中的一個失望是，我假定從政的人對真理感興趣。事實並非如此。他們感興趣的是實現和保持權力。
  one of the disappointments in my life has been the, I made the presumption of people in politics are interested in truth. That's not the case. They're interested in achieving and retaining power ([Time 0:13:32](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0bcfa8384d70009772463))
- > 種族篇，喬治-弗洛伊德之死，喬治-弗洛伊德之夏的騷亂。如果你看一下，我的意思是，我們都是，總是值得提醒我們自己，在那時候的大多數國家，我們在那件事發生之前的幾個月裡被隔離起來，人們真的被隔離起來，被政府告知要隔離。而這對我們造成的影響之一，我相信是它帶走了我們的社會觸角。如果我們遇到人，如果我們遇到陌生人，16:00朋友和一切，我們坐在餐桌旁，站在酒吧裡，你嘗試的東西，你排練的東西，你討論的東西，你開玩笑的東西，如果你刪除所有這些，然後可怕的事情發生，和一群非常專注的人說，表明X是這種情況。然後人們開始思考，也許這就是事實。
  The race chapter, the death of George Floyd, the summer of George Floyd riots. The, if you look at the, I mean, we were all, it's always worth reminding ourselves in, in most countries at that point, we were made to seclude ourselves in the months before that happened, people were literally isolated and told by government to isolate. And one of the things that did to us, I believe is that it took away our societal antenna. If we meet people, if we meet strangers, 16:00friends and everything, we sit around a dinner table, stand a bar, you try things out and you row about things and you discuss things and you josh about things, and much more if you remove all of that and then something terrible happens, and a group of very dedicated people say that shows X is the case. Then people start to think, maybe that is the case. ([Time 0:15:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0bd78b7ae920009521cf8))
- > 所以你面對的是一個完全怪誕的扭曲的現狀，美國和世界各地的人們都被說服了，而這是有後果的因為如果你被告知情況是這樣的，你生活在一個種族主義的社會，那麼你讓白人相信他們從出生就受到了某種污染。你讓年輕的黑人孩子相信，在美國，他們能夠被國家追捕和殺害。你大規模地加劇了所有的種族差異。但是，這已經陷入了這種，不僅僅是我所描述的對白人的戰爭，而是這套大規模的過度主張，關於這下面是什麼，我們一直都是這樣的，你知道？因此，我們開始重寫我們的歷史，以種族正義和社會正義的名義，在美國，你有一個項目，這不是小事，是紐約時報推出的，由非歷史學家的非專家領導，他們對這個國家的基礎提出了完全可以證實的錯誤主張。
  So you're dealing with a completely grotesque distorted picture of the present that people in America and then around the world have been persuaded to fall for, and that has consequences 18:30because if you are told that this is the case and that you live in a society that's racist, then you bring up White people to believe that they are somehow contaminated from birth. You bring up young Black kids to believe that they are able to be hunted down and killed in America by the state. You massively exacerbate all racial differences. But what this has fallen into has been this, not just what I described as war on White people, but this set of massive overreach claims 19:00about what is underneath this, well we've always been like this, you know? And so we have the starting of the rewriting, of our history in the name of racial justice and social justice, in America you have a 1619 project, no small thing it's the New York Times that rolls that out, led by non historian non-specialists who make totally verifiably false claims about the foundations of this country.

- > 因此，我們一直在以試圖完善現在的名義，嵌入關於我們集體過去的完全錯誤的主張。
  So we have been embedding totally false claims about our collective pasts in the names, of trying to refine the present. ([Time 0:20:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0bdcab7ae920009521cfa))
- > 我認為在某種程度上，這是因為政治已經成為一種愛好，它不僅僅是一種愛好，對很多人來說是一種愛好，然後是更多的東西，它承載著非常大的重量。
  I think in a way this is because politics has become a kind of hobby, it's more than a hobby, a hobby and then something more for a lot people, it's carrying an awful lot of weight. ([Time 0:24:51](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0be32b7ae920009521cfb))
- > 現在再次出現的問題之一是賠償問題。順便說一下，英國在結束奴隸貿易時支付了大量的賠償金。事實上，有證據表明，我在書中分析過，英國為廢除奴隸貿易所付出的代價比通過奴隸貿易所獲得的回報要多。
  one of the questions that's now coming up again is reparations. Britain by the way paid significant reparations when the slave trade ended. In fact, there's evidence, I analyze explain it in the book that Britain actually paid 36:30more to abolish the slave trade than ever gained through the slave trade. ([Time 0:36:14](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0bf9870afb80009901b2d))
- > 我想在書中有好幾次，我使用了尼采在 "道德譜系 "中的幾段精彩的引文。他的一個比喻，我舉的是他談到的那些人，在長期閉合的傷口上扒開結痂，然後尖叫著說他們受到了多大的傷害。這是很貼切的。我認為這就是我們正在處理的問題，我們今天正在處理的是那些為他們沒有遭受的事情而索要金錢的人。而且向沒有做錯事的人要錢。
  And I think a number of times in the book, I use a couple of fantastic quotes of, 38:00Nietzsche from on the "Genealogy of Morals." And one of his analogies, which I lift is he talks of people who, pick at long closed wounds and pick off the scabs and then scream about how much they've been hurt. This is horribly pertinent. I think that's what we're dealing with, we're dealing with people today who are demanding money, for things they didn't suffer. And demanding money from people who did no wrong. ([Time 0:37:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c013f86d450009d5cfd2))
- > 新一代人被說服去打開一個傷口，他們沒有受到傷害，並尖叫著說他們遭受了多少傷害。你知道，實際上，這就是為什麼我做這個關於賠償的子章節的原因，因為這裡面有一個深刻的道德問題，就是在這個階段，是那些看起來像過去做了錯事的人，要求那些看起來像可能做了錯事的人付錢。
  this a new generation has been persuaded to open a wound, they didn't suffer from and scream about how much they've suffered. And you know there's actually, this is why I do this sub chapter on reparations is that there's a deep moral question within this, which is at this stage, it's people who look like people to whom wrong things were done in the past, 39:30demanding money from people who look like people who could have done the wrong things. ([Time 0:39:11](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c055e2ae2900096f8400))
- > 你是怎麼做的，我的意思是，這是許多道德問題中的一個，就是我不相信任何活著的人有被原諒的權利，沒有任何活著的人有原諒的權利。他們沒有這個權利，我在書中解釋了為什麼，簡單地說，在馬爾圖姆，你沒有權利為你沒有做過的事情道歉，如果錯誤沒有發生在他們身上，其他人也沒有權利接受道歉。因此，我們在這套被提出的要求中，恐怕必須小心翼翼地駁回，有時是敏感的，有時是不敏感的。但這是行不通的，這種想法必須被擱置，因為我們現在面對的是歷史性的報應，不僅僅是賠償，而是歷史性的報應。
  What do you do by, I mean, this is one of the many moral problems is I don't believe that anyone living has the right to be forgiven and no one living has the right to forgive. 40:00They don't have the right, and I explain why in the book that simply in Maltum you do not have the right to apologize for something you did not do, and nobody else has the right to accept an apology if the wrong was not done to them. So we are in this set of demands that are being made, which I'm afraid must be dismissed carefully, sensitively at times and insensitively at others. 40:30But it's not going to work, and this idea has to be put to bed because we are now dealing with historic retribution, not just reparations, but historic retribution. ([Time 0:39:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c06bf86d450009d5cfd3))
- > 種族主義、殖民主義和奴隸制是西方故事的一部分，因為它們是整個人類歷史上所有社會和今天許多社會故事的一部分，但它們不是西方的歷史。它們是歷史的一部分。他們不是西方的歷史。而這一點在我們這個時代被完全歪曲了。仿佛這些罪孽是定義我們的唯一東西，44:30實際上，定義西方的是這些我們承認是罪孽的東西。現代中國不承認這一點，世界上許多其他國家和社會也不承認這一點。
  racism and colonialism and slavery were part of the story of the West as they have been the part of the story of all societies throughout human history and in many societies today, but they are not the history of the West. They are part of the history. They are not the history of the West. And that has been totally misrepresented in our day. As if these sins were the only thing that defined us, 44:30well actually what defined the West was that these were things we recognized to be sins. Modern China doesn't recognize that, and many other nations and countries and societies around the world, don't recognize that. ([Time 0:44:08](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c0b8e2ae2900096f8401))
- > 對西方的戰爭，是對我們所珍視的所有東西的戰爭。 旨在只留下那些非常激進的政治活動家想要留下的人，作為唯一對我們的社會有解釋的人。
  the war on the West, is a war on all of the things we treasure. designed to leave behind only people who very militant political activists want to leave standing as the only people with an explanation for our society. ([Time 0:50:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c2d3d6ac900009c950b8))
- > 尼采再次寫到這一點，怨恨的問題，怨恨的人的問題是，實際上只有一個真正的答案，你可以對他們停止怨恨，那就是對他們說，你是對的。有一些東西正在破壞你的生活，並且正在毀掉你。這個東西就是你，你就是這個東西。現在，這樣做的問題是，最後的信息是任何人都想聽到的。因此，對於心懷怨恨的人來說，總是有一個內在的理由來停止向內看。
  Nietzsche again, writes about this, the problem with resentment, the problem with resentful people is that there is actually only one true answer you can have to them to stop their resentment, which is to say to them, you are right. There is something which is wrecking your life, and is ruining you. The thing is you, you are the thing. Now, the problem with that is that the last message 54:30anyone wants to hear. And so there will always be an inbuilt reason for resentful people to stop ever looking inwards. ([Time 0:54:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c38ed6ac900009c950b9))
- > 真正的怨恨的唯一對策是感恩，就是把你對生活的態度扭轉過來，並被鼓勵這樣做，現在這完全是可能的，但是，而其中一點就是要意識到怨恨的生活實際上是什麼樣子。陀思妥耶夫斯基，"卡拉馬佐夫兄弟"。有一個奇妙的段落，魔鬼出現並對其中一個兄弟說，這個兄弟他對其中一個兄弟說，感謝他不能做的事情。當我第一次讀到這段話的時候，我覺得這很神奇。
  The only counter to real resentment is gratitude is to turn your attitude towards life around and being encouraged to do so, now this is perfectly possible but, 55:30and one of the things is to realize what a life of resentment actually looks like. Dostoevsky, "The brothers Karamazov." Has a fantastic passage where the devil appears and says to one of the brothers, the one the brother he says to one of the brothers that gratitude something he can't do. And when I read that first, I thought that is amazing. ([Time 0:55:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c3bfd6ac900009c950ba))
- > 在他的文明系列的結尾，克拉克勛爵令人難忘地說過，禮節是定義西方的東西之一，它是一個非常有趣的東西，在這件事的結尾，但禮節是西方社會的一個巨大的重要的東西，但它不是無止境的。
  in the end of his series on civilization, Lord Clark memorably said that courtesy was one of the things that defined the West, its a very interesting thing to fall on at the end of this thing, but courtesy is a hugely important thing in Western society, but it's not endless. ([Time 1:04:10](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e0b3250cc43200098e860e?annotationId=62e0c47c8384d70009772465))
- > 因此，不禮貌的事情是我們說我們已經禮貌了很長一段時間，我們要停止，因為它似乎對我們沒有什麼好處。因此，我們將追求真理，無論我們想在哪裡追求它，無論我們有什麼手段，無論我們有什麼紀律。我們將停止假裝與西方所有偉大的哲學一樣，美國本土哲學是平等的。
  So the not courteous thing would be us saying we've been courteous for an awfully long time and we're gonna stop because it seems not to be doing us much good. So we will pursue truth wherever we want to pursue it for whatever means we have and whatever disciplines we have. And we will stop pretending that alongside all the great philosophy of the West native American philosophy is equal.
