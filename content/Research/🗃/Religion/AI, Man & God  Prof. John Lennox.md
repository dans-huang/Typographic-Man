- > trusting The Sciences is fine if it's kept to the things at which science is competent but unfortunately over the past few years there has developed a trust in science that we now call scientism where science is regarded essentially as the only way to truth the only option for a rational thinking person and everything else is fairy stories and all the rest of it and I take a great exception to that because it's plainly false it's false logically because the very statement science is the only way to truth is not a statement of Science and so if it's true it's false so it's logically incoherent to start with ([TimeÂ 0:02:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218289faf610008f5d8d0))
- > people like the late Stephen Hawking for example who wrote in one of his books he he said that philosophy is dead and it seems now as if scientists are holding the torch of truth and that's that's scientism the irony of it is of course that he wrote it in the book where it's all about philosophy of science and it's pretty clear that Hawking brilliant as he was as a mathematical physicist really is a classic Exemplar of what Albert Einstein once said the scientist is a poor philosopher ([TimeÂ 0:03:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=6382188c9faf610008f5d8d1))
- > it's so very easy to see that science meaning the Natural Sciences are limited in that they cannot answer the simple questions of a child where do I come from where am I going to and what is the meaning of life and it seems to me immensely important that we recover that and what metaphor went on to say is we need literature we need philosophy and we need theology as well in my view in order to answer the bigger questions ([TimeÂ 0:04:15](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218a99faf610008f5d8d2))
- > science takes things apart to understand how they work and I suppose to understand what they're made of religion puts them together to see what they mean and I think that encapsulates the danger in which we're standing science has spawned technology we've become addicted to technology particularly the more advanced forms of it like AI in my book like virtual reality the metaverse all this kind of stuff we've come addicted to it but we've lost a sense of real meaning and in particular we've lost our moral con Compass ([TimeÂ 0:05:12](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218c69faf610008f5d8d3))
- > Einstein again to quote him made the point long ago he said you can speak of the ethical foundations of science but you cannot speak of the scientific foundations of ethics science doesn't tell you what you ought to do it will tell you of course if you put strict name in your granny's tea it will give her a very hard time in fact it's killer but I can't tell you whether you ought to do it or not to get your hands on her property and so we're left in a scientistic moral vacuum and therefore I feel very strongly that as a scientist of sorts I need to challenge this ([TimeÂ 0:05:51](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218ee9faf610008f5d8d4))
- > science is marvelous but it's limited to the questions that can handle and let's realize it does not deal with the most important questions of life and they're the question of who am I what can life and does life mean and where do we get a moral compass ([TimeÂ 0:06:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=638218f39faf610008f5d8d5))
- > narrow AI system is a system involving high powered computer a huge database and an algorithm that does some picking and choosing that whose output is something that it normally requires human intelligence to do that is if you look at the output you would say normally that it's taken an intelligent person to do that ([TimeÂ 0:15:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd153e31bf8000a84e0ec?annotationId=63bae95bbb592c0008682340))
- here's the huge dilemma which people tryto solve how much of your privacyare you prepared to sacrifice forsecurity there's a tension between thosetwo things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp926q6sr65jrysydb8197ch))
- the irony is as Ihinted at earlier here we are with our
  smartphones that have got all thesecapacities certainly at the Audio Leveland we're voluntarily wearing them sowe're voluntarily seeding part of ourautonomy and our rights really to tothese machines when we don't really knowwhat has been done with all theinformation so we have a huge problemand someone has said we're sleepwalkinginto all of this so that we're captured
  by it we're imprisoned by itand we wake up too late because thecentral Authority has got so muchcontrolthat we cannot Escape anymore ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92dv98xa48m9rh2nnad4te))

- that idea of humansmerging with technology is again verymuch in science fiction but the factthat some scientists are taking itseriously means in the end that thegeneral public are going to be filledwith these ideas speculative of the onehand but serious scientists espousingthem are the other
  so that we need to be prepared and getpeople thinking about them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92q0a26s7pvwtjhacysxhg))
- Harari sees that 21st century ashaving two major agendas according tohimthe first is toas he puts it to solve the technical
  problem of physical death so that peoplemay live foreverthey can die but they don't have toand he says technical problems areTechnical Solutions and that's where weare with physical deaths that's numberone the second agenda itemis to massively enhance human happinesshumans want to be happy so we've got to
  do that how are we going to do thatre-engineering them from ground upgenetically every other way drugsetc etc all kinds of different waysadding technology implants all kinds ofthingsuntilwe move the humans from the animal stagewhich he believes happen through no planor guidancewe with our Superior brain power we'llturn them into superhumans we'll turn
  them into little godsand of course then comes the massiverange of speculation if we do that willthey eventually take overand so on and so forth so that istranshumanismconnected with artificial intelligenceconnected with the idea of theSuperhuman ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92sw4prdgf98z13ef14q0y))
- solving the problem of physical deathre-engineering humans to become littlegods that has all to do
  with wanting immortalityand as a Christian I have a great dealto say about that because what'shappening I believe in the transhumanistthe desire for that is a parody on whatChristianity actually is all about ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92v4a5mbehhec2jrd4jy27))
- it would be very strange tofind yourself in a world where you gotthirsty and there was no such thing aswater ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92xchm13mp0z2efjfq3419))
- that longing
  for another worldimplies that these are not his words butthey're his sentiments that we wereactually made for another world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92xyjhvnv4ahjz1pa7e4z5))
- Ifeel that the transhuman quest is anexpression of the fact that we'rehardwired with a longing for somethingtranscendent and it's trying to fulfillit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92yegzknrahmpv3qsmmm0z))
- there's such confusion in the worldabout what faith is and that's mainlythe fault and I would say the fault ofpeople like Dawkins and Hitchens whoactually didn't know what they weretalking about becausethey redefined Faith actually as areligious word that means believing
  where there's no evidenceand what they fail to see is that's adefinition of blind faith that only afool would get involved with ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp92zqn1ktz4hm86sjxwx86j))
- the word faith from in English from theLatin fee days from which we getFidelity which conveys the whole idea oftrustworthiness and trustworthinesscomes from having a backup in terms ofevidencea bank manager will only have faith inyou if you prove you've got thecollateral you have to bring the
  evidence we'd be foolish to trust peoplewithout evidence so evidence-based faithis something everyone understands butthey don't realize is that it'sessential to science and it's essentialto a genuine Christian faith in God ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9319bhczb0rz2s554h0ew7))
- I could talkabout faith in science without evenmentioning God because scientistshave got a basic Credo things theybelieve they've got to believe that thesigns can be done they've got to believethat the universe is rationallyintelligible that is their faith ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9338y7v1nxm86fkrbbwdv7))
- this is goingto force us whether we like it or not todo some hard thinking and to re-inspectand recalibrate our world viewbecause our attitude to these thingsdepends on our worldview our set ofanswers to the big questions of Life
  what is realitywho am I what's going to happen afterdeath and all those kind of thingsthey're coming out in this area we'rebeing forced to think about themand as you say we can sit like the toadand the kettle when the water is boilingand pretend that nothing's happening butwe can't afford that that isn't a luxurythat's suicidal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9367jhjrfb1264pgmsscre))
- take your two problems one
  physical deathI said no I believe there's powerfulevidence that that was sold 20 centuriesago it was actually solved before thatbut 20 centuries ago there was aresurrection in Jerusalem we celebratedwith Easter we're just after Easternight and as a scientist I believe itfor various reasons that we can discussbut the point is thatif Jesus Christbroke the death barrier that puts
  everything in a different light whybecause it affects you and me how doesit affect you and me because if that isthe case then we need to recalibrate andtake seriously his claim to be Godbecome human I said isn't thatinteresting what are you trying to doyou're trying to turn humans into Godsthe Christian message goes in the exactopposite direction it tells us of a God
  who became human do you notice thedifference and of course that actuallygets people fascinated I say you areactually taking seriously the idea thathumans can turn themselves into Gods bytechnology and so on why won't you takeseriously the idea that there is a Godwho became human is that any moredifficult to do ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp938tn395rb6ecsszv8hvwn))
- once you've got that then I thinkarguably you need to take seriously what
  Jesus says and what he says isand that is the Christian message he isGod become human in order to do whatto give us his lifeif you like to turn us into what youwant to bebecause the amazing thing about this isthat the central message of theChristian faith to you and me is theanswer to the transhumanist dream ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp939q3fve89av5h0djg4v82))
- one
  Christ promiseseternal life that is life that willnever cease and it begins now not insome mystical transhuman uncertainfuture but right now secondly because herose from the dead he promises that wewill one day be raised from the dead tolive with him in another Transcendentrealm that's perhaps even more real
  probably more real is more real thanthis oneand that's going to be the biggestuploading ever ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp93aehxravffd62k0qv0rcm))
- so your hope for the future ofhumanity changing human beings intosomething more desirable living foreverand happier all of that is offered butthe difference between the two isradical because firstly your idea isusing human intelligence to turn humans
  into godsbypassing the problem of moral evilyou're never going to do it no Utopiahas ever been builtand of courseyou're not thinking straight becausethere have been attempts to re-engineerhumanity crude of course the Naziprogram of eugenics the Soviet attemptsto make a new man and what do they leadtorivers of blood 20th century being the
  bloodiest Century in history ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp93bhv5semt8fdxhgbxw6n6))
- I believe even more strongly than ever that we've got as Christians a brilliant answer and a message to speak into this that crosses all the boxesbut it means facing moral reality whichis exactly at the heart of the scarinesswith which some people approach these
  issues ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp93c62x60hbf615p0xdrn8b))
