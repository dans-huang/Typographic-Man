- i don't think there's any differencebetween free speech andand it has to be free because if it's not free it's not thought so imaginemostly you have to think about hard things because why think otherwise if everything's going all right you don't have a problem when you have a problem you have tothink and if you have a problem thethinking is going to be troublesomebecause you're going to think thingsthatupset yourself and upset other peopleit's part of the necessity it's part ofwhat will necessarily happen if you'rethinking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpae40wjm23gsp9xkk4wxydt))

- when you think you have a problem so youask yourself a questionand then answers appear in the theaterof your imagination generally verballyso that'd be like the revelatory elementof thought and that's very much prayer
  like in some fundamental sense becauseit's very mysterious you know the factthat you can pose yourself a questionand then you can generate answers it'slike well why did you have the questionif you can generate the answers if theanswers are just there and where do theanswers come from well you can give amaterialist account to someextraordinarily limited degree butphenomenologically it's still the casethat you pose a question to yourself inspeech and you receive an answer inspeech ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpae78f2wqpgym9sadfqamg9))
- the next
  question is what do you do once youreceive the answer and the answer iswell if you can thinkthen you use internal speech to dissectthe answer which is what you do forexample you encourage your students todo if they're writing an essay you knowthey lay out a proposition and then youhope they can take the proposition apartand essentially if they are what they'redoing is they're transforming themselvesintoavatarsspeaking avatars of two differentviewpoints so you have the speaker forthe proposition and then you have the
  critic and maybe you lay out thedialogue between them and thatconstitutesthe body of the essay and you have to bebloody sophisticated to manage thatbecause it means that you have to divideyourself in some sense into two avatarsthat are oppositional and then you haveto allow yourself to be the battle spacebetween them that and people have to betrained to do that that's whatuniversities are supposed to do it'sreally hard what people generally doinstead of thatis talk to other people
  and that's how they they organizethemselves by talking to other people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpae8kr6xsrs4h85txydf4br))
- you have aright to free speech becausethe entireentirety of society depends
  on this dependsfor its ability to adapt to the changinghorizon of the future on the freethought of the individuals who composeit it's like a free market in some senseit's a free market argument inrelationship to thought we have tocompute this transforming horizon wellhow do we do that well by consciouslyengaging with possibility well how do wedo that well it's mediated throughspeech so societies that are going tofunction
  over any reasonable amount of time haveto leave their citizens aloneto grapple stupidly with complexityso that out ofthat stupid grappling fraught grapplingthat that's offensive and difficult andandand upsettingwe can grope towards the truthcollectively before taking the steps toimplement those truths before they'vebeen tested ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpaea9dvatcxhne3qtwwgby3))
- you have god
  at the beginning of timein whose image men and women women aremade acting as the agent that transformsthe chaos of potential into thehabitable reality that is good and heuses the word the divine word logos todo that and what that implies is thatthe word that's truthful there's more toit than that but the word that istruthful is the word that extractshabitable order out of chaos and that'swhat characterizes human beings that
  capability and i thinkyeahthat's right ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpaec37v4qp5ejc555zwybq8))

  desperate to be treated in that mannerthat it's their primary motivation youwant other people to treat you as if youhave somethingto say that you're worth attending toyou know that you you have theopportunity to express yourself nomatter how badly you do it and ifthey're willing to grant you theirattention and time to help youstraighten that out there isn't anythingyou want more than thatand if you try to structure your socialrelationships on any other basis thenthat intrinsic respect for theirintrinsic value it's going to fail ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpaed0v187d5d1mjqty6mdf1))
- do you believe that there's something
  divinewell let's try to define divine here wecan do that for for a momentmost of us have some sense that literarystories differ in their depththat that i don't think that's anunwarranted proposition some stories areshallow and some stories are deep somestoriesare ephemeral and some move you deeplywhatever that means it's a metaphor butwe understand what it meansimagine there are layers of literarydepthand one way of conceptualizing the
  layers of literary depth is that thedeeper an idea is the more idea otherideas depend on itright and so you have fundamental ideasthat are fundamental because if youshake that idea you shake all the ideasthat are dependent on themand then i would say well the realm ofthe divine is the realm of the mostfundamental ideasand you don't get to believe in that ornot because the alternative is to saywell all ideas are equal in value it'slike okay well try acting thenand you can't because you can't act
  unless you prioritize your beliefs andif you prioritize them you arrange theminto a hierarchy and if you arrange theminto a hierarchy you accept the notionof depthand so that's a no-go ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpaekqc0p9tea3rk879gbzcw))
- when we use language of the divine we'retalking about the deepest ideasand so i believe thatthe notion thateach individualis characterized bya consciousness that transforms thehorizon of the future into the present

- my point is you do have a belief systemwhether you know it or not it's a systemof ethics whether you know it or notthere's either something at the bottomthat unifies it or it's not unifiedwhich means you're aimless and hopelessand depressed and anxious and confusedbecause those are the only other optionsand maybe you don't know what thatunifying belief is
