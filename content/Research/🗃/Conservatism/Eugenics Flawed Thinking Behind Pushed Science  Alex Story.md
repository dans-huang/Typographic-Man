## Highlights
- > everyone thinks their child is special and of course there's millions of children and you don't necessarily think that every child that you encounter on the street is special and then you might say well are you blind about your child or are you blind to every other child and I would say it's the second that's true is that you can actually see your children but you don't have enough mental energy or maybe enough breadth of character to see all other children and so maybe I've thought too that love in some sense is the grace of God you know is that if if you're in a relationship with someone that's characterized by love you see each other in some deep sense and you can't see other people like that because you don't have the ability but it's not like the love is a delusion it's the opposite of it ([TimeÂ 0:38:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=637906512da75b00081c7688))
- > if you're around someone that you love and that love defines the relationship there isn't any better thing you can do and so then to minimize that to call it some sort of biological or biochemical aberration which is the worst form of unconscionable reductionism is to reduce the highest possible goal to something that it's nothing but like a trivial consequence and some underlying materiality it's appalling and it's really demoralizing ([TimeÂ 0:39:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=6379069d2da75b00081c7689))
- > if you think about societies most people and you know most of us here want stability and yet what we keep being sold is change changes absence changes the only consonant you need to go for change change change and the faster the better yeah especially in the face of an emergency well exactly and so so what what does that lead to it leads to a confusion it can only lead to confusion if the one thing that you go for is change ([TimeÂ 0:50:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=637907562da75b00081c768a))
- > a scientific body of opinion never says you ought yeah as soon as someone says that the science says you ought they've made the Gap they've made the leap from is to ought and Science concentrates on is not on ought and so the idea that you can somehow blindly follow the science and also that your moral by doing so is about the most anti-scientific proposition that there could be ([TimeÂ 1:12:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=63790d402da75b00081c768c))
- > Malthus is important because he says too many human beings, Keynes is important because he's the leading member of the British Eugenics Society, then Marx is important because he - just like Keynes and and Malthus - says that people belong in boxes, in other words, they're not humans, they are what we say they are, not what they want what the human being himself thinks he is. and then Darwin writes in particular about race, and there are some very interesting quotes with him and parliamentarians where he explains geopolitical changes including with the Ottoman Empire through the lens of race, and the one of the last sentence of descent his last book is essentially I would rather be a descendant from a monkey than a Savage ([TimeÂ 1:32:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd1513de6ab000931bfca?annotationId=6379101b22aee80008b1b699))
- > the reason why these four people matter, is because they are deeply rooted in our educational framework, whether it's in Canada the US France Germany, these four characters represent biology, economics, politics, and sociology. and so for me that's really important because that framework is essentially where most of our leaders have  grown up intellectually. and so what's important about this, is that we have to escape in my view or we have to try and at least become really aware of what these ideas were, in order for us to be able to extricate ourselves.
