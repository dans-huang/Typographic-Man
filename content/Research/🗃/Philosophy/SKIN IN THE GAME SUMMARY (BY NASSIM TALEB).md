- > 遊戲中的皮膚是關於對稱的。如果你能夠從一個事件的積極結果中獲得好處，那麼如果出了問題，你也必須分擔傷害，並支付懲罰。這種風險不應該是可以轉移給別人的。
  Skin in the game is about symmetry. If you're able to reap the benefits of a positive outcome of an event, you must also share the harm and pay a penalty if something goes wrong. This risk shouldn't be possible to transfer to others. ([Time 0:01:32](https://annotate.tv/watch/62c59f7f2c586700092b6d6d?annotationId=62c5a970631d1700099bb79c))
- > 在遊戲中的皮膚就像最終的BS檢測器。它使我們能夠判斷知識或某些建議的可靠性。這也是關於人類事務中的對稱性。那些不承擔風險的人永遠不應該參與決策。
  Skin in the game is like the ultimate BS-detector. It allows us to judge the reliability of knowledge or certain advice. It's also about symmetry in human affairs. Those that do not take risks should never be involved in making decisions. ([Time 0:02:29](https://annotate.tv/watch/62c59f7f2c586700092b6d6d?annotationId=62c5a9c5631d1700099bb79d))
- > 當有少數人實在無法妥協時，靈活的多數人就會採納少數人的喜好。比如說。一個對花生過敏的人不會登上有花生的飛機。另一方面，一個對花生不過敏的人，可以登上一架裝滿花生的飛機。但他也並不介意登上沒有花生的飛機。簡單地說，最不耐受的人獲勝。
  When there is a minority that really can't compromise, the flexible majority will adopt to the preferences of the minority. For instance: A person who's allergic to peanuts won't board a plane with peanuts on it. A person who isn't allergic to peanuts, on the other hand, can board a plane filled with peanuts. But he doesn't really mind boarding one which is peanut free either. Simply put, the most intolerant wins.

- > 以雇用承包商為例，這相當於租借，而雇用雇員則相當於擁有。當然，在你的企業沒有什麼業務的時候，承包商可能更便宜，但承包商不像雇員那樣可靠。如果雇員不對你這個雇主表現出可靠的態度，他的聲譽和通常唯一的收入來源就會受到影響。顯然，雇員比承包商在遊戲中擁有更多的皮膚。此外，雇員往往比自營職業的承包商更喜歡規避風險的類型。順從的狗，而不是不順從的狼。
  Take for example hiring a contractor, which is the equivalent of renting, versus hiring an employee, which is the equivalent of owning. Sure, the contractor might be cheaper to have at times when your business isn't doing much business, but the contractor is not as reliable as an employee. An employee has his reputation and typically his only stream of income on the line if he doesn't show dependability towards you as the employer. Clearly, an employee has more skin in the game than the contractor. Also, employees are often more of the risk-averse type than self-employed contractors. Submissive dogs, rather than disobedient wolves. ([Time 0:06:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/62c59f7f2c586700092b6d6d?annotationId=62c5ab0a9fb2f70009980574))
- > 不平等與不平等 雖然我以前談過不怨恨富人的重要性，但如果你想有一天自己成為富人，我想問你這個問題。如果可以的話，你會剝奪哪一群人的財富？A組：企業家、音樂家、足球專家。B組：銀行家、官僚、首席執行官（戴領帶的）。你有可能容忍與A組相關的不平等現象，但對B組的富人卻很反感，為什麼？因為B組的富人，似乎是和你一樣的人，只是他們可能玩弄了這個系統，獲得了與他們的地位不相稱的特權。研究表明，美國人更容易怨恨那些靠工資致富的人，而不是那些通過創業致富的人。納西姆-塔勒布認為，人們所反感的，或者至少是他們應該反感的，是那些沒有參與遊戲的高層人士。
  Inequality vs inequality Although I've talked about the importance of not resenting rich people before, if you want to be a rich yourself one day, I want to ask you this question: Which group of people would you strip of their riches if you could? Group A: the entrepreneur, the musician, the football pro. Group B: the banker, the bureaucrat, the chief executive (who wears a tie). Chances are that you tolerate the inequalities associated with Group A, but resent the rich people from Group B. Why? Because the rich people of Group B, appears to be persons just like you, with the exception that they have probably played the system and acquired privileges that aren't warranted for their positions. It has been shown in studies that Americans are more prone to resent people who got rich from salaries rather than those who made it through entrepreneurial endeavors. Nassim Taleb suggests that what people resent, or at least what they should resent, is individuals at the top without skin in the game.

- > 這裡有另一個關於不平等的有趣的觀點--你會說這是一個有很多不平等的國家嗎？嗯，答案是，問題中沒有提供足夠的信息來決定。如果這個國家的預期壽命是100年，如果每個人一生中能在最高的1%中度過一年，而在最低的部分度過99年呢？就不再那麼不平等了，對嗎？考慮到大約10%的美國人將在收入最高的1%的人中至少度過一年，而超過50%的人將在收入最高的10%的人中度過一年。平等不是僅僅通過提高底層人民的水平來創造的，而是通過創造一個富人可以輪換的動態系統。任何付出時間和努力的人都應該得到系統的幫助，達到頂峰，反之也應該如此。任何處於頂層但沒有更多貢獻的人，都應該面臨失去其在前1%的位置的風險。
  Here's another interesting take on inequality - would you say that this is a country with a lot of inequality? Well, the answer is that there isn't enough information provided in the question to decide that. What if the life expectancy in this country is 100 years, and what if every person gets to spend one year per lifetime in the top 1%, and 99 years in the bottom part? Not so unequal anymore, right? Consider that about 10% of Americans will spend at least one year in the top 1% of earners, and that more than 50% will spend one in the top 10%. Equality is not created only by raising the level of people at the bottom, but rather by creating a dynamic system where the rich can rotate. Anyone who puts in the time and effort should be helped by the system to reach the top, and the inverse should also apply. Anyone who's at the top but isn't contributing any more, should face the risk of losing his position in the top 1%.

- > 要使某件事情成為遍歷，就不能有吸收性障礙，這意味著某件事情是不可逆的。
  For something to be ergodic, there can't be an absorbing barrier, which means something that is irreversible. ([Time 0:10:56](https://annotate.tv/watch/62c59f7f2c586700092b6d6d?annotationId=62c5ac5a77e0fa000a456b62))
- > 換句話說，你遇到了一個吸收障礙--你不能再玩這個遊戲了。關於遍歷性出現了混淆，因為看起來，既然 "一次性 "風險是合理的，那麼之後的額外 "一次性 "也是合理的。例如，在輪盤賭桌上，我們很自然地意識到情況並非如此。如果我們一直想把賺來的錢翻倍，最終會破產。在現實生活中，它可能更隱蔽。吃一袋薯片並不是太糟糕，如果你偶爾這樣做，但持續地、每天地、多年地這樣做，將使你面臨遇到吸收障礙的風險--通過你自己死於心血管疾病。
  In other words, you've hit an absorbing barrier - you can't play the game any longer. Confusion arises regarding ergodicity, because it may seem that, since a "one-off" risk is reasonable, an additional "one-off" after that is reasonable too. At the roulette table, for instance, It comes to us naturally that this is not the case. If we keep trying to double the money we've earned, we will eventually go broke. In real life, it can be stealthier. Eating a bag of potato chips isn't too bad, if you do it every once in a while, but doing it consistently, every day, for many years, will make it so that you face the risk of meeting an absorbing barrier - through your own death by cardiovascular disease.

- > 被動投資者的遊戲中的皮膚。當涉及到金融建議時，這是一個很好的起點："不要告訴我你的想法！" "只要告訴我你的投資組合裡有什麼。"
  Skin in the game for the passive investor. When it comes to financial advice, this is a good starting point: "Don't tell me what you think!" "Just tell me what's in your portfolio." ([Time 0:13:57](https://annotate.tv/watch/62c59f7f2c586700092b6d6d?annotationId=62c5acf277e0fa000a456b64))
- > 確保資金經理在遊戲中占有一席之地，即允許他或她從積極的結果中獲得利益，但在消極的結果中也必須付出代價。世界上最偉大的投資者沃倫-巴菲特在組建他的第一個投資夥伴關係 "巴菲特聯營公司 "時就採用了這一點。該協議規定，他將獲得4%以上的收益的一半，但要向他的合夥人支付四分之一的損失。
  Make sure that the money manager has skin in the game in that he or she is allowed to reap the benefits of a positive outcome, but has to pay the price in the case of a negative outcome too. The world's greatest investor, Warren Buffett, applied this when he formed his first investing partnership, "Buffett Associates". The deal was that he would gain half the upside above a 4% gain, but pay a quarter of the downside to his partners.

- > 積極的投資者在遊戲中的皮膚。俗話說 "沒有人洗過租來的車"。如果沒有真正的皮膚，你就不能確定你所擁有的公司的高管是以你的最佳利益行事。因此，每個長期投資者的經驗法則是尋找那些公司的最高管理層也是最大股東的公司。
  Skin in the game for the active investor. It's said that "nobody washes a rental car". Without true skin in the game, you cannot be sure that the executives of a company you own are acting in your best interest. So, a rule of thumb for every long-term investor is to look for companies in which the top management of the firm are also some of the largest shareholders.
