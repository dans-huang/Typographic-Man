- The implicit question is ‚Äì if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: ‚ÄúMoloch‚Äù. It‚Äôs powerful not because it‚Äôs correct ‚Äì nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything ‚Äì but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system *isn‚Äôt* an agent.

- Imagine a capitalist in a cutthroat industry. He employs workers in a sweatshop to sew garments, which he sells at minimal profit. Maybe he would like to pay his workers more, or give them nicer working conditions. But he can‚Äôt, because that would raise the price of his products and he would be outcompeted by his cheaper rivals and go bankrupt. Maybe many of his rivals are nice people who would like to pay their workers more, but unless they have some kind of ironclad guarantee that none of them are going to defect by undercutting their prices they can‚Äôt do it.

- Like the rats, who gradually lose all values except sheer competition, so companies in an economic environment of *sufficiently intense competition* are forced to abandon all values except optimizing-for-profit or else be outcompeted by companies that optimized for profit better and so can sell the same service at a lower price.

- 6. [The Two-Income Trap](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/28/book-review-the-two-income-trap/), as recently discussed on this blog. It theorized that sufficiently intense competition for suburban houses in good school districts meant that people had to throw away lots of other values ‚Äì time at home with their children, financial security ‚Äì to optimize for house-buying-ability or else be consigned to the ghetto.

- From a god‚Äôs-eye-view, if everyone agrees not to take on a second job to help win their competition for nice houses, then everyone will get exactly as nice a house as they did before, but only have to work one job. From within the system, absent a government literally willing to ban second jobs, everyone who doesn‚Äôt get one will be left behind.

Whether or not it was a mistake, it wasn‚Äôt an *accident* ‚Äì agricultural civilizations simply outcompeted nomadic ones, inevitable and irresistably. Classic Malthusian trap. Maybe hunting-gathering was more enjoyable, higher life expectancy, and more conducive to human flourishing ‚Äì but in a state of *sufficiently intense competition* between peoples, in which agriculture with all its disease and oppression and pestilence was the more competitive option, everyone will end up agriculturalists or [go the way of the Comanche Indians](http://squid314.livejournal.com/340809.html).

- 8. Arms races. Large countries can spend anywhere from 5% to 30% of their budget on defense. In the absence of war ‚Äì a condition which has mostly held for the past fifty years ‚Äì all this does is sap money away from infrastructure, health, education, or economic growth. But any country that fails to spend enough money on defense risks being invaded by a neighboring country that did. Therefore, almost all countries try to spend some money on defense. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmfvgpmzvdvnjk9020832nx4))
- From a god‚Äôs-eye-view, the best solution is world peace and no country having an army at all.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmfvhknd5ca9y2qmk2mf1x6f))
- 9. Cancer. The human body is supposed to be made up of cells living harmoniously and pooling their resources for the greater good of the organism. If a cell defects from this equilibrium by investing its resources into copying itself, it and its descendants will flourish, eventually outcompeting all the other cells and taking over the body ‚Äì at which point it dies. Or the situation may repeat, with certain cancer cells defecting against the rest of the tumor, thus slowing down its growth and causing the tumor to stagnate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmfvjphfe7yz2qhgaq51cxkd))
- From a god‚Äôs-eye-view, the best solution is all cells cooperating so that they don‚Äôt all die. From within the system, cancerous cells will proliferate and outcompete the other ‚Äì so that only the existence of the immune system keeps the natural incentive to turn cancerous in check.

- 10. The ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù describes [a political situation where](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom) some jurisdictions lure businesses by promising lower taxes and fewer regulations. The end result is that either everyone optimizes for competitiveness ‚Äì by having minimal tax rates and regulations ‚Äì or they lose all of their business, revenue, and jobs to people who did (at which point they are pushed out and replaced by a government who will be more compliant). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmfvq13vefpxtafkfq1mdcbz))
- But even though the last one has stolen the name, all these scenarios are in fact a race to the bottom. Once one agent learns how to become more competitive by sacrificing a common value, all its competitors must also sacrifice that value or be outcompeted and replaced by the less scrupulous. Therefore, the system is likely to end up with everyone once again equally competitive, but the sacrificed value is gone forever. From a god‚Äôs-eye-view, the competitors know they will all be worse off if they defect, but from within the system, given insufficient coordination it‚Äôs impossible to avoid.

- People ask why we can‚Äôt reform the education system. But right now students‚Äô incentive is to go to the most prestigious college they can get into so employers will hire them ‚Äì whether or not they learn anything. Employers‚Äô incentive is to get students from the most prestigious college they can so that they can defend their decision to their boss if it goes wrong ‚Äì whether or not the college provides value added. And colleges‚Äô incentive is to do whatever it takes to get more prestige, as measured in *US News and World Report* rankings ‚Äì whether or not it helps students. Does this lead to huge waste and poor education? Yes. Could the Education God notice this and make some Education Decrees that lead to a vastly more efficient system? Easily! But since there‚Äôs no Education God everybody is just going to follow their own incentives, which are only partly correlated with education or efficiency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgbdavzfkska7xkh7c9hvm4))
- From a god‚Äôs eye view, it‚Äôs easy to say things like ‚ÄúStudents should only go to college if they think they will get something out of it, and employers should hire applicants based on their competence and not on what college they went to‚Äù. From within the system, everyone‚Äôs already following their own incentives correctly, so unless the incentives change the system won‚Äôt either. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgbjfg4e4e5w1adkz71e4pn))
- The modern research community *knows* they aren‚Äôt producing the best science they could be. There‚Äôs lots of publication bias, statistics are done in a confusing and misleading way out of sheer inertia, and replications often happen very late or not at all. And sometimes someone will say something like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe people are too dumb to fix Science. All we would have to do is require early registration of studies to avoid publication bias, turn this new and powerful statistical technique into the new standard, and accord higher status to scientists who do replication experiments. It would be really simple and it would vastly increase scientific progress. I must just be smarter than all existing scientists, since I‚Äôm able to think of this and they aren‚Äôt.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgbmpjqbkaead6p3see085q))
- And yeah. That would work for the Science God. He could just make a Science Decree that everyone has to use the right statistics, and make another Science Decree that everyone must accord replications higher status. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgbn5c6qmfd66q5s327g76b))
- But things that work from a god‚Äôs-eye view don‚Äôt work from within the system. No individual scientist has an incentive to unilaterally switch to the new statistical technique for her own research, since it would make her research less likely to produce earth-shattering results and since it would just confuse all the other scientists. They just have an incentive to want everybody else to do it, at which point they would follow along. And no individual journal has an incentive to unilaterally switch to early registration and publishing negative results, since it would just mean their results are less interesting than that other journal who only publishes ground-breaking discoveries. From within the system, everyone is following their own incentives and will continue to do so. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgbncbt2vqqmqhs4xy964g0))
- Government are competing against one another to get elected or promoted. And suppose part of optimizing for electability is optimizing campaign donations from corporations ‚Äì or maybe [it isn‚Äôt](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/19/plutocracy-isnt-about-money/), but officials *think* it is. Officials who try to mess with corporate welfare may lose the support of corporations and be outcompeted by officials who promise to keep it intact.

- 14. Congress. Only 9% of Americans like it, suggesting a [lower approval rating than](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-somewhere-below-cockroaches-traffic-jams-and-nickleback-in-americans-esteem.html) cockroaches, head lice, or traffic jams. However, [62% of people](http://www.gallup.com/poll/162362/americans-down-congress-own-representative.aspx) who know who their own Congressional representative is approve of them. In theory, it should be *really hard* to have a democratically elected body that maintains a 9% approval rating for more than one election cycle. In practice, every representative‚Äôs incentive is to appeal to his or her constituency while throwing the rest of the country under the bus ‚Äì something at which they apparently succeed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgcgrjzgbvqxskvrt5xdzxc))

- A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don‚Äôt take it die out. Eventually, everyone‚Äôs relative status is about the same as before, but everyone‚Äôs absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been ‚Äì in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.

In fact, it‚Äôs a pretty good bet that two utopias that are polar opposites both sound better than our own world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmgcxbp8gertv8mpndcxgdf9))
- It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing that random nobodies can think up states of affairs better than the one we actually live in. And in fact most of them can‚Äôt.

- Any human with above room temperature IQ can design a utopia. The reason our current system isn‚Äôt a utopia is that *it wasn‚Äôt designed by humans*. Just as you can look at an arid terrain and determine what shape a river will one day take by assuming water will obey gravity, so you can look at a civilization and determine what shape its institutions will one day take by assuming people will obey incentives.

- Just as people can level terrain and build canals, so people can alter the incentive landscape in order to build better institutions.

I mean, sometimes they *are* greedy. But other times they‚Äôre just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn‚Äôt do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do.

- And as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems.

- Things are easy to solve from a god‚Äôs-eye-view, so if everyone comes together into a superorganism, that superorganism can solve problems with ease and finesse.

- Turning ‚Äúsatisfying customers‚Äù and ‚Äúsatisfying citizens‚Äù into the *outputs* of optimization processes was one of civilization‚Äôs greatest advances and the reason why capitalist democracies have so outperformed other systems.

- The best known solution to the Prisoners‚Äô Dilemma is for the mob boss (playing the role of a governor) to threaten to shoot any prisoner who defects. The solution to companies polluting and harming workers is government regulations against such. Governments solve arm races *within* a country by maintaining a monopoly on the use of force, and it‚Äôs easy to see that if a truly effective world government ever arose, international military buildups would end pretty quickly.

([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmj42rg5cfh09w8ahy631cjn))
- But these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera ‚Äì there‚Äôs no reason they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and indeed they aren‚Äôt. Governments can in theory keep corporations, citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are many traps that governments themselves can fall into.

- This is the much-maligned ‚Äì I think unfairly ‚Äì argument in favor of monarchy. A monarch is an unincentivized incentivizer. He *actually* has the god‚Äôs-eye-view and is outside of and above every system. He has permanently won all competitions and is not competing for anything, and therefore he is perfectly free of Moloch and of the incentives that would otherwise channel his incentives into predetermined paths. Aside from a few very theoretical proposals like my [Shining Garden](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/06/raikoth-laws-language-and-society/), monarchy is the *only* system that does this.

- As technological advance increases, the rare confluence will come to an end. New opportunities to throw values under the bus for increased competitiveness will arise. New ways of copying agents to increase the population will soak up our excess resources and resurrect Malthus‚Äô unquiet spirit. Capitalism and democracy, previously our protectors, will figure out ways to route around their inconvenient dependence on human values.

- Each component of Gnon detailed above had and has a strong hand in creating us, our ideas, our wealth, and our dominance, and thus has been good in that respect, but we must remember that [he] can and will turn on us when circumstances change. Evolution becomes dysgenic, features of the memetic landscape promote ever crazier insanity, productivity turns to famine when we can no longer compete to afford our own existence, and order turns to chaos and bloodshed when we neglect martial strength or are overpowered from outside. These processes are not good or evil overall; they are neutral, in the horrorist Lovecraftian sense of the word [‚Ä¶]
  Instead of the destructive free reign of evolution and the sexual market, we would be better off with deliberate and conservative patriarchy and eugenics driven by the judgement of man within the constraints set by Gnon. Instead of a ‚Äúmarketplace of ideas‚Äù that more resembles a festering petri-dish breeding superbugs, a rational theocracy. Instead of unhinged techno-commercial exploitation or naive neglect of economics, a careful bottling of the productive economic dynamic and planning for a controlled techno-singularity. Instead of politics and chaos, a strong hierarchical order with martial sovereignty. These things are not to be construed as complete proposals; we don‚Äôt really know how to accomplish any of this. They are better understood as goals to be worked towards. This post concerns itself with the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, rather than the ‚Äúhow‚Äù.

- ‚ÄúGnon‚Äù is [Nick Land‚Äôs](http://www.xenosystems.net/the-cult-of-gnon/) shorthand for ‚ÄúNature And Nature‚Äôs God‚Äù, except the A is changed to an O and the whole thing is reversed, because Nick Land react to comprehensibility the same way as vampires to sunlight.
  Land argues that humans should be more Gnon-conformist (pun Gnon-intentional). He says we do all these stupid things like divert useful resources to feed those who could never survive on their own, or supporting the poor in ways that encourage dysgenic reproduction, or allowing cultural degeneration to undermine the state. This means our society is denying natural law, basically listening to Nature say things like ‚Äúthis cause has this effect‚Äù and putting our fingers in our ears and saying ‚ÄúNO IT DOESN‚ÄôT‚Äù. Civilizations that do this too much tend to decline and fall, which is Gnon‚Äôs fair and dispassionately-applied punishment for violating His laws. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnpenrdye5qanwsvz190d2m))
- But a brief digression into social evolution. Societies, like animals, evolve. The ones that survive spawn memetic descendants ‚Äì for example, the success of Britan allowed it to spin off Canada, Australia, the US, et cetera. Thus, we expect societies that exist to be somewhat optimized for stability and prosperity. I think this is one of the strongest conservative arguments. Just as a random change to a letter in the human genome will probably be deleterious rather than beneficial since humans are a complicated fine-tuned system whose genome has been pre-optimized for survival ‚Äì so most changes to our cultural DNA will disrupt some institution that evolved to help Anglo-American (or whatever) society outcompete its real and hypothetical rivals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmjdyqk6szy4e0atpp0bqz))
- The liberal counterargument to that is that evolution is [a blind idiot alien god](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/) that optimizes for stupid things and has no concern with human value. Thus, the fact that some species of wasps paralyze caterpillars, lay their eggs inside of it, and have its young devour the still-living paralyzed caterpillar from the inside doesn‚Äôt set off evolution‚Äôs moral sensor, because evolution doesn‚Äôt *have* a moral sensor because evolution doesn‚Äôt care.

- Suppose that in fact patriarchy is adaptive to societies because it allows women to spend all their time bearing children who can then engage in productive economic activity and fight wars. The social evolutionary processes that cause societies to adopt patriarchy *still* have exactly as little concern for its moral effects on women as the biological evolutionary processes that cause wasps to lay their eggs in caterpillars. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnmmse1w24pmapdtr7ztb0m))
- Evolution doesn‚Äôt care. But we do care. There‚Äôs a tradeoff between Gnon-compliance ‚Äì saying ‚ÄúOkay, the strongest possible society is a patriarchal one, we should implement patriarchy‚Äù and our human values ‚Äì like women who want to do something other than bear children.

- Too far to one side of the tradeoff, and we have unstable impoverished societies that die out for going against natural law. Too far to the other side, and we have lean mean fighting machines that are murderous and miserable. Think your local anarchist commune versus Sparta.

- And then there‚Äôs us. Man has his own telos, when he is allowed the security to act and the clarity to reason out the consequences of his actions. When unafflicted by coordination problems and unthreatened by superior forces, able to act as a gardener rather than just another subject of the law of the jungle, he tends to build and guide a wonderful world for himself. He tends to favor good things and avoid bad, to create secure civilizations with polished sidewalks, beautiful art, happy families, and glorious adventures. I will take it as a given that this telos is identical with ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúshould‚Äù.
  Thus we have our wildcard and the big question of futurism. Will the future be ruled by the usual four horsemen of Gnon for a future of meaningless gleaming techno-progress burning the cosmos or a future of dysgenic, insane, hungry, and bloody dark ages; or will the telos of man prevail for a future of meaningful art, science, spirituality, and greatness?

- The project of civilization [is] for man to graduate from the metaphorical savage, subject to the law of the jungle, to the civilized gardener who, while theoretically still subject to the law of the jungle, is so dominant as to limit the usefulness of that model.
  This need not be done globally; we may only be able to carve out a small walled garden for ourselves, but make no mistake, even if only locally, the project of civilization is to capture Gnon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnp89era8rbg84fw19cp2z8))
- I can imagine ways that a ‚Äúrational theocracy‚Äù and ‚Äúconservative patriarchy‚Äù might not be terrible to live under, given exactly the right conditions. But you don‚Äôt get to choose exactly the right conditions. You get to choose the extremely constrained set of conditions that ‚Äúcapture Gnon‚Äù. As outside civilizations compete against you, your conditions will become more and more constrained. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnpdee89909thzd9mscywgx))
- But the current rulers of the universe ‚Äì call them what you want, Moloch, Gnon, whatever ‚Äì want us dead, and with us everything we value. Art, science, love, philosophy, consciousness itself, the entire bundle. And since I‚Äôm not down with that plan, I think defeating them and taking their place is a pretty high priority.
  The opposite of a trap is a garden. The only way to avoid having all human values gradually ground down by optimization-competition is to install a Gardener over the entire universe who optimizes for human values. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmnpv5tfmygwdvv30cy8ax7n))

- And the whole point of Bostrom‚Äôs [*Superintelligence*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0199678111&linkCode=as2&tag=slastacod-20&linkId=MLLWPLYEFTPAGE4X) is that this is within our reach. Once humans can design machines that are smarter than we are, by definition they‚Äôll be able to design machines which are smarter than they are, which can design machines smarter than they are, and so on in a feedback loop so tiny that it will smash up against the physical limitations for intelligence in a comparatively lightning-short amount of time. If multiple competing entities were likely to do that at once, we would be super-doomed. But the sheer speed of the cycle makes it possible that we will end up with one entity light-years ahead of the rest of civilization, so much so that it can suppress any competition ‚Äì including competition for its title of most powerful entity ‚Äì permanently. In the very near future, we are going to lift *something* to Heaven. It might be Moloch. But it might be something on our side. If it‚Äôs on our side, it can *kill Moloch dead*.

- And if that entity shares human values, it can allow human values to flourish unconstrained by natural law. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmzrrs5tvw3j12gcx7rfckfj))
