## Highlights
- history as we learn it in school tends to concentrate on the puppets and ignore the vast formless things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmw3gg0z4aat18d5x66tqd9k))
- In a previous essay, I mentioned a pattern of refactored agency in which human beings lack agency and merely respond to incentives. I said they were ‚Äúactors‚Äù reading from the ‚Äúscript their incentives wrote for them‚Äù, and anyone who deviated from the part would be outcompeted and replaced.

- This seems to broadly describe most historical figures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmw3pwepy40byvrsjcasjxtc))
- But the puppetry expands past individuals toward whole empires and movements. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmw3q0n4n8rq0nmae5m1j62b))
- What are these Vast Formless Things giving them their orders? I mentioned liking *Guns, Germs and Steel*, and I think Diamond has done a good job of proving geography has important historical effects. But geography is fixed, not exactly the sort of thing that‚Äôs going to cause revolutions. So after that last post you probably won‚Äôt be surprised to hear I think the vastest and most formless Vast Formless Thing of all is technological progress.

- The largest and furthest-reaching political changes of all time have invariably been the effect of technological progress. The largest of these, the transition from egalitarian bands to the ultrahierarchical divine monarchies of the Bronze Age, seems to have been mostly the effect of the Agricultural Revolution and its corollaries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmw3ty4ea5jmveem6fk0y2c5))
- ‚Äì Need for a guarantee that the crops you planted will still be yours at harvest time inspires idea of private property 
  ‚Äì Sedentary lifestyle + concept of property allow accumulation of wealth 
  ‚Äì Accumulation of wealth requires law enforcement to protect wealth 
  ‚Äì Excess food allows specialization of labor 
  ‚Äì Requirement for law enforcement + specialized labor leads to creation of warrior caste 
  ‚Äì Powerful warrior caste + everyone else being farmers and losing the martial skills they enjoyed as hunters leads to warrior caste taking over. 
  ‚Äì Need for large irrigation/flood control projects in many areas leads to very centralized government ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmw4yr24y9m98tks091mvkg4))
- the Generic Bronze Age Government ‚Äì a god-king served by a bunch of warrior-nobles, plus massive militarism and slavery ‚Äì probably just made sense given the circumstances. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxdkg9wygpdf1v3netyr0jc))
- governments have a good way of kind of converging to a local optimum. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxdkpvp6n090yrxt678vmrd))
- After the Neolithic, one of the most clear-cut examples of technology changing social structure was the fall of feudalism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxdwxa04c4ba03vbeh1hbys))
- Then some new weapons were invented: pikes, longbows, crossbows, but especially firearms. Now you can get someone who *hasn‚Äôt* trained 10,000 hours, give them a few days of weapon training, hand them a gun or a crossbow or something, and they can kill an armored knight. Now the power doesn‚Äôt belong to the people with the best connections among the warrior nobility, it belongs to the people with enough money to hire soldiers and supply them with guns.

- The printing press was an even bigger deal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxe0460kgbqvvvsc1pb367f))
- Among just the simpler and more direct effects:
  ‚Äì Protestant Reformation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxe0mwtg9mhx56d1h9w95g9))
- ‚Äì Newspapers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxe1fwyc69daz2hc5k7yp73))
- ‚Äì The Renaissance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxe1qyhk5v7ncm93g5wxaxf))
- ‚Äì Scientific Revolution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxe1mpa5e8dn9xgb20cmhjg))
- ‚Äì Rise of nationalism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmxe3xmr8c6p7zma7c4nv86q))

- the biggest changes in history have been predetermined reactions to different technological conditions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmys1srms9rj4bjmjkg1zhjz))
- I think my claim here is that cultures and ideologies have a sort of homeostatic regulatory mechanism that fits them to their conditions. This is why all Bronze Age cultures converged upon divine monarchies, and all medieval empires converged upon feudalism, and proooobably why all modern cultures converge upon liberal democracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmys3gvf9xm8e71st84xwzzx))
- China didn‚Äôt *plan* to approach the Western model of government. It was just what happened to them automatically when they wanted their country to stop being a hellhole. The same is happening now in Burma, somewhat more slowly in Cuba, and in other places around the world. Even the countries skipping the ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù part have been aping the Industrial Revolution, womens‚Äô rights, and so on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmysadt3gbf0aq956qd314qv))
- This is probably because many features of liberal democracy are adaptations to our current technological climate. For example, women‚Äôs lib seems like an adaptation both to the Sexual Revolution and to the demographic transition where people are no longer having like twenty children all the time. Representative government seems like an adaptation to mass media that allows everyone to be aware of, and usually upset about, what the country‚Äôs leadership is doing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyt48nxm09pwxshhh31gp90))
- If you like these things, you can call it cultural evolution and assume we‚Äôre approaching some great goal of perfection. If you don‚Äôt like them, you can call them patches, such that once the demographic transition screws up traditional gender roles, we need women‚Äôs lib as a patch to contain the damage. Either way, you better not take off that patch. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyt5jfzy73qaj6vp2gwgv23))
- Gloria Steinem is a puppet. If she‚Äôs part of some movement, even a large saecular movement calling itself Progressivism, they, too, are puppets. It is stupid to get upset at puppets. If you rip them up, the puppeteer will get new ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyt91ze10vy5dznw9xwh45v))
- If you don‚Äôt like women‚Äôs lib, your enemy isn‚Äôt Gloria Steinem. Your enemy is the Vast Formless Thing controlling Gloria Steinem. In this case, that would be [the demographic transition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyt9as0hfczx7q5wkwpzrwp))
- Any statistic in which the present differs from the past is much more likely to be a result of technology than of politics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyvcht08eznfjwys7er2qk0))
- I suspect that the most valuable features of past societies ‚Äì the ones that we read fantasy books to recapture, the ones that make Renaissance Faires and Medieval Times so attractive ‚Äì have nothing to do with politics and cannot be restored through politics. In order to regain them, you‚Äôre going to have to roll back the Industrial Revolution. Needless to say, that makes fighting against the demographic transition look easy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyvdb00mmd3wb1z4te3nfn5))
- I tend to agree with Reactionaries that cultures have a mechanism that gradually adapts them to their conditions. This may not be morally good ‚Äì if the conditions are ‚Äúcotton is very lucrative‚Äù then the ‚Äúevolutionarily advantageous‚Äù adaptation for a society may be to institute slavery ‚Äì but they are at least effective and stable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyvjy09kzajvbg8xcc3422h))
- But a 1600s culture with 2013 technology would be like Windows 3.11 on a 2013 computer: a complete mismatch and a complete disaster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyvp7vwzpx45ct7zeyzw1h3))
- The Reactionaries are correct that we live in a scary time, a time when changes in technology are way outpacing our ability to have any idea how to cope as a society. Maybe if you froze technology at 2013 levels for a hundred years, we would get a pretty good idea what to do with it and would build a culture as well-adapted to our technology level as the Bourbon French were to theirs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyvqdqy08grjr2ma6rgktnb))
- Our goal was to show that, even granting Reactionaries all their assumptions about the superiority of past civilizations, trying to restore them is impossible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyvw6z5nfj3v8at3cbbvg90))
- We noted that the driving force of large-scale historical change was technological progress. That societies underwent cultural evolution into forms that were most adapted to the technological conditions of their age. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyw47f5dqfew8c04xakjz1d))
- Then we noted that what looks like political progress from the outside is just humans reacting to the shifting landscape of incentives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyw4r5prxn7h1gxvre99ty8))
- We accused Reactionaries of condemning or excusing such movements as if they were contingent human creations, and of acting like pushing a few humans or institutions out of the way here or there would change them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyw55chmt89q0x1c7edn5e1))
- Then we accused Reactionaries of a bit of a double-standard, excusing traditional societies‚Äô lesser wealth and health by placing the blame on technological progress, but being unwilling to let Progressives do the same in areas where technological progress has inevitably made us worse off, such as the production of feelings of social alienation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyw5eq80qxfbw4hs7jynr8v))
- Finally, we accused Reactionaries of arguing that past societies were well-adapted, without specifying well-adapted to *what*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmyw5wqtwtx7evksqr5wm7hc))
