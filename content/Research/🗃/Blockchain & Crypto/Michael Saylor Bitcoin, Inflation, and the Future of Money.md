## Highlights
- > when when an economist says the inflation rate is two percent that's a scalar and when an economist says it's not a problem to print more money because the velocity of the money is very low the monetary velocity is low 09:30that's another scalar okay so the truth of the matter is inflation is not a scalar inflation is an in-dimensional vector money velocity is not a scalar um develo saying what's the velocity of money oh oh it's slow or it's fast it ignores the question of what medium is the money moving through in the same way that you know 10:00what's the speed of sound okay well what is sound right sound you know sound is uh is a compression wave it's energy uh moving through a medium but the speed is different so for example the speed of sound through air is different than the speed of sound through water and and a sound moves faster through water it moves faster through a solid and it moves faster to a stiffer solid so there isn't one ([TimeÂ 0:09:17](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cd7a814d8ed0008cfca1a))
- > the fundamental problem is if you see the world as a scalar you simply pick the one number which is which supports whatever you want to do and you ignore the universe of other consequences from your behavior ([TimeÂ 0:10:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cd7bc70c6f20008cbe8fc))
- > i'm really shocked today that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics has been captured by scalar arithmetic 13:00for example if if you read you know read any article in new york times or the wall street journal right they just refer to there's an inflation number or the the cpi or the inflation rate is x and if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation generally they're all based upon the idea that inflation equals cpi and then they try to extrapolate from that and you just get nowhere with it ([TimeÂ 0:12:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cd80f70c6f20008cbe8fd))
- > you can pretty much 17:00create any inflation rate you want by constructing a market basket a weighted basket of products or services or assets that yield you the answer ([TimeÂ 0:16:58](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdac5b54d430008474643))
- > my criticism of economist is rather than embracing inflation based upon its fundamental idea which is the rate at which the price of things go 19:30up right they've been captured by a mainstream conventional thinking to immediately equate inflation to the government issued cpi or government-issued pce or government-issued ppi measure which was never the rate at which things go up it's simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and services the government wishes to track go up 20:00now the problem with that is is two big things one thing is the government gets to create the market basket and so they keep changing what's in the basket over time so i mean if if i keep tr if i said three years ago you should go see ten concerts a year and the concert tickets now cost two hundred dollars each now it's two thousand dollars a year to go see concerts now i'm in charge of calculating inflation so i redefine you know your entertainment quota for the year to be 20:30eight netflix streaming concerts and now they don't cost two thousand dollars they cost nothing and there is no inflation but you don't get your concerts right so the problem starts with continually changing the definition of the market basket but in my opinion that's not the biggest problem the more the more egregious problem is the the fundamental idea that assets aren't products or services 21:00assets can't be inflated with an asset a house a share of apple stock um a bond um any a bitcoin is an asset um or uh a picasso painting so not a consumable good not a uh not not an apple that you can eat right if i throw away an asset then uh i'm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it so 21:30what happens if i change the policy such that let's take the class example a million dollar bond at a five percent interest rate gives you fifty thousand dollars a year in risk-free income you might retire on fifty thousand dollars a year in a low-cost jurisdiction so the cost of social security or early retirement is one million dollars when the interest rate is five percent uh during the the crisis of march of 2020 the interest rate went on a 10-year bond went to 50 basis points 22:00okay so now the cost of that bond is 10 million dollars okay the cost of social security went from a million dollars to 10 million dollars so if you wanted to work your entire life save money and then retire risk-free and live happily ever after on a 50 000 salary living on a beach in mexico wherever you wanted to go you had hyperinflation the cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10 over the course of you know some amount of time in fact 22:30in that case that was like over the course of about 12 years right as the inflation rate ground down the asset traded up but the you know the conventional view is oh that's not a problem because it's good that that assets it's good that the bond is highly priced because we own the bond or um what's the problem with the inflation rate in housing being 19 it's an awful problem for a 22 year old that's starting their first job that's 23:00saving money to buy a house but it would be characterized as a benefit to society by a conventional economist who would say well housing asset values are higher because of interest rate fluctuation and now the economy's got more wealth and uh and so that's that's viewed as a benefit ([TimeÂ 0:19:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdb5e2d7ee800082ed9b6))
- > a conventional view of inflation as cpi understates the human misery that's in inflicted upon the working class and and on uh mainstream companies uh by uh by the political class and so it's a massive shift of wealth from the working 24:00class to the property class it's a massive shift of power from the free market uh to the centrally governed or the controlled market it's a massive shift of power from the people to the government ([TimeÂ 0:23:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdb832d7ee800082ed9b7))
- > on average it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply is about seven percent a year all the 26:00way up to the year 2020 if you look at the s p index which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks it returned about 10 percent if you talk to 10 a year for 100 years the money supply is expanding at 7 100 years if you actually talk to economists or you look at the the economy and you ask the question how fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year generally about two to three percent 26:30like the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a two and a half three percent improvement a year as measured by gdp is that are you okay with that not sure i'm not sure i'd go that far yet but i would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff yeah and if you ask the question how much more efficiently will we do the stuff next year than this year or how what's the value of all of our 27:00innovations and inventions and investments in the past 12 months you'd be hard-pressed to say we get two percent better typical investor thinks they they're 10 better every year so if you look at what's going on really when you're holding a million dollars of stocks and you're getting a 10 gain a year you really get a seven percent expansion of the money supply you're getting a two or three percent gain under best circumstances and 27:30another way to say that is if the money supply stopped expanding at seven percent a year the s p yield might be three percent and not ten percent it probably should be now that that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental questions like if i borrow a billion dollars and pay three percent interest and the money supply expands at seven to ten percent a year and i ended up making a ten percent return on a you know billion dollar investment 28:00paying three percent interest is that fair and who who suffered so that i could do that because in an environment where you're just inflating the money supply and you're holding the assets constant it stands the reason that the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply and the difference in asset appreciations is going to be a function of the scarce desirable quality of the assets and to what extent can i make 28:30more of them and to what extent are they are they truly limited in supply ([TimeÂ 0:25:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdbe42d7ee800082ed9b8))
- > money is monetary energy or economic energy 29:30and the economic energy has to find its way into a medium so if you want to move it rapidly as a medium of exchange has to find its way into currency but the money can also flow into property like a house or gold if the money flows into property it'll probably hold its value much better if the money flows into currency right if you had put a hundred thousand dollars in this house you would have 305 x return over 92 years but if you had put the money a 30:00hundred thousand dollars in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement you would have lost 99.7 percent of your wealth over the same time period so um so the the expansion of the currency creates uh creates a massive inefficiency in the society what i'll call an adiabatic lapse it's what we're doing is we're bleeding the civilization to death ([TimeÂ 0:29:24](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdc102d7ee800082ed9b9))

- > policymakers are well-intentioned but generally all all government policy is inflationary and all government it's 34:00inflammatory and inflationary so what i mean by that is you know when you have a policy uh pursuing uh supply chain independence if you have an energy policy if you have a labor policy if you have a trade policy if you have a you know any any kind of foreign policy a domestic policy a manufacturing policy every one of these medical policy every one of these policies interferes with the free market and and 34:30generally prevents some rational actor from doing it in a cheaper more efficient way ([TimeÂ 0:33:54](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdcb0a7a2a20008a1292f))

- > half the problems in the civilization are due to the fact that our understanding of economics and money is defective 40:30half 50 i don't know it's worth 500 trillion dollars worth of problems like money uh money represents all the economic energy and the civilization and it kind of equates to all the products all the services and all the assets that we have and we're ever gonna have ([TimeÂ 0:40:21](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdd4cb54d430008474645))
- > inflation is completely misunderstood it's a much bigger problem than we understand it to be we need to introduce engineering and science techniques into economics if we want to further the human condition all government policy is inflationary you know and another pernicious myth is uh inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomena so you know a famous quote by milton friedman i believe it's like it's a monetary phenomena that is inflation 42:00comes from expanding the currency supply it's a nice phrase and it's oftentimes quoted by people that are anti-inflation but again it it just signifies a lack of appreciation of what the issue is inflation is if i if i had a currency which was completely non-inflationary if if i never printed another dollar and if i eliminated fractional reserve banking from the face of the earth we'd still have inflation and we'd have 42:30inflation as long as we have government that that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies that are in the in themselves inflationary and generally they all are ([TimeÂ 0:41:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cdd9fb54d430008474646))
- > the most pernicious thing is is i get you to misunderstand the phenomena so that even when it's happening to you you don't appreciate that it's a bad thing and you think it's a good thing so if housing prices are going up 20 percent year over year and i say this is great for the american public because most most of them are home owners then i have i've misrepresented a 48:00phenomena inflation is 20 not 7 percent and then i've misrepresented it as being a positive rather than a negative and people will stare at it and you could even show them their house on fire and they would perceive it as being great because it's warming them up and they're going to save on their heat costs ([TimeÂ 0:47:33](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cde4aa7a2a20008a12931))

- > i think there's two big ideas uh the first wave of ideas were digital information and that was the internet way been running since 1990 or so for 30 years and the second wave is digital energy so if i look at digital information this idea that we want to digitally transform a book i'm going to de-materialize every book in this room into bits and then i'm going to deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion people and i'm going to do it for pretty much de minimis electricity if i can dematerialize music books education entertainment maps right that that uh is an incredibly like exothermic transaction it gives it's a crystallization when we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization we give off massive amounts of energy like if you look at what carnegie did the richest man in the world created libraries everywhere at the time and he gave away his entire fortune and now we can give a better library to every six year old for nothing and so what's the value of giving a million books to a eight billion people right that's that's the explosion in prosperity that comes from digital transformation and uh when we do it with maps you know i i transform the map i put it into a car you get in the car and the car drives you where you want to go with the map right and how much better is that than a rand mcnally atlas right here it's like it's like a million times better so the first wave of digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things which are non-conservative that is you know i could take beethoven's fifth symphony played for by the best orchestra in germany and i could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each at less than the cost of the one performance right so so i deliver culture and education and air addition and intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails and the consequences of the human race are first order generally good right the world is a better place it drives growth and you create these trillion dollar entities like apple and amazon and facebook and google and microsoft ([TimeÂ 1:06:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637ce01f2d7ee800082ed9ba))

- > the question is was it fair and and that's a very hard question to answer right did you acquire the bitcoin that you own fairly and if you roll the clock back you know you could have bought it for a nickel or a dime but that was when it was a million times more likely to fail right when the risk was greater the cost was lower and then over time the risk became lower and the cost became greater and the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace absent any powerful interested actor right it's almost if satoshi had held a million coins and then stayed engaged for 10 more years tweaking things in the background there'd still be that question but what we've got is really a beautiful thing we've got a we've got a chain reaction in cyberspace or an ideology spreading virally in the world that um that has seasoned in a fair ethical fashion sometimes it's a very violent brutal fashion with all the volatility right and there's been a lot of you know a lot of sound and fury along the way ([TimeÂ 2:47:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637cff4bab83ee0008e51a70))
- > the year 2022 is pretty catalytic for digital assets in general and for for bitcoin in particular the canadian trucker crisis i think educated hundreds of millions of people and and made them start questioning their property rights and their banks i think the ukraine war was a second shock but i think that the russian sanctions was a third shock yeah i think all three of the and i i think hyperinflation in the rest of the world is a fourth shock and then persistent inflation the us is a fifth shock so i think it's a perfect storm and if you put all these events together what do they signify they signify the rational conclusion for any person thinking about this is i'm not sure if i can trust my property i don't know if i have property rights i don't know if i can trust the bank and if i'm politically at odds with with uh the leader of my own country i'm going to lose my property and if i'm politically at odds with the owner of another country i'm still going to lose my property and when push comes to shove the banks will freeze my assets and seize them and i think that that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world such that your logical response would be i'm going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency like i'll convert my peso and lira to the dollar i'm going to convert my weak property to strong property i'm going to sell my building downtown moscow and i'd rather own a building in new york city i'd rather i'd rather own in a powerful nation than a than be stuck with a building in nigeria or a building in argentina or whatever so i'm going to sell my weak properties by strong properties i'm going to convert my physical assets to digital assets i'd rather own a digital building than on a physical building because if i had a billion dollar building in moscow who can i rent that to but if i have a billion dollar digital building i can rent it to anybody in any city in the world anybody with money and the maintenance cost is almost nothing and i can hold it for a hundred years okay so it's indestructible building and then finally i want to move from having my assets in a bank with a counterparty to self-custody assets ([TimeÂ 2:56:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637d008f1e50930008026c39))

- > things that are valued based upon fiat cash flows any commercial real estate any bond any sovereign debt any any currency itself any derivatives to those things they're all derivatives and they're all defective and they're all defective because of this persistent to 14 percent lapse inflate which we call inflation or monetary expansion ([TimeÂ 3:04:14](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd154ecaf8e00098590ae?annotationId=637d01217bbecd0008cd5e92))
