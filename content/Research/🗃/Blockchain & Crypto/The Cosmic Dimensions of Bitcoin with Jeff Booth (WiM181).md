## Highlights
- > all we are is energy storage and compute [Music] um and if you think what a cell is what a what a plant is what we are what our brains are energy storage and compute yeah and why that's actually a really important concept is 17:00um we link together because we have limited storage even though the brands incredible flex can do amazing things we have we have limited storage capacity we have and and as out of that limited storage capacity because some of these neurons firing and synapses firing are look crazy complex they create super highways of information but we can't and and you can recall things certain things you're practicing all the time or doing all the time really easily you can't but you can't hold that 17:30information across everything so you have to simplify your kind of your models um on that it's actually why we it's why we narrow our intelligence we narrow our field domain of field so we're really good at something specialization expense is something else and how economies grew as a result of that and and so it but but for that to happen for that for economies to grow as a result of that specialization or the division of labor 18:00what we do is we link together all of our minds and by linking together our minds we create a super computer right and and now just think that through so and the super computer the bigger the more compute more storage the more performance and why if you look through the long arrow of time and and you say actually jeffrey west wrote a book called scale 18:30where he investigated the oh yes yeah the biggest cities and then the smaller cities and and and and and the works and i found that really interesting but i think what is actually happening is to hold that super computer together requires trust and money and money is the that trust that holds a super computer together and so that being a constant if you had a bigger city with higher trust you would have you would have more super compute you'd have more idea 19:00generation and you'd have a better economy and better standard of living and if you and and that followed kind of a power law on smaller cities because you have smaller smaller compute and then where it broke is where you had big cities but no trust or regions with no trust and which makes sense because you would you would break the super computer and break through holding that kind of those brains together ([TimeÂ 0:16:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380c34c78252700083769e0))
- > the value of language is the consensus of meaning on words and most disagreements occur when two people are you know this is talking past each other typically you have your you don't have the same model for the of meaning for the word so you're in disagreement because you understand the 21:30word one way i understand the word another way but the value of language is to establish consensus on those meanings so that you don't have those mis communications ([TimeÂ 0:21:11](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380c39f78252700083769e1))
- > it's not what you're saying it's my perception of what you're saying through my model that informs ([TimeÂ 0:22:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380c3d58718540008b51ad8))
- > our entire reality is is us doing the all of these things 31:30right creating so so this was created by an idea right so somebody in somebody's brain that idea turned into reality and that reality were through a whole bunch of people thinking that idea was a good idea created a brand around this idea and a supply chain and and created this all it is was an idea in somebody's head and that is the entire market of competing ideas and and we can't predict on the other 32:00side of this we can't predict that ever change those ever changing ideas because and i use this example quite often but we would have never predicted iphone when we were using blackberry we would have ever predicted our change to a new model to a new idea and what we would do ([TimeÂ 0:31:25](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380ca82060cec000849d0d7))
- > so if you just follow that then then what you'd say is no central organization could ever out predict what our changing 32:30predictions will change because we're changing all the time we're constantly updating our models right based based on based on new inputs so our world's changing we're designing the world we want to live in at all times um and we can up and we can't figure out when when that change is moving through society faster and faster and faster and what we'll do in that new new reality [Music] any better than a central 33:00control agent could do it for us so if you had a central control agent that actually tried to essentially say what society would look like it could never actually work you'd have to you'd have to you'd have to stop evolution you'd have to stop right right um and and we won't put up with that ([TimeÂ 0:32:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380cabf060cec000849d0d8))
- > to try and engage in central planning is to 34:00fight the algorithm of evolution itself ([TimeÂ 0:33:57](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380caeaa730ea0008bfd786))
- > we're going through a transition in time where a whole bunch of models are being disrupted yeah because they've been the same for a long time and we've taken and we've grown up in those models that that are that it like an inflation inflation is required for the productive economy nobody even questions it because you lived in it so long when when if you actually question it it's ludicrous right 35:30but but people don't question that that that core tenant just because they haven't questioned that part of the model and they've been inside a system that it looked like that might work yeah and and and so now as it starts to not work and you start to see the feedback around feedback systems of it not working around the world and what the next steps are more and more people start to question that base assumption and the models change right that's what's 36:00happening in bitcoin and that's why this conversation on bitcoin is so intellectually stimulating and curious and because you're around other people who are really curious about these sorts of things um and and they're trying to find that root and update update their models and what and once you and that's why once you see it you can't unsee it ([TimeÂ 0:35:06](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380cb32060cec000849d0d9))
- > if you have a technology process that's supposed to be driving price down as that efficiency is spreading out to society and you have an error code in money that's that has to go exactly the other way and print money to offset it to pretend we can still live in a society like that ([TimeÂ 0:38:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380cbd5060cec000849d0da))
- > the more we can rev up this distributed super computer with let's say high integrity money right money that money as a useful fiction that lets us trade time and energy the more closely or the higher resolution that useful fiction of money maps on to the reality of time and energy the more that supercomputer runs the more civilized we become the alternative being turn off the 57:30supercomputer and be animals basically ([TimeÂ 0:57:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380cdceeafed30008d13d06))
- > that's actually why prices must fall right because if prices were made to go up through the distortion of money forever then then if you follow that logic then the only then the only way you could you could retain that power over control over other people yeah through coercion yeah and and that keeps going and then the state essentially changes laws 58:00and be able to to keep that coercion and you ruined the super computer as a result ([TimeÂ 0:57:36](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380cdf023b6660008031d33))
- > if you just said that what that would have to look like at a humanity at entering our level of intelligence where we're transitioning to machine intelligence if humanity didn't make the transition to a money that allowed that topic to happen it would blow up right because because you'd have to allow that abundance yes use the technology to be broadly transferred to everybody in the in the form of freedom or free time or or you would or you would go to war fighting over rocks ([TimeÂ 1:02:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380ceb2060cec000849d74e))
- > we've seen technology advances before but not at the rate we're seeing today yeah driven by energy storage and compute our intelligence feeding back on itself at higher and higher levels searching higher orders of energy storage and computing that take it beyond our bodies yet we can't see it because we're in a different system ([TimeÂ 1:03:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/633fd15073e7780009a9dd1e?annotationId=6380cec9eafed30008d13d07))
