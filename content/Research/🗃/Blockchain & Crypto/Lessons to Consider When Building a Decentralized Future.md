	- Authoritarianism has a universal appeal. It is easy and comfortable to be taken care of, to put your trust in authority. Liberty is risky. It takes work. It also takes humility. There is a hubris inherent in knowing you are right and aiming for a system that makes it as easy as possible for you to get your way. It is much harder to believe you‚Äôre right but to understand you *might* not be and to live in a system with people with whom you might disagree.

- This is the problem of governance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5asjra4ar1gh1gtzz3vfct))
- There is a tendency humans have for recency bias. We believe humans of the present know better. We are more advanced. We‚Äôve evolved past the issues and limitations of our ancestors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5awbb804bvgwrnrc4ag8xt))
- The fact is that human nature is constant. It doesn‚Äôt represent a problem to be solved but rather a reality that must always be grappled with, harnessed, leveraged and restricted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5awfbcrxppwap9je35y9na))
- On July 4, 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence:
  > ‚ÄúWhen in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature‚Äôs God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5ec69mbj5c8m80e5pw2vtp))
- What launched from this declaration was one of the most radical experiments in popular self-governance in history, and one that has endured for more than 200 years. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5edw5zcseyskcsagpvngtz))
- The launch of the Bitcoin network set into motion an unprecedented movement of innovation and wealth creation, an event akin to the launch of the internet, the founding of a new country and the U.S. leaving the gold standard wrapped in one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5esq0nxp6fwv01k2ktaxxk))
- What often gets overlooked however is the harder question that will actually enable us to create a truly enduring, inclusive and global financial system: in a society with a diversity of opinions and interests, how do you determine what is the ‚Äúright‚Äù decision to execute in the first place? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq7x08ge76ws8bb4nvr92mv5))
- On the one hand, in the United States‚Äô founding you have not just the first modern attempt at self-governance, but also the first attempt to codify governance and replace a monarch with a system of laws, ([negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights)) rights and constrained government. On the other hand, with the creation of Bitcoin, you have the first attempt to literally write a system of rules governing human interaction into code run on machines, creating the first objective system of governance the world had ever seen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5ewa6y6y1q5yqvdd04ynhf))
- If money is how we transfer and express value within a society, Bitcoin codified an objective rule set governing that society for the first time ever. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq5ewpsngnr216h57eyk82np))
