- Rather than serving primarily in the background for labor or infrastructure, technological advances are in the immediate foreground‚Äîin the palm of our hands‚Äîcentral to the most intimate and consequential aspects of our lives, including education, communication, relationships, and politics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1gn6g56ebtv6mzntcrk5m3))
- The products and services of the modern digital economy continue to bring technology ever closer to the core of the human experience‚Äîand ‚Äúthe digital age‚Äù is just getting started. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr1gnj12cws5nxfawdhx84zr))
- Technologies encode practices and values into the societies that adopt them. This happens in many ways, often unpredictably and unintentionally, as the second- and third-order effects of technologies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr9f28m7g89924mksrcmy5n8))
- It could be argued that the ecology of technologies surrounding the smartphone‚Äîthe smartphone technology ecosystem‚Äîhas resulted in an epoch-making shift in how humans relate to each other and the world around them. It has changed human behavior and psychology more profoundly in just two decades than perhaps any prior technology (religion, cultural movement, or empire) ever did in an equivalent timeframe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr9f7t2nbpxma6s6315fjewy))
- At this point the psychological and cultural effects of widespread, habitual, and nearly non-stop use of these devices has become apparent. Philosophers and public intellectuals are taking for granted the relevance of theorizing about the high-tech future of the smartphone technology ecosystem as an extension and deepening of the human mind[[3]](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-3). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gr9fjda3g2pzmeyzbhwp6nt1))
- Technologies always create the potential for new forms of behavior, values, and thought, even when the technology is not explicitly made to do so. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0acpth9xm01j42kdqvvrf))
- Instant messaging and ‚ÄúFacetime‚Äù have come to replace in-person contact as the default modalities of communication. Easy access to nearly unlimited information also inevitably changes the value we place on skills such as memorization, information recall, and the ability to study and learn from books. A GPS device on your phone is designed to get you where you need to go, and it does that. It was not designed to weaken your sense of direction and make you dependent upon it to feel safe in urban or rural areas. Yet it also does that.

- Any new human-made tool has the potential to shape what is considered to be valuable and why. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0dpcyy3g5se3ddvkp5mhv))
- there is a clear correlation between the availability of bathroom scales and increases in cases of anorexia[[5]](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-5). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0jv57sxtm11sfskk70tfg))
- The scale increased the salience and visibility of body weight, changing the ways in which it could be valued, thought about, and otherwise related to psychologically. This had unforeseen outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0kgc2hq0xwwb0re77cwhe))
- Technologies are created with both values and material outcomes in mind. When technologies are brought into the world they create a future: material, social, psychological, and cultural. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0m0af4nnwnc69ca5m6bp2))
- Even a technology as simple as the plow is created with values in mind, such as ease of labor, speed of work, and a desire for food surpluses that create a feeling of safety. It serves these values by affecting material outcomes, such as preparing fields for agriculture. The plow would also lead to urban fortifications for storing and protecting food surpluses, and thus change the nature of human habitats, warfare, and architecture. The plow favors men as farmers due to the upper body strength needed to use it, which changed ideologies about the respective value of the sexes. The plow led eventually to certain forms of animal domestication, in the long run altering the relationship between humans and the natural world, and thus moving religious beliefs from animistic to theocentric. Normalization of animal-drawn plowing as the basis of agriculture made it difficult for humans to value animals as sacred and as equal or surpassing humans in worth. It is hard to worship the sacred spirit of an animal that must be beaten all day to pull a plow. Dominion over animals in this way justified the spread of a cultural narrative that humanity‚Äôs role is to control nature, rather than to be a part of nature, which laid the foundations for a mindset that eventually resulted in the industrial revolution. These and countless other changes to human minds, behaviors, and culture followed from the invention of the plow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0r36hn10rspn0ckjqar8w))
- Technologies co-evolve with value systems‚Äîneither determines the other, even though they are intimately related. Whole epochs of civilization, as ways of life and culture, come to be defined by certain sets of technologies and infrastructures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0rzeejh42c71r79p2nm9m))
- Techno-optimists largely maintain that technology is about what works for everyone‚Äîuniversal functionality‚Äîrather than what is good for everyone‚Äîuniversal morality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc0ye3ncxxmcanah994zycp))
- The goodness of the technology feels obvious, particularly when the second- and third-order effects that some users may experience only become evident later or in other domains. To many, it appears that the technology itself is not an issue‚Äîit is simply up to people to use it responsibly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grc10ky3a7e8fmxhtd7ht05j))
- Technologies are created and evolve together to form whole civilizations (see Box 1). It is important not to consider any technology as existing all by itself. Humans have come to live in massive networks of operationally related technologies, which have come to form whole ecologies and infrastructures supporting every aspect of conscious experience. Ultimately, this new human reality constitutes a technological epoch with distinct material characteristics and societal dynamics.

## New highlights added February 16, 2023 at 8:51 AM
- Technology is value-loaded: it comes with values built in. It is also values altering: technologies change and augment existing value systems. These two dynamics are related but not deterministic. We saw this above with the example of the smartphone and the plow. It is quite common that the values guiding the design of a technology are different from the value system changes that result from its widespread use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbs6c78tbyf2rdvq1dszqpr))
- A vast array of related technologies eventually become the background suppositions of a society‚Äîits most basic infrastructures‚Äîconstituting a technological epoch, or a fundamentally new kind of human-created habitat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsahqztb3gfsgr3tp5vkgb))
- This means that humans can adapt to unique and challenging environmental conditions in ways that other animals cannot, while at the same time humans are able to shape and create unique environmental conditions to fit our needs and values. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsesqqca48bepeg6ccbnj4))
- A new technology affects existing practices of human competition and cooperation, and sets new selection pressures that confer advantage to early adopters of the technology. New technologies themselves become uniquely valuable insofar as they confer advantage. Use of the new technology therefore becomes effectively obligatory, as failure to make use of it results in the loss of competitive advantage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbskeqefrqvjeknwzm4kc9a))
- Sometimes, adopting a new technology becomes basically obligatory. Technology creates a need for itself; it makes itself valuable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsp53rfs2n5qn87ez60j0s))
- Our most prominent technologies tend to shape the metaphors we use to explain the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsws8ekenrz4zp2n1a0jmg))
- Second- and third-order effects on values, culture, power, and personality must be given due consideration. We can no longer limit ourselves to thinking only about the impacts across material economies, finance, and ecology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbsy97ffkze9tffbmb69692))
- Technology is intrinsic to our being and becoming as individuals and social systems. The rapid emergence and saturation of digital technologies‚Äîlargely based upon fast-paced nihilistic design‚Äîhas resulted in what might be called an *accidental planetary computational stack.*[[15]](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral/#fn-15) This means that the technological environments we find ourselves in, with their visible and invisible effects on our bodies, minds, cultures, societies, and ecosystems, did not result from design. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbt0mwkbcs0pktxc53xwe67))
- technologists should hold ethics as the fundamental priority in the design process, with engineering following its lead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbt82xyfyv2vr1h8ccqnp5z))
- Finally, we must seek to clarify the fundamentals of human value systems. It is vital that we factor how psychological processes work in conjunction with technology to change human meaning-making and valuing. Preferable futures require a return to considerations of human nature and conditioning, and how the two interact to influence behavior and thus the experience of being human. These human-making dynamics are an unavoidable part of the consequences that flow from all innovations. As we have developed incredible new capacities, our history of naive and now nihilistic design has driven civilization into a massively complicated bottleneck of existential consequence. Existing ecologies of technologies and infrastructures must be judged by their effects on bodies, minds, families, cultures, and the environment. Future technologies must be designed according to methods that take human value and experience seriously enough to be constrained by their limits‚Äîsuch as sanity, dignity, and justice. The dangerous reign of nihilistic design must end if our civilization is not to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbth7dyht46vsjz5hgnys8t))
