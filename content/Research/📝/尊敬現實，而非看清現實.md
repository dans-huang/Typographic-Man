Q：我們常說人要「看清現實」，你覺得這是個好的建議嗎？

A：我認為這是個有用的建議，但不是個完整的建議。

首先，我們得試著瞭解「現實」究竟是什麼——讓我盡可能用最日常、你我最能夠直接經驗的方式解釋這個字，而遠離哲學或宗教的管轄範圍。在那之後，我會試著提供一些我們日常生活中對於「現實」可以秉持的觀點。

當我們說「看清現實」，我們所指的「現實」通常是這樣的東西：現在進行式的、無法或難以改變的、外在的限制條件。它可能是指你老闆的機歪性格、前女友已經移情別戀的事實、父親病入膏肓的肺癌病情，也可能涵蓋了更大的範圍，比如政府雷厲風行的政策、新冠疫情下的全球局勢、或是演化心理學使你領悟的兩性動態。

當我們用這種方式討論「現實」時，我們往往是受限、無法盡如己意、必須另行出路的。

Respect for a person is to interact with who you believe the person 'could be', not who the person 'is'



Firstly, you never really get to know a person 100%, thus it's not okay to assume you know what 'reality' is. You don't fully know a person 100%, nor do you know the 'reality', so don't assume you've take it into account

Secondly, the respect you pay a person is not based on who he/she is, but what you expect out of him/her. It's not to say you should based your interaction with people on who you expect them to be, even though it's quite often the case, be it negative or positive.

A better way to put it is that, you don't interact with what the person is, but what the person could be. Even though it's gonna base on partially your expectation, but it can also be based on what the 'ideal self' that person can be.

Think your interaction with a kid. Often times we don't necessarily interact with a kid in the way that we really see what he/she is, rather we interact with who we believe he/she can become. It's not possible to shy away from your own expectation of a kid, but at the same time, it's safe to assume that you know what's 'more than who he/she currently is', and so does everyone else around.

We interact with a kid in this way. We put a universal expectation and encouragement around the kid, so he/she continues to act 'more' and grow. We don't interfere with the interaction by seeing that he/she is not at a certain level that it's not enough for us to continue any communication.

This is quite precisely why teenagers often feel not respected by adults, because adults act in a way that tells them 'you're only what you are - a teenager' while they want to be viewed as 'more than who they currently are'. They know fully well that they're not yet adults, yet giving them such respect and the corresponding personal responsibility is one of the best way to cultivate their characters and forge them into real adults.

When we see who a person 'really is', it's useful to ask yourself if you've lost 'faith' in this 'reality'. You need to understand that every 'better future' is emerged from a 'not-that-good-yet now', and every person's 'better/ideal self' is emerged from the person he/she is today. It's fairly easy to lose faith in humanity when you simply 'see reality as it is' yet don't fully understand that the current reality is precisely what gives birth to a better future. Same with any person, regardless whether you think so or not, because as stated, you don't fully know the person, nor his/her potential.

Don't assume you know reality well enough that you can look down on it. Give each person - essentially a facet of the reality - his/her proper respect, by treating him/her as who they could be, not who they currently are.

The same goes with yourself. Instead of going with what others expect from you (which is very useful as well), you should also put the same self-respect and expectation-for-more onto yourself. Living up to others expectation is great, but living up to your own expectation for yourself and in turn alter what others expect from you, is often times more fulfilling. Don't assume you know yourself well enough to look down on your potential for good and greatness.

When we pay such respect to all facets of reality that we encounter - including each others and ourselves - we're doing the very work to transform each present moment into a better future, by transforming each person into a better version of themselves, including us.

Respect for the reality isn't mere optimism, it's really viewing each moment and each grain of current status as something so divine, that something better will manifest if you put in the work to transform it, or at least, in the process you'll transform yourself. It's not just thinking something good might come out of the current reality, it's knowing that something good in the future will only come out of the current reality if you cultivate it. Do your work, and respect the moment.
