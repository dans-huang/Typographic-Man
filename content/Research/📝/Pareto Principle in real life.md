Meritocracy & Education


Meritocracy isn't working: people in 1940 will most definitely become wealthier than their parents, but not anymore for those born in the 1980s.

In the 50-60s, people get richer altogether. Not anymore. The majority of middle classes are not getting much better, but the 'super rich' is getting way ahead.

The richer are also way better at remaining on the higher social class, as they have access to better education and opportunities. This severely tilts the balance of the society and leaves education and meritocracy dysfunctional.

Technology

Big companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc, simply get stronger and more unmovable when more people use their products. They can really feed off of their growing sizes. The more people use their products/services, the easier for them to have control over people's lives and neglect governmental warnings.

They're the big sharks, with many fishes trying to leach on to them to get some profit, but when they feel like doing so, they can slay the small fishes (by coming out with the same product/service, like AirTag) since they simply dominate the discography.

Finance


The taking over of passive investing (index funds) is essentially betraying the very essence of capitalist market and investing. Companies like Vanguard (the BigThree) consist of up to 20-30% of the total hold of companies from S&P500.

Since the 70s, investors are more and more favoring the (not-so-passive) passive investing and index funds to secure their financial future, as it really does offer a promising future by having great return and low fees, all while requiring no hard work from the investor. By giving the money to companies like Vanguard, they can save all the researching and hard work of 'real investing' and simply eat their 'free lunch', while these index funds are actually active but mindless investing machines that simply make the big companies bigger by pouring more money into them to simply 'track the index'.

Index fund should work amazingly when most people are not using it, but now we're at a point that the fact that index funds consist of the majority of investing activities is essentially hurting the market and the US economy, since most people are not even paying attention to news and knowledges about investing and the companies they invest in. This also really hurts all the smaller companies as they will not likely to get shared the pie since less and less active investors are in the market searching for the undervalued companies.

"In a world with exclusively passive investors, capital will get allocated only to the big companies and not necessarily to good, promising, or efficient companies. A gravitational, big-getting-bigger effect would dominate stock-price movements."

"The problem is not just the indexers. It is the public markets they reflect, where more chaos, more speculation, more risk, more innovation, and more competition are desperately needed."
