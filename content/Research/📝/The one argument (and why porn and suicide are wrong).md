The sovereignty of individual is the deepest truth I can currently conceive of and can't reason any deeper. I almost have to take a leap of faith and believe that each one of use is made in the image of God, as it sets the very fundamental for our sovereign existence.

To be valued both by ourselves and by others, is an undeniable instinct we all share and the basis of how we conduct our lives. We like to live as if we're something of value and we like it when others validate that ideas, and others will find us respectful only when we treat them the same way.

Free will or not, we as humans like to live as if we're conscious agency of our being. We certainly don't like to be devalued as if we're merely objects or means to an end, that's when we'll feel used, taken advantage of, lied to, and betrayed.

Almost universally, the ideal life we can possibly imagine for ourselves consists of something involving appreciation and care from our family, validation and recognition for our work, cherishment and love from our partners, and affirmation and respect for ourselves. This is the very instinct we live of, and the ideal we live towards.

So it's undeniable that one of, if not the very thing we want in our life, is to be valued as a human being, in whatever way we individually desire. Being valued as an individual can give us tremendous meaning and help us get through significant amount of hardships, which is why the voluntarily adoption of responsibility is one of the quickest way to cultivate drive and meaning for your life.

This is why in our daily life, we should not only view ourselves as individuals as values and not accept ourselves to be used (to be enslaved by other's emotions or actions), but should also be wary not to reduce any person's individuality down to his/her look, race, gender, opinion, action, and belief. As tempting as it is to do so, by fighting this lazy and irresponsible attempt to reduce people into less than who they are and dehumanize them, we form a much stronger basis for public discussion, social affair, mutual understanding, genuine and trustful interaction on all levels. This is a moral pillar for a strong and stable society.

So this leads us to why watching porn is wrong - and I'm mainly talking about the act of watching people have sex for one's own pleasure - is because this act is equivalent to exploiting the performers for one's own usage and reduces them to merely objects for certain means. Watching porn is not wrong because sex and body are sinful, but this the very act we should avoid as it's wrong in and of itself, whether or not the performer likes it or if it's hurting anyone.

透過色情片來理解自身性偏好及性生活的人，會深深地內化「一切都是以我為中心」的訊息，無論看色情片的人怎麼做都沒辦法改變這點。而當他們找到可能成為他們人生伴侶的人時，他們會缺乏正確的觀念去建立起真正的人際關係。- [[Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World]]

And so there's no more dangerous idea than what some people might think 'humans as parasites on earth'. Such view might come from the care for the environment as well as the pessimistic view for humanity, but it's nonetheless a catastrophic idea. Such idea is not only not helpful (should we just line people up and shoot them? tell people to quit having children?), but itself degrades the value of the person promoting it, which is why it's catastrophic - it's an idea that can bring demise to the very person withholding it. And that's precisely what many mass shooter did - when one REALLY believes there to be no value in humanity and its existence, the most logical act would be to kill as many people as possible before one commit suicide

That leads us to suicide. Imagine the ideal life we talked about where your value is appreciated, now consider the opposite direction, where a person is totally not valued. Despite there're many other complex reasons why people lead to suicidal thoughts,

...The very suicide attempt is the doing (direct result) of the circumstances in which the person is not valued, so the only real self-conscious decision in the midst of it would be to stand up and live as if you're a valuable individual. Do not let the whole self destructing circumstance consume you into nothingness, which is what the darkness of this world can sometimes do to people.

Key foundation that pro-life arguments are based on: Value of a living being (human) is based on the potential (human-ness) that one possesses, not on whether one can express that fully at a given moment.

The same can be said to those with brain damage (or even brain dead) or seriously ill. People will do what they can to hold on to these loved ones in the hope of them being well again - to realize the potential of being a human in this world again. It seems somewhat illogical or cruel to disregard that part of a embryo just because it hasn’t have the chance to prove its capacity of human-ness and establish a relationship with anyone, yet.

However, how do we determine which potential is greater? The mother’s potential without carrying this unwanted child, or the potential of both of them living, or even the potential of the child at the expense of sacrificing the mother’s life if needed? In different period of the human history we seemed to have different answers, and I’m not so sure how to answer this one at this moment, and I’m quite certain this answer is unanswerable.

For the most part I’d still suppot a society with minimal interference of people‘s live from the government and I do not trust governments for achieving greater goods for most citizens (as I do believe in the sovereignty of individual‘s choices) and I do want to stay away from authoritarian regime of most kinds. I’d still propose a free, libertarianism socieity with minimal interference from the governments but with high moral standards of the people - having the shared sense of responsibility of the people goes hand-in-hand with the optimized freedom.
