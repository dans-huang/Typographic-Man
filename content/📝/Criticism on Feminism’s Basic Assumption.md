Judging from the podcast I heard from professor Anne Phillips:

Feminism deems the world as a power game ultimately. They criticize the fact that those in power are mostly men and that’s the oppressing patriarchy against women.

This logic doesn’t hold true due to a couple reasons:

1. You can’t even properly defined what this arbitrary “power” is. What kind of power? Political power? Economical power? Physical power? Psychological power? Is it the power your boss have over you? Or does it also count when one person is more likely to follow another one’s opinion in their relationship?

Essentially, feminism is playing this game with such degree of ambiguity that it’s almost impossible to tell the exact kind of power they’re actually opposed to, instead they’re just pointing fingers at things they simply don’t like to see without really giving it a proper definition.

正因為我們身處的「價值場域」是以極其複雜的方式、耗費漫長歲月才得以演進至今——縱連中國皇帝也未必能一意孤行地推翻前朝、乃至千百年累積的傳統典範——所以若將這一切歸因於「權力」或更廣義的「力量(Power)」、用輕率的二分法將人類劃分成壓迫和受壓迫者，那只是顯露了一個人對歷史的無知。更別說，許多人根本是打著「政治正確」的正義旗幟、實行著部落主義和獵巫行動。

一條魚若要批評池水污濁，得先認知到水是牠賴以生存的必要條件；如果牠輕蔑地以為自己不用水也能活得好好的，那實是對現實抱持了最根本的不敬。

二戰至今，世界由啟蒙運動所開啟的現代主義思維，走進了對科學、理性、文化、體制等社會根基進行反省的後現代。人類開始思考自身存在之於整個地球的意義、開始收斂四百年來因科學進步而累積的過份自信、開始透過不同的意識形態去檢討社會民族之間的鬥爭角力。也於是，對於生態環境、弱勢族群、社會正義、全球化等議題的關切與著力逐漸在國際間萌芽。

時間快轉到二十一世紀，佔據主流媒體的已普遍是自由派、甚至進步主義的聲音。在逐漸左傾的年輕世代（[相關閱讀](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010850061)）裡，社會結構越來越理所當然地被理解成「權力鬥爭」下的產物，無論鬥爭的主體是種族、宗教、階級、或性別（性向）。當「部分人壓迫其他人」的故事被輕易認定為人類歷史的縮影，社會議題就幾乎必須是某種「公平正義」問題——即使絕大多數的問題都絕非只是「壞人欺負好人」這麼單純。

台灣，在獨特的歷史背景（中國傳統的帝制思維和政府遷台後的黨政記憶）和西方思潮的積極攝取（進步主義、女性主義、美國媒體和娛樂產業）之下，無論是貼著「傳統」或「先進」標籤的不同世代的人，都可以在「部分人壓迫其他人」的照樣照句裡找到自己認同的敘事：惡霸財團對農工的侵害、父權主義對女性的壓迫、有錢人對平民的操弄、獨裁政府（無論是否真的滿足這個詞的定義）對人民的欺侮……

只要你有心，你總是可以替自己找到「我站在好人這一邊」、甚至「我其實是個受害者」的證據。

Q：這樣想有什麼問題嗎？

A：讓我先嚴謹且慎重地表示，我既不是要一竿子打翻所有的左派主張，更非對社會上的苦難與不義視若無睹。世界上的確存在許多受害者需要援助、社會中的確仍有許多問題需要修正，更別說，不幸的事也可能降臨在我身上。但在此同時，輕易將社會視為「權力鬥爭」的戰場、進以把自己看作「好人對抗壞人」故事裡正義（或受害）的一方，實是一件極其無知又自負的事情——就我的觀察，這正是許多先進國家社會正逐漸傾倒的方向。

即便在動物社會裡，純粹的「力量」也從未是安身立命的長久之計：黑猩猩族群中的[Alpha Male](https://www.ted.com/talks/frans_de_waal_the_surprising_science_of_alpha_males)——一個近年被廣為濫／誤用的字眼——事實上往往是特別關心婦孺、樂於分享的仁君，而那些利用暴力和恐懼來統治的黑猩猩領袖，不僅得長期活在被推翻的焦慮裡（人類歷史上的暴君也多有此煩惱），更可能要實際承受[遭眾人變節且懷恨凌虐的下場](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/chimpanzees-chimp-tyrant-eat-cannibal-tyrannical-leader-propos-nothing-a7557916.html)。

「力量」在人類社群中是個更加不管用的社會基礎。如果你觀察小孩在遊樂場上的互動，你會發現那些愛欺負別人的小霸王通常都不是最受冷落的對象，他們有敵人也有朋友；真正最不受歡迎的反而是那些有社交障礙的孩子。然而欺凌他人來換取注意力的行為，在國中就會開始顯得乏力，高中之後便是個挺糟的策略。

(見[[道德的動物學基礎]])

你我在成長過程中往往都會很自然地發現，懂得信任、合作、互惠是可以讓你在多數日子裡過得最順利的方式。我們學會配合他人、信任彼此；我今天替你出力、並相信你明天會為我做同樣的事；我們不需要將雙方施受的恩惠記在紙上供日後算帳，因為我們對彼此的為人和情誼抱持信心，不擔心會被辜負——這就是良好人際關係的最實際詮釋。

在感情或婚姻關係中亦是如此：兩個人相互關心、為彼此付出，並假設對方也會為自己做一樣的事。如果你認為你的感情關係是建立在權力的鬥爭上，或如果你相信某些網路上的「兩性專家」會告訴你的「願意轉身離去的人擁有比較高的價值」，你可能會認為自己需要站在這段關係裡的上風、藉此讓對方滿足你的要求，但這麼做只會讓你成為感情中的暴君、而另一個人成為奴隸——這不會是你想要對待自己和你所愛之人的方式，它只會引領這段感情走上腐蝕心靈的死路。

2. Feminist view undermines the very value of individuals that are not in power (even in this arbitrary sense) and in a way downplays their role in the history of mankind.

Consider the social structure of chimpanzees and bonobos, or the equivalents in human society: one patriarchal and the other matriarchal. Is the fact that one puts one gender in power for leadership and stable social structure, downplays the importance of another gender and essentially diminishes its value and contribution to the society?

Obviously, any gender, or any particular person doesn’t need to be in “power” to be deemed worthy and beneficial to the society, nor should any person be deemed less valuable only because the lack of “power”. It’d be foolish to think anyone that’s not in power is lesser than the ones who do, or as if those who lack in power are dispensable while those in power can maintain their importance.

Society is founded on many other pillars than mere power, thus to think one needs to be in power to prove his/her relevance is really to devalue the masses who do not, as well as oneself that isn’t yet in power. Feminism’s point of view essentially isn’t empowering women but downplaying this role in the history of mankind and evaluating their sovereign value by portraying them as victims.

I’d suggest that we promote the very sovereignty of individuals as that’s the true foundation of our society. Every single person can matter as long as they strive to actively participate in the society, be it with power or not. There’re simply too many ways to contribute to the society and its just more right, more noble, and more useful to encourage a person to aim at the highest good one can manage. It might be the CEO of a huge corporation, or a housewife with 2 kids. They’re all important and the society needs every single one of us to strive for the goods we can create in this earth, not by any arbitrary standard or ideology, but by what we can conceive of as our calling.



3. If one really think it through, one can see that the feminist logic isn’t really complaining about patriarchal society, but instead the very essence of competence.

Those in power, even if they are mostly men, are still a very minority of people. While on the other hand of the spectrum, those in prisons, working dangerous jobs, or homeless, are mostly consist of men as well. If the oppressing patriarchy really is systematic oppression against women, then those living the most terrible lives would be women and not men.

So if feminism really sees what they’re truly against, they’ll realize they’re not against patriarchy, but any form of inequality produced by the very nature of competence.

As long as some people can do valuable things better than others, which will inevitably happen if we value one thing over the other in our society, it’ll produce inequality or outcome. If that leads to certain group of people having more power and that becomes a problem, than feminism is clearly blind to the fact that this inequality of competence is also essentially how capitalism produce wealth for all people and help create the thriving society we now enjoy.

But consider the alternative: communism has already shows how it can bring equality of outcome by bringing most people into poverty, while it still doesn’t solve the power problem and might even worsen it by putting the power into even smaller group of people’s hands.

Novel prize winning economist Milton Friedman thus said "Any society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither. On the other hand, a society that puts freedom first will, as a happy byproduct, end up with both greater freedom and greater equality”.

And once again, that essentially tells us why it’s a better idea to promote individual sovereignty and give people the freedom to live their lives fully without any judgement from both the society’s standard or ideology. We might find more happy housewives as we no longer tell them to be ashamed about their choices, or we might find more female CEOs of the largest companies committed to their career. Or we might find that we’re not too far from the ideal after all, but now without no judgements and victimhood. Maybe the world where it’s truly equal is the place where people can live happily with all the inequality but no one is playing victims for any specific group identity. Maybe the world feminists should want is the world in which it’s no longer needed.
