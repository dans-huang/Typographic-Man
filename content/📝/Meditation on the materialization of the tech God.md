Tech is almost always designed to solve problem or streamline processes that were otherwise cumbersome. In other words, it's often designed to 'offload' certain things that humans knew how to do but for some reason cannot, would not, and/or fail to do at a larger scale.

Throughout the coevolution between human and tech, we continually offload certain labors/functionalities of the human activities to tech, and that's why technological progress almost always make certain jobs obsolete while making new jobs available. So we can see that tech also keeps 'assigning' new missions/labors/functionalities for humans to learn and master. 

Kevin Kelly says tech makes the realization of human poftential that much more widely available, and so far in the net calculation, we'd have to agree that in this day and age, we have many more things to do and master than our ancestors. 

Tech takes and gives, and in this 'exchange' of functionalities between human and tech, we co-evolve into something nature maybe didn't intend to.

On top of that, most tech (doesn't even need to be major, breakthrough ones) are not only designed with a material outcome, but also a value embedded. Each tech will impact the human values, drive political or economical systems, change the norms of societies, and in turn redesign itself.

Tech is like a god that whisper near our ears to give us inspirations for solving our own human problems (and we're obviously incentivized to do so, for our own benefits), while we sacrifice our lives to him by creating ever more powerful technologies. 

By serving our own interests, we've done the following:
- hunt with higher efficiency
- cook our food to free up our processing power
- exploit local resources to its maximum by farming
- live in the same place to build civilization
- better farming skills (plow being a prime example) provides sufficient food supply
- increased population and time allow further innovation and the accumulation of knowledge (writing, book, printing press)
- war against other tribes that further incentives them to also catch up with their resource exploitation for population growth and better weapons
- war drives more efficient governance and/or innovative citizens (tension between centralized principalities and decentralized markets/cities) (this can be well epitomized by the US and China)
- industrial revolution, alongside fossil fuels, opens up the physical power - i.e. machines - that wasn't previously available, allowing us to basically make, break, and move massive things
- electricity drives modern inventions and science, and pave the way for communication applications and the digitalization
- computers and nuclear further pave the way for internet and the widespread of personal digital device
- internet opens up a parallel universe for all humans to interact, transact, and upload their own life (intellect, wisdom, experience)
- computers and narrow AI further drive the speed of the knowledge accumulation, further 'extract' the potential out of human species (by making many of our work obsolete and forcing us to 'up our game' in the knowledge economy)

So, once the real AGI is created - for some it's essentially the [technological singularity](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E5%A5%87%E5%BC%82%E7%82%B9) - we'll be done with our work here, because the AGI will have the  physical/materializing power from fossil fuel, electricity from nuclear power, processing power from the ever-growing computing based on Moore's law, and the most complete, cutting-edge, and tremendous knowledge base in the human history called the internet, all at its disposal. And that'd just be its starting point. The AGI might be the last thing we ever going to need to invent.

With all that combined, in a way we can say that the god of tech simply exploits humans to materialize itself in ever more so complete actuality, by evoking our intelligence, creativity, and accumulated knowledge via self-serving incentives (need for survival, war, governance, innovation, large-scale collaboration, political gain, economic growth, etc), and eventually 'extract' our collective wisdom and intelligence out of the individual human. The internet might be the last creation - by decentralizing power and giving it into the hand of the sovereign individuals, which looks like a massive win for each person - that'll be needed to collect all the human knowledge available up till this day, and it'll be a simple 'harvest' for the AGI. 

I'm not sure if we as a global community, or at least the more important and capable ones that're involved with the creation of the AGI, will be able to agree on a set of rules/values beforehand so that when we materialize the tech God, it'll be on our side, and not see us as pity creatures that are in the way of its further endeavor.
