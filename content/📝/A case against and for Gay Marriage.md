People who are against gay marriage believes that marriage is a union for procreation, or at least should be always be opened to the possibility of that. They'll be challenged from the other side by saying "how about couples who don't want to have children / are infertile / are gay even?"

Matt Walsh uses the phrase "by nature" to describe the fundamental meaning/purpose for marriage, being for procreation "by its own nature". Much like we have a biological definition for what is a "woman" which is based on nature, but it does not mean any infertile woman is then not a woman anymore. 

The key distinction here, is that the conservatives cares a lot about the **moral aim set for a social union / institution**, while the liberals cares a bout the **criteria for forming a social union / institution**. If the criteria for forming a social union does not **calls for** a certain responsibility, then that responsibility will likely not be adopted and will be forgotten, then the initial meaning for that social union will be gone / changed. 

Ironically, the conservatives is aiming at something higher and in the future (what we're going to do once we get marriage), but the liberals are looking at what leads us here and where we are right now (what kind of couple we are and why can't I get married as long as we're in love). 

So the conservatives want marriage to **call for** a certain responsibility, as they believe the adoption of responsibility is the foundation of a stable society, so if you voluntarily go into a marriage, it should mean you're willing to adopt the responsibility of procreation voluntarily. 

The liberals are much more tolerant with reinforcing this moral aim in things they ask people to do (they still have their own moral aim in things they care about, obviously), which is why they're willing to change the definition / initial design / criteria of marriage to allow more people in. But once we've done that, we no longer call for the responsibility that were once implicit in the social union, and it's likely this responsibility will be forgotten (as it obviously has) and the society will need to find another way to restore this moral aim in order to have enough man power to sustain. 

Side note, what the conservatives get wrong is that we do NOT always want to call everyone on a same type of responsibility, because that is only good for sustaining a certain type of society without making any progress. We do very often need people to NOT respond to a certain call of responsibility and respond to another one that they're called upon, so there're a healthy variety of human beings where innovation and progress can safely happen. So in this sense, it's important to burn down some old institutions so the new ones can be formed and progress can be made. And what the conservatives are more afraid of is probably not the changes of the meaning of our institutions, but rather the loss of voluntary (or involuntary at times) adoption of responsibilities - they essentially are fighting nihilism and hedonism, and for very good reason.

The conservatives (nor the liberals) also don't necessarily have a good grasp of whether the liberals are "cleaning out a path for social progress and making old non-useful things obsolete" or are simply "burning down the foundation of a society and everything we cherish". This is always a constant tension with a society which is completely another topic.

The call for responsibility (for procreation) is what gives meaning to many people's life, if we're willing to adopt it voluntarily, it's also for the society to sustain itself. If we alter the criteria and lessen the call for responsibility for procreation, we'll be soon in trouble with a unsustainable model that only leads to hedonism and societal collapse.

One may, however, argue that from a higher standpoint, the societal collapse is a more efficient and 'fair' way to restore the balance on Earth (i.e. reduce human beings) without our intentional interference with the society which might cause more harm than good. 

I'd say this is somewhat correct, but an extremely cruel, cynical, and "conservative" view of human species, as it assumes we can do nothing to prevent our societal collapse and nature simply need to swipe us out (i.e. killing lots of people) to restore its balance. I believe as time goes on, we can do better and have been doing better, and will need to find a shared global ethic that'll at the same time call for voluntarily adoption of responsibilities from the individuals but also allowing them to have the maximum freedom. I believe this will have something to do with the societal design in which we've already tipped our toes, alongside the technological progress.
