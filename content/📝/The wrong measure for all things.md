(How our lives in the 20-21st century can possibly be viewed as a total mistake/detour from the right direction in later centuries when people look back with their re-gained moral knowledge and holistic worldview.) 

- Technological thinking
  ref: [[Daniel Schmachtenberger - Bend Not Break Part 1 Energy Blindness]]
	People are overly optimistic about technology being able to solve pretty much all the problems we face, in fact technology creates just as many - if not more - problems than it solves.
	
	People are too optimistic about technology for a good reason - technology has indeed been immensely improving for the past few decades, however that's merely based on the fact that we discovered the carbon pulse that fuels pretty much all the globalized technological advancement.
	
	However, being this optimistic about technology really only serves as a placebo, as it seems there's no other way around many of the economical and environmental issue we face, unless all of us voluntarily / involuntarily downsize/de-grow our economy and lifestyle, which is certainly not considered an option for those who already enjoy the technological brilliance they have in their daily lives. It's simply too hard to let go, so instead they just put their faith in tech for solving the issue and sustaining our current lifestyle.
	
	Our latest technological advancements have mostly been dopamine-driving machines that fuels our desires for more tech itself, instead of substantial effort in resolving the issue at hand. It is also clear that our recent technological advancements have not been very efficient in uniting humans as a global community and helping us see the bigger picture for the challenges we face, instead it's been extremely efficient at dividing us by feeding our tribalism by stimulating our emotional reactions - all of which is driven by the wrong metrics that our current economic model uses for measuring success.




- Reductionist/Atheistic thinking
> ref: [[Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein - Evolution and the Modern World]]

- Economical/Capitalistic thinking
  > ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q23wwyksdY&t=1687s

	The meaning of things is measured by their economical output. 
	
	This blinds people from seeing what's truly important, when those things are just self-evidently important in common sense.
		This is how people neglect environmental preservation, work ethics, corporate's social responsibility, labor force issues, people's wellbeing, etc.
		Hence the lack of acknowledgement from the liberals on the importance of motherhood, which is clearly a productive and immensely important job. I believe they only neglect motherhood's crucial importance because they're blinded by the economical glance that distorts what truly matters.
		
	Economical thinking can drive ideologies and industries that simply don't work as first principles (e.g. Hippocratic Oath - "Do no harm"), rather it only satisfies large corporate and industry's economical gains. 
		This is basically how the whole modern-day pharmaceutical industry works.
		It also drives governmental intervention for the market which creates just as many  - if not more - problems than it solves, only to achieve a certain GDP growth to satisfy the voters.
		Economical thinking essentially drive the shortsightedness of the globalized consumerism culture and democracy, shortening people's time preference.
	
	Economical thinking is basically an extension of what Fromm's called people being "marketing personality". We basically just get ourselves "marketized" for another 50 years after Fromm's warning and have many things distorted and wrongly prioritized by the economical glance.


- Nihilistic/Moral-less thinking
  >[[理想主義者欠缺的謙卑]] [[「樂觀虛無主義」的謬誤]]
  
	People's belief that essentially nothing matters and morality isn't something to stress about and to be worked on as humans.
	
	People have now even feared of using "moral languages" to avoid sounding harsh, judgmental, or conservative. 
		
	The lack of moral aim is the direct result of human's globalized pursuit of technology advancement and economic growth. We became self-deceived and arrogant by our huge advancement in science and technology which in turn, enables us to rule the world SO much that we happily rendered our traditions, religions, and moral views outdated and useless.
	
	A virtuous aim for human ideal, has proven to be more useful than mere scientific reductionism worldview and economic-driven technological advancement. We've lost our meaning for living in the shortsighted pursuit of expediency and technological/scientific utopianism.
