Stock market: moral in winning & losing. Despite the short term investing being a rough zero sum game, there’s still no real winning and losing behind each decision. One’s earnings could be a loss in certain perspective, one’s losing could be a win in another perspective. You simply don’t know why one buys or sells, so it’s impossible to determine the win and loss for others. Thus it’s impossible to answer the question whether an earnings is moral or not.

Adding the company’s earnings and works into the equation, 2 people can invest at the same time and earn the same amount, while one spent lots of time researching but the other was simply following others blindly. You can argue maybe one person deserves the earnings more than the other, but essentially it’s impossible to determine the answer.

This is to hold each person accountable for his/her decision in the market. One is responsible for his decision in his investing and no one is capable of judging his economical behavior other than himself. Essentially the only win or loss is determined by the person.

Same is applied in politics. We hold each person accountable for his decision in voting and everyone has the same vote, despite the difference in how they’re informed and educated and how much they’ve researched. We gave up the position to judge others decisions on any given topic only so we can make sure the capable people can have their voices heard, and in turn things can be bettered in turn of that. The individual freedom and free market creates this frame where one can affect the world in a positive way with maximum space and flexibility. This is the pillar of modern society.

Essentially we need to accept that there’s no one answer for everyone if we want to enjoy the fruit of such belief manifesting in our society. We have to accept the fact that everyone can have the freedom to pursue their own answer and truth in their own way without anyone interfering. And the faith in that, in turn of everyone pursuing their own truth (instead of any supervisor assigning the tasks to them), we can make the society thrive.

So it’s not a proper way to view this world anymore in that we think there’s already an answer for everyone (totalatism, traditional religions, right wind conservatives don’t gel with this world view very well), or thinking one group of people have the answer for all (Marxism, post modernist, left wing). Instead we have to understand that people should be viewed as sovereign individuals so we can exploit the talent in people. However it’s also not proper to view the world that everyone can have this own answer and everything is relative, as nilhism is not helpful for the society to gain consensus and move toward an united direction.
