[[理想是生命意義的前提]]

---
「理想」的存在=Jesus as a symbolism for the human ideal:

First consider it as purely a myth: An ideal human being (it makes sense that he’s the son of God/king of all kingdoms) comes down to earth in order to spread love and God’s words, guide humans through our live’s catastrophies. Ended up being shamed, punished, tortured, ridiculed and crucified. On the cross he didn’t ask his father for help nor punishment on the pity humans, instead he asked for mercy and forgiveness as they did not know what they were doing.

So when we consider this from a purely mythical point of view: A highest form of ideal human is love and forgiveness for all ignorance, malevolence, and sins that’s inherit in all of us. And Christianity is human‘s 2000-year effort in institutionizing this relationship between the human ideal and us, manifested in all asepcts of Western civilization.

And if this story is not meaningful enough to inspire you to look deep into your conscience and form an ideal for you to aim your life at, in order to manifest the deeper meaning of your existance, then maybe now let us consider the possibility of the Christian stories being true historical events. I believe it‘s safe to consider this to be the pinnacle of the monomyth.
