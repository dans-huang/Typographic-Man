- Worship of a subjective, undefined, conflicting ideal of 'nature'
	- **He thinks we should 'take care of' our body by adopting an optimized 'natural' lifestyle (but failed to mention what that 'natural' lifestyle really looks like, and why it's not like stone age human species), but also should seek medical assistance (when he agrees it's better) and avoid medical assistance (when he disagree because it's 'unnatural') both at the same time.**
	- On one hand, we should do the correct things (which we only know largely because of the cumulation of knowledge and science) to prolong our life and health, but on the other hand, he agrees there're too many humans so some probably will have to die. 
	- Sheltered by the completely safe, abundant, convenient urban life free from diseaces and hunger, he failed to see that what humans do to prolong our life is largely through technologies  and (the cumulation of) knowledges that are completely NOT natural (unless one attemps to argue against that point), because **nature is actually absolutely brutal and hostile to our lives.**
	- The '**perfectly natural state of things**', where people just live in harmony with nature, and **already and always** know how to treat themselves (their bodies) and each other without doing anything 'unnatural' and stupid, but still die (for some legit yet unknown reason) in the most 'natural' manner possible, is a completely delusional dream only existing in his undefined, subjective belief of the good of 'nature'.
	- On the other hand, he also believes that there're too many humans on this earth (as we're sort of a cancer to the planet) and animals in the zoo are being treated cruelly. This distorted view of the 'perfect nature vs malevolent human' is entirely based on his distaste of human beings. He doesn't see humans as a force of good, but mostly an evil creature often destined for corruption and greed. However his pride leads him to believe only the people he deemed as 'good' (including himself) are the ones worth living, and the others can die without even his tiniest shred of mercy and compassion.

- Failure to understand the multipolar trap
	- People's virtue wavers based on the condition, as pathetic as it sounds (I don't think so though, I only think that it means the design of the game rules we play by is much more important than we normally think).
	- Personal virtue cannot solve the problem of corruption, when afterall you actually need to apply the same standard of personal virtue across the whole human species.
	- People will do what they're going to do, as long as the system incentivize the abandonment of virtues in the pursuit of ideological victory or financial reward or else. The corruption of human mind is not just the failure of personal virtue, but also the failure of designing/operating a system that rewards/incentivizes good behavior.

- Pride
	- His north star for good and evil essentially goes back to himself, thus he cannot appreciate God, the way things are, and the things that he should not credit himself for (like good luck).
