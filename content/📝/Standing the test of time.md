Lindy effect

Rationality is survival - Nassim Taleb

Virtue (alongside religious teaching) helps human survive and thrive across time. Virtue is human's tool to beat our innate time preference. Virtue has to stand the test of time and apply across one's lifespan and generations. Real virtue applies across time and helps men survive.

This is why the right to tell the truth (free speech) is crucial to men's survival. Lies allow one to get away with trouble and manipulate reality, but reality will always win. Telling truthful and useful words is ultimately a better strategy to live in a long term and a better idealt to aim for.

The same applies to consumer goods and design. This is where Dieter Rams come in.
Out of his 10 principles for good desing: "Good design makes the product useful", "Good design is unobtrusive", "Good design makes a product understandable", "Good design is honest", "Good design is long-lasting", "Good design is environmentally-friendly", "Good design is as little design as possible", many of them accentuate the importance of being useful, truthful, long-lasting, sustainability, and humility. 

In search of good designs that stand the test of time, you understand how modern consumerism has changed people's focus for living a virtous life by principles that stand the test of time, instead now we're encouraged to get the newest fanciest thing that uses shocking design language and gimicks to get people to pay for something they don't want nor need.

Sustainability as a virtue should not focus on minimizing our impact on the environment, but establishing a lifestyle and moral living that allow us to live and flourish on this planet for as long as possible. We are not the cancer to the earth and our existence is not meaningless. We are moral animals and all have the capability of living a virtuous life, if we figure the system out and set our aim right.

# Some thoughts after reading [[We Wrestle Not With Flesh and Blood, but Against Powers and Principalities]]

- The concept of Lindy has it's utility, not because what has survived for a long time will be granted a some longer lifespan, but becuase in our effort of understanding the "WHY" of certain things standing the test of time - the principles, the philosophy, the thinking behind, and when and why it knows what old things to abandon and what new things to adapt - we can more safely and reasonably predict what will also work in the future when technological changes happen.
- Take books for example. 
  First we should humbly assume we do not understand the old texts that've survived the history of vast/multiple technological changes (such changes being the most important), and do our best to interpret it in the way that make sense both in present days and the past. We should not blindly assume it'll survive the NEXT technological revolution, but dig in to its **principles for survival** to determine if it'll still survive the next tech change. 
  If a book - be it 2000, 20, or 2 years old - contains knowledge that can be reasonably interpreted and implemented across time, or, can reasonably explain / be used to explain things that happened then and are happening now, we can safely assume it must has grasped some fundamental thinking that will probably continue being useful for explaining the things that're about to happen with the succeeding technological changes. On the contrary, if a newer book suggest the latest things to be good only according to its current face value and does not explain the principles behind the thinking well enough to also explain the things that come before that, it's probably not worth reading because the methodology did not set out to stand the test of time.
  So this is the reason an old book that's still be printed today should be carefully and humbly read and understood, but without blindly believing it must be applicable for the next upcoming era - it probably might (more so than most other books released this year), but we can never be sure.
- We can also look at it from a software-update/technological-advancement point of view. 
  We should very careful in identifying the **features** and the **principles** in work in our current time and in the past. It's also crucial to understand how **hardware**, ie state of technology, suspends/prolongs/disables/enables the **software**, ie trending cultural/political/ethical (even) believes, and even updates it or creates new ones.
  So instead of being completely reactionary, thinking that traditional values/ethics/politcs (ie good ol' days) is better, or even fighting to bring it back (which is probably a universal nostalgia at best), we should strive to think about, pinpoint, and communicate the working principle/philosophy that underly the given time and space (state of technology) and try to extract the principles from the features, so when the next technological advancement comes, we'll have the working principles that allow us to design and promote the new / updated features that'll work in the next state of technology, instead of holding on to the old feature that simply will not work in the next era.
  So in a real software sense it's like, we should strive to understand why Windows 3.11 works (and works very well) given the state of technology, the design principles behind the its features and functionalities, what it was maximizing/optimizing for / oriented toward, and WHY it might or might not still matter for the next version of Windows. With such understanding, can we safely, knowingly, and confidently move forward to the next version, knowing (not full well, but well enough) how to navigate with the latest state of technology like the advancement of face recognition, AI, wireless connection, touch screens, etc, and orient ourselves toward the right goal so it's totally okay for us to abandon the older OS for the newer, better (in some sense), more suitable (for our state of techology) one.
