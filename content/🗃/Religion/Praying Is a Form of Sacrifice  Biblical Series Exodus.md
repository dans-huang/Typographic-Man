- work is a form of sacrifice and vice versa and that because you sacrifice the present to the Future at least but you also sacrifice everything to your highest priority if you're not confused and then that brings up the question of what the highest priority should be and what the quality of the sacrifice should be and the answer to that psychologically is it should be the highest possible quality sacrifice to the highest possible thing because you otherwise you have to ask yourself why would you bother doing it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbx9dgjd6szm8wgmqknta04))
- if your conscience is functioning well basically what it does is indicate to you constantly that your sacrifices are either not of the right sort or they're not of the highest quality and you call yourself out on that ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbxccj9fd9ykpz024pe930p))
- if you try to escape from that it just makes it worse for you and you know that and you really can't escape from it not except by abiding by it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbxd0g70dh7wacmjr5qa989))
- if the prayer is proper is you're saying there's part of me that needs to go there's part of me that needs I need to let go there's part of me that needs to die and it has to begiven up to something higher what part of it is of me has to go and that's there's a contemplative aspect to that and you look to the highest to help guide you in that so there's a discriminating Spirit within you that can help separate the chaff from the wheat and the offering up of the chaff
  is the sacrificial gesture and so that can be transformed into prayer ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbxk7fb5abvade653gkm9ax))
- one of the things that Jung would say about that for example is that if you if you give up enough psychologically you don't have to you you'll you'll cut your losses in actuality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grbxkk19k8j80mcw8ptehv01))
