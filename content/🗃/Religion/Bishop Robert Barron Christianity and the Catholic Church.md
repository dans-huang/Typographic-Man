- > 神是存在的，神是存在的行為，是自身的存在 01: 另一種說法是，在阿奎那，神是現實中獨一無二的，本質和存在是一致的，神就是存在，這些都是談論我們所說的神的方式，它們有點像吟誦，這是故意的，我們談論神的方式幾乎有一種禪宗的氣質，我在說一些實質性的東西，但它更像是一種消極的模式，更像是神不是什麼，因為世界上沒有任何東西可以與這些描述相對應
  god is Ipsum Esse Subsistens god is the subsistent act of to be itself 01:00another way to state that in aquinas is god is that reality unique absolutely unique in which essence and existence coincide to be god is to be to be those are all ways of talking about what we mean by god they are kind of gnomic and that's on purpose there's almost a zen koan kind of quality about the way we talk about god i'm saying something that's substantive but it's more in like a via negative mode it's more like what god is not because there's nothing in the world 01:30that would correspond to those descriptions ([Time 0:00:53](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e003bbf85fb100096dafba))

- > 說上帝的本質和存在是一致的，就是說上帝的本質是存在，而這不可能是世界上任何偶然事物的真實情況，所以我在那裡做的是，我在用傳統的方式向上帝示意，使用的語言同時也是哲學上的精確和天真。 你知道，這兩者都很準確 是真的，上帝的本質和存在是一致的 上帝是什麼，和上帝的主動存在是一樣的 但是現在這意味著什麼呢？ 我不太清楚，因為我們的普通經驗中沒有任何東西與之對應 我們的經驗中的一切是某種類型的存在
  to say in god essence and existence coincide is to say god's very nature is to be and that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world so what i'm doing there is i'm i'm gesturing the way the tradition does toward god using language that's at the same time philosophically precise and gnomic you 02:30know it's both accurate it's true god essence and existence coincide what god is is the same as god's uh active to be but now what does that mean i'm not quite sure because nothing in our ordinary experience corresponds to that everything in our experience is is a being of some type so it's existence received according to the mode of some essence that's not true of god which is why you can't be found in the world ([Time 0:02:12](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e3628e3e82450009869efe))
- > 我們的知識總是從這個世界開始，從普通的經驗開始 但我認為我們可以通過形而上學的分析 通過哲學推理得出一些關於現實的知識 它超越了我們的經驗 所以我們向它示意 我一直喜歡阿奎那，他說我們使用的關於上帝的語言是類比的，所以它不是，不是單一的意思 我說的那個東西，你知道，或者關於這個瓶子，我可以說關於上帝 不，這讓上帝成為一個實體，同時它不是簡單的等價交換 所以如果我說那個東西是和上帝是，我是指完全不同的東西，不，我指的是類似的東西，所以神就是存在，所以存在的真正含義是神的存在，那個東西或這個東西的存在，或者星系或亞原子粒子的存在都與神的存在方式類似，所以在這個基礎上，我可以做一些陳述，我可以理論化，甚至在你建議的極限，我可以想象，所以我們有神的隱喻，聖經中充滿了這些權利 上帝是一塊石頭 你知道上帝就像一頭獅子 上帝就像這樣那樣 或者聖經有時會把上帝想象成一個人走來走去 你知道現在只有粗糙的原教旨主義會說 這是對上帝的普遍準確的描述 這是一個形象，抓住了上帝的存在方式的一些東西
  our knowledge begins always in this world begins in ordinary experience 04:00but i think we can through metaphysical analysis through philosophical reasoning can come to some knowledge of a reality which is transcendent to our experience so we gesture toward it i always like aquinas who says the language about god that we use is analogical so it's not it's not univocal meaning what i say about that you know can or about this bottle i can say about god no that makes god an entity at the same time it's not simply equivocal so if i say well that thing is and god is i mean 04:30totally different things no no i mean something analogous so to be god is to be to be so the real meaning of being is the being of god the being of that thing or this thing or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles would be analogous to god's manner of being so on that basis i can make some statements i can i can theorize and even at the limit as you suggest i can visualize so we have metaphors for god and 05:00the bible is replete with those rights god is a rock uh you know god's like a lion god's like this and that or the bible will sometimes imagine god as a as a human being walking around you know now only the crude fundamentalism would say well that's a universal accurate description of god it's an image that's catching something of god's manner of being ([Time 0:03:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e362f9c879dd00096fbe9e))
- > 我喜歡恩典的語言，上帝的行動是第一位的，所以如果我完全呆在我的領域裡，用我的鷹眼和我的探究精神去尋找，我就不會找到上帝，我可能會找到一條開闢的道路，但我想說，最後上帝找到了我，我想那時信仰的語言就開始更有意義了。
  i like the language of grace god's action comes first so if i stay perfectly within the realm of i'm seeking with my kind of eagle eyes and 06:00my inquiring mind i'm not going to find god that way i i might find a path that opens up but i would say finally god finds me and i think then the language of faith begins to make more sense ([Time 0:05:49](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e3632c3e82450009869eff))
- > 真正的信仰是超越理性的黑暗，在理性的遠方，它是超級非理性的，而不是非理性的，這是一個非常重要的舉動，在我能知道的極限，在我努力和我的視野的極限，有這樣的地平線打開，我想這是真的，即使在普通的認識方式，也有一種地平線，引誘我們超越我所擁有的，信仰更多的是與那種黑暗有關，而不是理性之前的黑暗。
  authentic faith is is the darkness beyond reason and on the far side of reason it's it's super irrational not infrarational and that's a very important move at the limit of what i can know at the 07:00limit of my striving and my vision there's this horizon that opens up and i think that's true even in ordinary ways of knowing there's a kind of a horizon that lures us beyond what i've got faith has to do more with that kind of darkness rather than a darkness prior to reason ([Time 0:06:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e363553e82450009869f00))
- > 成為上帝就是如此 我不是這個也不是那個 我不是向上也不是向下 我不是在這裡也不是在那裡 上帝是那個中心無處不在、周身無處不在的人 就像神秘主義者所說的那樣 現在我可以對它有一個清晰明確的概念了嗎 沒有，在某種程度上這就是重點 
  to be god is to be so i'm not this or that i'm not up or down i'm not here or there god is that whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere as as the mystics put it now can i get a clear and distinct idea of that no and in a way that's the whole point ([Time 0:08:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e363bc3e82450009869f01))
- > 上帝的基本理念是對世界的非競爭性的超越
  the basic idea of god is non-competitively transcendent to the world ([Time 0:10:46](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e364133e82450009869f02))
- > 無神論者的類別錯誤在某種程度上是我在尋找上帝，他是這個故事中的一個角色，而不是他是這個故事的作者，神秘地存在於故事的每一個方面，但不是故事中的一個角色。
  the category mistake of the atheist in a way is i'm looking for god he's a character in this story somewhere no he's the author of the story mysteriously present to every aspect of the story but not a character in it ([Time 0:11:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e3644d3e82450009869f03))
- > 奧古斯丁說，上帝同時也是在時間上的Intima Mayo，在優越的Sumo Mayo，他離我比我離自己還近，同時他比我能想象到的任何東西都要高，因為他一旦得到洞察力，即上帝是純粹的主動存在，當然這是真的，所以現在上帝正在維持我們的存在，真正的阿奎那說，上帝在所有事物中的本質是存在和力量，而且是最親密的，他不在這個房間裡，好吧，上帝在哪裡，他不在這個房間裡，他完全在。 恐怖的是，我們說他完全是另一個人 但一旦你破解了這個密碼，我想你就會明白為什麼那是真的 我現在明白了，我正從更多的哲學語言轉向更多的神秘語言 因為所有的神秘主義者都是這樣說話的 關於上帝的可用性和不可用性的高級悖論
  augustine says god is simultaneously in timier intima mayo at superior sumo mayo he's closer to me than i am to myself 12:30and he's higher than anything i could possibly imagine at the same time because he once you get the the insight that god is is the sheer active to be well of course that's true so right now god is sustaining us in existence true aquinas says god is in all things by essence presence and power and most intimately so and and he's nowhere in this room okay where's god he's nowhere in this room he's totally 13:00terribly terror we say he's totally other same time but once you crack that code though i think you see it of like why that would be true i see now i'm getting from more philosophical language to more mystical language because all the mystics talk that way in these high paradoxes about god's availability and unavailability ([Time 0:12:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e364813e82450009869f04))
- > 是什麼讓基督教變得與眾不同呢？"上帝成為我們中的一員 "這一極其怪異的說法，上帝成為被造物，但並沒有停止其作為上帝的身份，而且。 他成為了我們在燃燒的灌木叢中看到的那個原則，這個原則是全面的，所以上帝越接近我，我就越有光彩，但現在把它提升到了極致，這就是我們所說的道成肉身，上帝之子的道成肉身以這樣一種方式使人類變得光彩和美麗，這是基督教的支柱，就是道成肉身，你知道的，隨之而來的是對所有現實的救贖，所以不僅僅是人類的救贖，而是在成為生物的過程中，上帝將世界神化，你知道希臘教父總是說，上帝成為人類，人類可以成為上帝，這是個很好的總結，我認為基督教的本質。
  what makes christianity distinct this supremely weird claim that god becomes one of us god becomes a creature but without ceasing to be god and 15:30without overwhelming the integrity of the creature he becomes what we see in the burning bush that principle which obtains across the board so the closer god comes to me the more radiant i become right but take that now to the nth degree would be what we mean by the incarnation the incarnation of the son of god becoming a creature in such a way as to make humanity radiant and beautiful that's the pillar of christianity it's the incarnation you know um 16:00and what follows from that is the redemption of of all of reality so not just of human beings but in becoming a creature god divinizes the world you know the greek fathers always said god became human that humans might become god and that's a good way to sum up i think the essence of christianity ([Time 0:15:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36525940eab00097328c3))
- > 如果上帝變成了人，那就意味著人類有一種尊嚴，它超越了任何人文主義者的任何說法，對嗎？ 古代中世紀的現代基督教是可以想象的最偉大的人文主義，上帝成為我們中的一員，以便將我們妖魔化，我生命的目標不僅僅是成為一個好人，不僅僅是成為18歲。 我的人生目標不只是成為一個好人 不只是成為社會的一員 我的人生目標是成為神性的參與者 所以我不認為有比這更偉大的人文主義 即使是可以想象的 所以這就是我認為人文主義被化身深刻影響的地方
  if god becomes human that means there's a dignity to humanity which goes beyond anything any humanist of any stripe has ever said right ancient medieval modern contemporary christianity is the greatest humanism imaginable god became one of us in order to demonize us the the goal of my life is not just to be a good person not just to be 18:00you know materially successful not just to be um a member of society the goal of my life is to become a participant in the divine nature and so there i don't think there is a humanism greater than that even conceivably so that's where i think humanism is profoundly influenced by the incarnation ([Time 0:17:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e365ad940eab00097328c4))
- > 驕傲是最致命的罪過，很容易看出為什麼驕傲是奧古斯丁所說的incravats，並說我在自己周圍像黑洞一樣凹陷下去。
  pride is the 20:30deadliest of deadly sins and it's very simple to see why pride is the augustine calls it incravats and say i'm caved in around myself like a black hole ([Time 0:20:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e368b66ed37e00099ae452))
- > 衡量標準是愛，對嗎？愛不是一種感覺，而是一種意志的行為，要把對方的利益放在心上，這就是Aquinas，要把對方的利益放在心上，看，這就是反黑洞原則。
  the metric is love right and love is not a feeling it's an act of the will to will the good of the other that's 30:00aquinas again to will the good of the other as other and see that's the anti-black hole principle ([Time 0:29:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36a59940eab00097328c8))
- > 如果我願意你是好的，因為這對我有好處，所以你知道我參加這個項目對你有好處，我想我願意你是好的，但那是因為這對我有好處，這只是一種間接的利己主義，這就是為什麼我認為愛是非常罕見和奇怪的，我真的想要對你有好處，因為其他人。 所以不與我自己的驕傲的自我的黑洞傾向相聯繫當我打破了這一點，我已經忘記了自我，我已經進入了對你有好處的空間這就是愛。
  if i'm willing you're good because it's good for me so uh again you know it's good for you that i'm on this program i guess i'm willing you're good but that's cause it's gonna be down to my benefit right that's just an indirect egotism that's why i see love is really rare and strange that i really want what's good for you as other 30:30so not connected to the black hole tendency of my own prideful ego when i've broken that i've forgotten self and i've moved into the space of your own good that's what love ([Time 0:30:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36a7d940eab00097328c9))
- > 教會的意義在於把我們嫁接到基督身上，使我們越來越符合愛的要求，但你知道最後的計算，我會把它留給上帝，我的意思是，但用愛作為衡量標準，在一天結束時，當你檢查你的良心，我今天是否願意為別人的利益，我在這方面的效果如何，就像伊尼亞特-洛約拉一樣，殘酷地誠實，或者我只是願意別人的利益，因為這對我有好處。
  the point of the church is to graft us 31:00onto christ that we might become more and more conformed to love but you know the final calculus i'll leave that to god i mean like but but use love as the metric at the end of the day when you examine your conscience did i will the good of the other today how how effective was i at that and be just like ignatia loyola be brutally honest or was i just willing someone's good because it was good for me ([Time 0:30:59](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36b0d48a9f80009e01608))
- > 聖人伊裡奈是我最偉大的英雄之一，他的名言是："上帝的榮耀是一個完全活著的人。"這讓我們擺脫了對非法主義的迷戀，以及我做得夠不夠好的問題，上帝希望我們完全活著。
  saint irenaeus is one of my great heroes ancient you know patristic figure and his famous line is gloria day homo vivens right the glory of god is a human being fully alive see and that gets us over this sort of obsession with illegalism and did i do enough and is that that's a big enough sin and god wants us fully alive the key to that 32:00is willing the good of the other he he died that we might come to a richer appropriation of that ([Time 0:31:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36b4848a9f80009e01609))
- > 愛總是與善的順序相關，因為如果我願意為對方的利益著想，我就必須知道那是什麼東西 對，所以一個父母說，哦，給孩子她想要的任何東西 ，那不是愛，那是放縱，那是多愁善感 但我必須知道那是什麼東西，如果我為你願意的話
  love is always correlated to the order of the good because if i'm willing the good of the other i have to know what that good is right yeah so a parent that says oh give the kid whatever she wants 33:30well that's not love that's that's indulgence or that's sentimentality but i have to know what the goods really are if i'm going to will them for you ([Time 0:33:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36ba72e03c3000941c3c6))
- > 教皇的目的是象徵、體現和吸引整個教會的團結，所以他是教會團結的個人象徵，主教是教區團結的個人象徵，教區的牧師是教區團結的個人象徵，所以他理解的不是組織上的團結，而是有機的團結，就像什麼。 如果你沒有那個統一的形象，社區就會變得很容易，你會看到，如果沒有教區長，我們會說，它更具有象徵性和有機性，而不是組織性。
  the purpose of the pope is to symbolize and embody and draw together the unity of the entire church so he's the personal symbol of the unity of the church who's a bishop the bishop is the personal symbol of the unity of a diocese who's a pastor of a parish he's the personal symbol of the unity of that parish so he understood it not so much organizationally as organically again it was like what 41:30that around which the pattern organizes itself and if you don't have that that unifying figure the community will kind of facilitate and you see that all the time without headship we would say so it's more symbolic and organic than it is um organizational ([Time 0:41:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36cf548a9f80009e0160a))
- > 我們不能從世俗的角度來理解上帝的眷顧，我認為上帝的眷顧是：我是否被更深的愛所喚醒，那麼我就知道我在尋找上帝的眷顧。
  we can't read you know god's favor in worldly terms i would say god's favor is am i awakened to deeper love then i know that i'm finding god's favor ([Time 0:45:01](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e36da748a9f80009e0160b))

- > 我們怎麼會有資格說，哦，不，沒有任何可能的好處，即使是你知道的每一個陀思妥耶夫斯基和斯蒂芬-弗萊所能想到的最大的邪惡，我們怎麼能傲慢地說，我知道沒有任何好處可以產生，我知道沒有任何道德上合理的理由，上帝會允許這樣做，因為我認為這是傲慢到極點的說法，這就是上帝可以允許邪惡帶來更大好處這一說法的假設。
  how are we ever in a position to say oh no there's no possible good that would ever come from that even the greatest evil that you know every dostoevsky and that can conjure up and stephen fry still how could we have the arrogance to say i know there's no good that could ever come from that i know there's no morally justifiable reason why god would ever permit that because i think that's hubris to the nth degree for us to say that and that's the assumption behind this claim that god can permit evil to bring about a greater good ([Time 1:01:22](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5ea44862fc30009a8f019))
- > 我記得我在想，這是對我們與上帝的一個很好的比喻，就是這裡有一個無限愛的上帝，他一直和我們在一起，我們說你在做什麼，你為什麼不把這個從我身上拿走，我的意思是最終的答案是信任我，信任我，向我投降。
  i remember thinking it's a great metaphor for us vis-a-vis god is here's god infinitely loving god who's with us all the time and we say what are you doing why aren't you taking this away from me and the answer i mean ultimately is trust trust me trust me surrender to me ([Time 1:03:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5ea81d8b0a500099a93cc))

  there's all kinds of other rational warrants for god and so i i know that god exists i know that god is infinite love and now i got to square that with this experience and the way i do that is by a trusting confidence that god knows what he's about you know again i know how how inadequate that always seems to anyone who's suffering including myself when i'm in great suffering but i think that's the best that we've done in the great tradition ([Time 1:05:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5f25ea544d90009c827df))
- > 我們可以通過自然原因來解釋一切嗎？ 為什麼你要援引一個超越世界上各種原因的原因呢？ 所以我試圖解釋，比如說阿奎那的運動因果關係，你知道最終性，我可以用自然原因來解釋，這不就足夠了嗎？ 所以我覺得，當自然主義者說話的時候，或者是那些純粹的唯物主義者，他們就會說，不，那是完全足夠的，對現實的科學解釋是完全足夠的。所以我會偷著樂，說好吧，告訴我為什麼我們需要更多的東西。 要做到這一點，你必須走出柏拉圖的洞穴，在我看來，因為我對自然主義的反對意見是，它是停留在立即可觀察到的經驗領域，犯了一個錯誤，說這就是存在的全部，這就是需要解釋的全部，而在我們進入宗教之前，就停留在柏拉圖，走出洞穴的第一步。如果你現在把它和線的寓言結合起來，就是數學對象 我和那些說數學是對非物質的體驗的人一樣，我已經走出了一個單純的經驗性的物理自然主義世界 當我理解一個純粹的數字或純粹的方程式或純粹的數學關係時，它將在任何可能的世界中獲得，而不與空間和時間相聯繫 這就是走出洞穴的第一步。這導致了更多形而上學的反思 例如對自然界的反思 我是說，我可以把這個東西作為一個物理對象來談 我可以在各種層面上分析它 跟著所有的科學家 你知道的，在這個東西上上下下，很好 但是我仍然在柏拉圖的洞穴裡 我仍然在看墻上閃爍的圖像 但是當我走出洞穴，進入數學領域 我就進入了一個不同的存在境界
  can we just explain everything through natural causes why would you have to invoke a cause beyond the causes in the world so as i'm trying to explain let's say for aquinas motion causality you know finality can i just do that with natural causes wouldn't that suffice to explain it so i i get like when naturalists are speaking or people that are pure materialists they'll just say no that's perfectly adequate a scientific account of reality is utterly adequate to our experience um so i would steal man that and say well show me why we need something more and to do that you got to get out of plato's cave it seems to me because that my objection to naturalism is it it's staying within the realm of the immediately empirically observable and making the mistake of saying that's all there is to being that's all there is that needs to be explained and long before we get to religion just stay with plato the first step out of the cave if you combine it now with the parable of the line is mathematical objects and and i'm with those the many people that would say mathematics is an experience of the immaterial i've stepped out of a merely empirical physical naturalistic world the minute i understand a pure number or a pure equation or a pure mathematical relationship which would obtain in any possible world which are not tied to space and time that's the first step out of the cave and then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections for example on the nature being i mean so i could i could talk about this thing as a physical object and i can analyze it at all kinds of levels and follow all the scientists you know up and down through this thing and fine fine but i'm still in plato's cave i'm still looking at the flickering images on the wall but when i step out of that into the mathematical realm i have entered a different realm of being seems to me ([Time 1:07:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5f359898d380009fd5c98))

  scientism is rampant today with especially young people the reduction of all knowledge to the scientific form of knowledge and i i'm a vehement opponent of that there are dimensions of being that are not capturable through a scientific method of mere observation hypothesis formation experimentation etc as great as that is as wonderful as that is but it's still i think within plato's cave and that's not to say it's not real it's just at a relatively low level of reality ([Time 1:10:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5f58d898d380009fd5c99))

  i just came across it recently and discovered this whole literature around it is eugene vigner's article in 1960 called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics to the physical sciences i think that's the title of it or effectiveness or something like that yeah but what's so cool is you know he's not a religious man he was a kind of a secular jew but yet he uses the word miracle like eight times in that article and because he just is so impressed by the fact that high complex mathematics describes so accurately the physical world and can be used to to create things and to manipulate and why should that be true that there's something very weirdly mysterious about that relationship you know and i would say it's because you you stepped into a higher order of being which is inclusive of a lower level of being that's the platonic approach is that as you move now i'm going to different metaphor you move to higher levels they're inclusive of the lower levels ([Time 1:10:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5f5bfa544d90009c827e0))

  one of the arguments for god is based on the intelligibility of the world this very it's like vigner it's very peculiar fact it seems to me that the world is so radically intelligible why should that be true why should it be the case that being has this intelligible structure to it so it corresponds to an acquiring mind so aquinas can say that the the intelligible enact is the intellect and act meaning there's some there's some deep correspondence between this and that and it's i'm with vigner that's i think really weird and unreasonable and strange now my answer is because the the creator of the universe is a great mind and uh has stamped the world with intelligibility uh in the beginning was the word right and the word was with god and all things came to be through the word don't we shouldn't picture that so much it's a it's gesturing in this very powerful direction there's an intelligence that has imbued the world with intelligibility and and we discover that ([Time 1:13:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5f64ca544d90009c827e1))
- > 西方物理科學的可能性的條件是一個基本的基督教思想 即世界不是上帝 所以我可以分析它 在它上面做實驗 我可以不把它神化 我不與世界有神秘的關係 它不是上帝 但第二它是絕對的 在每個角落都是可理解的 這兩個概念與創造的概念相關，所以它是被創造出來的，它不是上帝之外的上帝，但它的每一個維度都被上帝的思想所觸及。 當這兩件事都到位了，科學也就開始進行了。
  the condition for the possibility of the of the western physical sciences was a basically christian idea namely that the world is not god therefore i can i can analyze it experiment upon it i can i don't divinize it i don't have a mystical relationship to the world it's not god but secondly that it's it's absolutely in every nook and cranny intelligible and those two ideas are correlated to the idea of creation so it's been created it's not god's other than god but yet it's touched in every dimension by god's mind and when those two things are in place the sciences get underway you know i don't worship the world anymore but i'm also utterly confident i can come to know it and those are theological ideas ([Time 1:14:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e5f69ca544d90009c827e2))

  the very fact we use a word like universe to me is very interesting even if you say multiple universes to me that it's like well they're they're whatever this the whole is the totality universem turned toward the one um why would we call it that why would why wouldn't we just call it an aggregate it's just an aggregate of stuff it's an aggregate of all but we call it a universe and my answer from the classical metaphysical tradition is it's the intuition of being ([Time 1:16:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e67475e316c90009efa5f6))
- > 我想說我們稱它為宇宙是因為它轉向了存在的那一個 這是一種直覺，無論從誇克到星系再到其他什麼，給我一億個其他的宇宙，它們仍然是存在的 對，它轉向了存在的那一個，把我們的經驗結合起來 所以現在我在形而上學的分析層面上 所以現在我處於形而上的分析層面 我用柏拉圖的語言說，我現在處於形式層面，超越了數學層面的形式，而形式又包含了數學，數學又包含了物理，我想這就是尤金-維格納，數學包含了物理，它在形而上是先於物理的。
  i would say we call it a universe because it's turned toward the one of being it's this intuition that whatever from quarks to galaxies to whatever give me a billion other universes they it would still be existence right it's turned toward the one that being unites our experience and so now i'm at the metaphysical level of analysis i've taken another step out of the cave in plato's language i'm at the formal level now beyond mathematics level forms and and the formal is inclusive of the mathematical which is inclusive of the physical and i think that's eugene vigner is that the mathematical includes the physical it it is metaphysically prior to it ([Time 1:17:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e674ced8c8e4000930a145))
- > 我讀過他的書，也和他聊過，我覺得他對耶穌的看法有點像康德，我的意思是，對康德來說，耶穌並不是歷史上的耶穌，這個很久以前的人物，而是作為道德生活的原型的耶穌，他說他是一個完全討上帝喜歡的人的形象，所以耶穌居住在我們的道德想象中，作為一種啟發，作為一種我們趨向的目標。
  as i read him and talk to him i think he's kind of at a kantian level in regard to jesus what i mean there is for kant jesus it's not so much the historical jesus this figure from long ago it's jesus as an archetype of the moral life you know he says he's the image of the person perfectly pleasing to god and so jesus inhabits our kind of moral imagination as a as a heuristic as a as a a goal that we're tending toward ([Time 1:19:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e6755f5588110009054727))
- > 我一直覺得神話表達和新約之間的區別在於它讀到了像卡爾-瓊和受他影響的約瑟夫-坎貝爾這樣的人，還有現在的喬丹-皮特森，他們都非常聯合，對經文進行了這種典型的解讀，我是說我認為這非常有趣。有很多事情要做，但有一種平靜的感覺，比如說，是的，有趣的，在這個文化和那個文化中，它是道德生活的形式，我理解所有這些，然後你讀新約，不管那些人在談論什麼，他們不是在抓住 他們不是抓住你的肩膀，搖晃你來吸引你的注意力，告訴你發生在他們身上的事情，對嗎？ 就像復活，關於神的死亡和復活的神話，以及那是多麼強大的力量，塑造了我們的意識，這很吸引人，這不是新約，新約是你聽說過嗎？上帝讓他從死裡復活，500人看到了他，彼得也看到了他，最後我也看到了他，這就是保羅的說法，不是獨立的。
  it always strikes me the difference between let's say mythic expressions and the new testament is it read someone like you know carl jung and then joseph campbell whom he influenced and now jordan peterson was very union and this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures and great i mean i think it's very interesting and there's a lot going on there there's a sort of calmness though about it like yeah the interesting and that's in this culture and that culture and it's the form of the moral life and i understand all that then you read the new testament uh whatever those people are talking about it's not that they are grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking you to get your attention to tell you about something that happened to them right like the resurrection the myth of the dying and rising god and how powerful that is and shaping our consciousness that's fascinating that's not the new testament the testament is did you hear did you jesus of nazareth whom they put to death god raised him from the dead and he was seen by 500 and he was seen by by peter and and and then lastly i saw him that's how paul talks it's not the detached you know um psychologist amusing on archetypal things and i think that makes a huge difference when it comes to christianity ([Time 1:21:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e6761c5588110009054728))
- > 歷史細節的強度在這裡是至關重要的，所以如果你知道，如果你看希特勒和納粹德國，僅僅說權力腐敗是不夠的，有時，看希特勒的原型，更重要的是看他如何上台的細節，更有力量。是的，他在世界範圍內作惡的方式是什麼 然後你就可以對人性的複雜性進行激烈的鬥爭 權力對制度的影響，以及所有這些東西 所以聖經的歷史性 我們是歷史性的宗教，我們一直是這樣，這很重要
  the intensity of the historical details are essential here so if you you know if you look at hitler and nazi germany it's not enough to say well power corrupts and sometimes so looking at the archetype of hitler it's much much more important much more powerful to look at the details of how he came to power yeah what are the ways he did evil onto the world and then then you can get really intense about your struggle with some of the complexities of human nature and power on institutions and all that kind of stuff so the historical nature of the bible we're in historical religion and we've been it's important ([Time 1:22:41](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e6763d5588110009054729))
- > 我認為了解聖經的最好方法是把它看成一個圖書館，而不是一本書，所以它是一個書籍的集合體，來自不同的時期，不同的作者，不同的讀者，不同的體裁，所以在聖經中你可以找到詩歌，找到歌曲，找到類似於歷史的東西，不是我們意義上的歷史，而是類似於福音，是他自己的體裁。你會發現福音書，這是他自己的體裁 你會發現像保羅那樣的書信文學 你會發現世界末日的東西 聖經裡有這麼多東西 那麼聖經是不是真的是上帝的話語呢？
  i think the best way to get at the bible is to think of it as a library not a book so it's a collection of books right from a wide variety of periods different authors different audiences and different genre so in the bible you find poetry you find song you find something like history not in our sense but something like history you find gospel it's his own genre you find uh epistolary literature like paul you find apocalyptic there's all this in the bible so is the bible literally the word of god it's like saying is the library uh literally true it depends on what section you're in ([Time 1:23:43](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e67670558811000905472a))

- > 還有一件事我覺得很有趣，那就是平等 因為在古典哲學中，柏拉圖-亞裡士多德-西塞羅的政治哲學 對他們來說不是平等，而是我們的不平等，這很有趣 柏拉圖把我們分為三個階層 亞裡士多德說只有一小部分有財產的男性和受過足夠教育的人 亞裡士多德說只有一小部分有財產的、受過充分教育的男性 才應該參與政治生活 其餘的都應該參與私人生活 有些人適合做奴隸 所以他把我們大大地劃分開來 西塞羅也是如此 這是從哪裡來的這種奇怪的想法，我們都是平等的 我想這是什麼呢？ 我想在這個小詞中特別體現了殘餘的東西 所有人都是平等的 這就是我們的平等 我們都是上帝的孩子 所以把上帝排除在外 我想我們會迅速滑向不平等的懷抱 現在在古典世界是的，但他看看20世紀 我的意思是，當上帝被系統地排除在外時 我想你會看到權利和平等被瘋狂地中止 所以我認為上帝在畫面中是非常重要的 我們是上帝下的國家，這非常重要 這不是虔誠的廢話，而是我們民主的理性基礎
  the other thing i find really interesting is equality because um look in classical philosophy political philosophy plato aristotle cicero it's not equality for them it's our inequality that's really interesting so plato divides us into these three classes and aristotle says only a tiny little coterie of property males of sufficient education should be in the political life the rest should all be in private life you know and then some are suited for slavery so i mean he divides us dramatically same with cicero and so on um where does this come from this weird idea that we're all equal i mean how we're not equal in beauty not equal in strength we're not equal in moral attainment we're not equal in intelligence so what is it and i think the residue especially comes through in that little word that all men are created equal that's our equality that we're all equally children of god so take god out of the picture i think we are going to slide rapidly into an embrace of inequality now in the classical world yes but heck look at the 20th century i mean when god is excluded in a very systematic way i think you saw the suspension of rights and the suspension of equality like mad so i think it's very important that god is in the picture and that we're a nation under god it matters enormously that's not pious boilerplate that's at the at the rational foundations of our democracy ([Time 1:27:36](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e67744558811000905472b))
- > 20世紀的極權主義大多來自於對上帝的質疑，以及對上帝在公共生活中的否定，所以我對這一點表示同情 當我們超越了善與惡，你知道的，剩下的只是權力的意志，那麼為什麼我們會驚訝於強者的崛起，他們為自己的目的少用權力，當我們忘記了平等和權利這樣的想法，這些都是以上帝為基礎的，為什麼我們會驚訝於死亡營的出現，所以我認為這之間肯定有關聯。
  much of the totalitarianism of the 20th century follows from that um that questioning of god and the dismissal of god from from public life so i i would be sympathetic with that um when we're beyond good and evil you know and all that's left is the will to power and then why are we surprised that the powerful rise and that they use the power less for their purposes when we forget ideas like equality and rights which are grounded in god why are we surprised that that death camps follow so i think there's a correlation there for sure ([Time 1:29:35](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e6777e558811000905472c))
- > 現代科學從其狹隘性中獲得了力量，我的意思是，他們幾乎完全包圍了亞裡士多德意義上的形式和最終因果關係，他們專注於有效和物質因果關係，正如我所說的，這給予了巨大的力量，但來自於焦點的狹隘性，但對亞裡士多德來說，更重要的原因是最終和形式原因，所以最終因果關係吸引了我們
  the modern sciences drew their strength from their narrowness and what i mean there is is they almost completely bracketed formal and final causality in the aristotelian sense and they focused on efficient and material causality and that gave as i say great strength but from the narrowness of focus but for aristotle the more important causes are the final and the formal causes and so final causality there what's drawing us ([Time 1:31:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/62e00311abc4d2000903dced?annotationId=62e677e5e316c90009efa5f7))
