## Highlights
- > voting in an election is a skill, not a random intuition. And like any skill, it needs to be taught systematically to people. Letting the citizenry vote without an education is as irresponsible as putting them in charge of a trireme sailing to Samos in a storm.

- > He did, however, insist that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply should be let near a vote. We have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by birthright. We have given the vote to all without connecting it to wisdom. And Socrates knew exactly where that would lead: to a system the Greeks feared above all, demagoguery.

As a result, we have elected many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors. ([TimeÂ 0:03:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/639b068b2b30e00008df1d1d?annotationId=639b0806a41af400083358ef))
