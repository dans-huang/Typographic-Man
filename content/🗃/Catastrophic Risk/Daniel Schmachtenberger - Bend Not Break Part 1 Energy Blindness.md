- > 文化人類學家馬爾文-哈里斯的作品被稱為文化唯物主義，他認為所有歷史上的人類文化都有一些共同點，它們有一個上層建築，即意識形態、信仰、記憶和文化所講述的故事。 所以你和我都同意，在未來的幾十年裡，我們必須解決所有這三個問題，我們必須把它們放在一起。
  the work of cultural anthropologist marvin harris called cultural materialism he frames all historical human cultures have something in common they have a superstructure which is the uh ideologies the beliefs the memes the stories that the culture tells in the middle is the structure which is the institutions and the rules and the laws and the economic system but underpinning it all is the infrastructure which is the energy and 08:30the throughput and the waste streams and how the system functions and so you and i both agree that what's coming in the coming decades is we're going to have to solve all three of those we're going to have to move them together ([Time 0:08:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e4b0c83dd6000937ea44))
- > 所以能量是自然界的基本要素 能量是自然系統中的生命貨幣 生物體和生態系統圍繞著任何能量的捕獲進行自我組織，就會有進化的優勢 如果你沒有多餘的能量，作為動物，你就不能繁殖，不能有 錯過，不能有 homeostasis和一切 所以能量回報與作為熱量追求的能量投入之比在自然界是巨大的驅動力，這也適用於人類系統 
  so energy is fundamental to nature energy is the currency of life in natural systems organisms and ecosystems that self-organize around any energy capture have an evolutionary advantage if you don't have surplus energy as an animal you can't reproduce and and have uh misses and have uh um 11:00homeostasis and everything so the ratio of energy return to the energy invested as caloric pursuit in nature the huge driver and that also applies to human systems ([Time 0:10:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e4e3a5d5070009ec3f06))
- > 自19世紀以來，我們一直在消耗這個能源電池，它是以石油、煤炭和天然氣的形式儲存的碳和碳氫化合物，比它在地球深處的光合作用的日常涓流充電快1000萬倍，我們的經濟體系把它當作是利息，而它實際上是我們的原則。
  since the 1800s or so we have been drawing down this energy battery which is the stored carbon and hydrocarbons in the form of oil coal and natural gas 10 million times faster than it was 13:00sequestered uh by the daily trickle charge of photosynthesis in the deep past of earth and our economic system is treating this as if it were interest when it actually is our principle ([Time 0:12:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e50ec83dd6000937f7e2))
- > 國民生產總值不能與能源脫鉤，因為它是衡量我們燃燒多少東西的標準，它是商品和服務，需要能源來提煉、提供、維護和處理地球上的每個產品。
  gdp is cannot decouple from energy because it's a measure 15:00of uh how much stuff we burn it's goods and services and there's energy that is required to refine uh deliver maintain run and dispose of every product on earth ([Time 0:14:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e5428f5340000922693a))
- > 我們作為個人，作為家庭，作為小型企業，作為公司，作為民族國家，我們都在努力使金融盈餘貨幣利潤最大化，而這些利潤與能源息息相關，與碳氫化合物息息相關，我們不能停止或放緩，因為這個系統需要增長來繼續，來償還過去的金融債權，所以我們所做的是通過各種規則的改變來踢開罐子，比如債務等等。 我們必須繼續增長，但增長是與能源聯繫在一起的，而我們現在繼續這樣做的唯一方法是中央銀行和政府吹大他們的資產負債表，以保持商品和服務流向大量人口，所以發生了什麼，是市場或比人類個人更高層次的系統的向下因果關係嗯，對我們的行為施加了16:30的規則，這是我們無法控制的，所以我們事實上是人類現在是作為一個能源饑餓的超級生物體在運作。
  we as uh individuals as families as small 15:30businesses as corporations as as nation states we are trying to maximize financial surplus money profits which are tethered to energy which are tethered to hydrocarbons and we can't stop or slow down because the system requires growth to continue and to pay off the financial claims from the past and so what we're doing is we're kicking the can with various rule changes uh with debt etc 16:00and we have to continue to grow but the growth is tethered to energy and the only way that we're continuing this right now is by central banks and governments blowing up their balance sheets in order to keep goods and services flowing to large populations so what has happened is the market or the downward causation of a higher level system than than human individuals um is imposing 16:30rules on our behavior that are out of our control and so we are de facto the human species right now is functioning as an energy hungry super organism ([Time 0:15:25](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e5718f5340000922693b))
- > 生命最深刻的定義之一實際上是一個熵泵，它可以從環境中獲取更多的能量，並將其熵值外部化。 所以你在看人類技術的方式，從石器開始，然後是農業技術，然後是工業技術，使我們能夠從環境中獲取比其他動物更多的能量，以便能夠做未來的剩餘物，然後能夠與其他人競爭未來的剩餘物，使人口更快地增長，這種熱力學與競爭性相結合的定義特徵是多麼基本，或者說是熱力學與進化理論相結合的，技術最終發展了我們提取能源和使用能源的能力，以獲得更多的東西，這增加了我們在戰爭和經濟戰爭中獲勝的能力，以及其他的東西，推動了軍備競賽的能力，更快地提取外部的眼睛等，最終推動了整個地球的脆弱性。
  one of the deepest definitions of life is actually an entropy pump something that can take more energy from the environment and externalize its entropy 18:00and so then you're looking at the way that human technology starting with stone tools and then agricultural tech and then industrial tech allowed us to harvest more energy from our environment than other animals to be able to do future surplus stuff and then to be able to compete with others over the future surplus and grow populations faster and how how fundamental of a kind of defining characteristic this thermodynamic combined with competitive or like it's a thermodynamic and then evolutionary theory together 18:30where the tech ends up evolving our capacity to extract energy and use energy for more stuff which increases our kind of ability to win at wars and economic wars and whatever else driving an arms race of the ability to extract external eyes etc faster driving ultimately fragility of the planet at large ([Time 0:17:51](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e5e8c83dd6000937f7e3))
- > 在自然界中，那些能夠捕獲更多能量的生態系統具有優勢，這最終導致了一個叫做克裡伯定律的比例法則，即動物的能量使用比例是其大小的四分之三，這對小鼠和藍鯨都適用，因此，生物體的大小決定了它使用多少能量。 如果你把地球上所有的國家加在一起，全球GDP的斜率正好是GDP規模的三分之二，雖然不完全一樣，但這種關係是成立的，即使是作為一個生物有機體，整個人類經濟也是如此
  in nature those those um ecosystems that are able to capture more energy have an advantage and it it ends up resulting in a scaling law called klieber's law which is that animals energy use scales to the three-quarter power of their size and this works for mice all the way up to blue whales and so the size of the organism show dictates how much energy it uses 20:00well lo and behold if you aggregate all the countries in the earth the the slope of global gdp is right around the the size of the gdp to the two-thirds power it's not exactly the same but the relationship holds even as a biological organism the whole human economy ([Time 0:19:32](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e62917834a0009f93830))
- > 當前的陽光是莊稼，古老的陽光是樹木，也許你會砍掉一棵100年的樹，然後古老的陽光是幾千萬到幾億年的，你是對的，你可以用技術來獲取這些潛在的能量池。
  current sunlight which is crops old sunlight which is trees maybe you'll chop down a 100 year tree and then ancient sunlight which is tens to hundreds of millions of years 21:30ago and you're right you can use technology to ex to access those pools of of potential energy ([Time 0:21:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e64f8f5340000922693e))
- > 穀物比你可以獵取的肉類和漿果等更容易儲存，這意味著你可以度過饑荒，更快地增長人口，然後如果你的人口增長更快，你就可以贏得的部落戰爭，現在你也有了更多值得另一個部落入侵的東西，所以現在你必須進行防禦和軍事，以及所有與擁有剩餘物有關的事情，現在第一次出現了需要處理剩餘物的經濟學，所以私有財產所有權和繼承權以及所有這些東西，這就像它是一個大問題，特別是嗯過渡是當我們的物種在伊甸園吃蘋果的時候。
  that grains were more storable than say what you could hunt and gather meats and berries and stuff more storable means you can make it through the famine and grow the population faster and then if you grow the population faster you can win a 22:00tribal warfare and now you also have more stuff that is worth invading for another tribe so now you have to do defense and military and all the things that go along with having that surplus and now for the first time the economics of needing to deal with surplus come about so private property ownership and inheritance and all those things it was like it was a big deal that particular um transition was when that was when our species ate the apple in the garden of eden ([Time 0:21:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e689b985270009454705))
- > 這也是人類世的開始，因為在這之前，你希望自然界基本保持狩獵和採集的方式，你第一次想開始砍伐一個地區，把它變成農業用地，種植大量的穀物，因為在採集環境中，沒有足夠的穀物是有用的，你必須在它後面劃線種植，然後能夠拖動犁，所以你可以認為人類世的開始和提取儲存能源的開始是相應的。
  that was also kind of in one 22:30way the beginning of the anthropocene because before that you want nature to be pretty much the way it is to hunt and gather from this the first time you want to start clear cutting an area to turn it into agriculture land for lots of grain because in a gather environment there's not enough grain to be useful you've got to row crop it to then be able to drag a plow behind it so you can kind of consider the beginning of the anthropocene and the beginning of extraction of stored energy corresponding together ([Time 0:22:29](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e6f317834a0009f93832))
- > 我們在地位和尊重等方面一直是平等的，但在消費方面，我們一直是非常平等的，因為我們沒有任何東西，沒有東西可以隨身攜帶，每個人在身體熱量之外的實際消費都是差不多的，但一旦我們開始的盈餘時，等級制度就開始了 是的，我們稱之為文明的開始，其規模遠遠超過了敦煌的數字，相當於如何馴化野生型人類，否則就是敦煌的部落
  what also happened um is that's when inequality really started to occur we were always in equal in terms of status and uh respect and things like that but we were always incredibly equal in terms of consumption because we didn't have anything we didn't have stuff to carry around with us everyone's uh actual consumption of of outside of the body calories was pretty much the same but once we started 23:30soaring surplus that's when the uh the hierarchies um started yeah the beginning of the thing we call civilization that started scaling well beyond the dunbar number which equaled how to domesticate wild-type humans that would have otherwise been dunbar tribal ([Time 0:23:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e7209926c10009a27dbe))
- > 體外能量是我們消耗的能量，但不是通過進食，而是在體外，所以在體內，美國人平均消耗2500卡路里，在體外，美國人平均每天消耗超過20萬卡路里，在燈光、飛機、購物中心、圖書館和公共汽車等，所以我們是唯一在體外大量使用能量的物種，這只是因為我們在使用這個儲存的碳氫化合物庫
  exosomatic energy is energy that we consume but not by eating it's outside of the body so inside the body the average american consumes like 2500 calories outside the body the average american consumes over 200 000 kilocalories per day 25:00um in the lights and the airplanes and the shopping centers and the libraries and the buses etc so we're the only species that massively uses energy outside of the body and that is only made available by the fact that we're accessing this pool of stored hydrocarbons ([Time 0:24:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e7688f534000092270a6))
- > 今天，我們身體中60%的氮氣有來自天然氣的化學特徵，所以我們直接從化石碳和碳氫化合物中大量增加了食物供應。
  sixty percent of the nitrogen in our bodies today has a chemical signature coming from natural gas so we've massively boosted the food supply directly from fossil carbon and hydrocarbons ([Time 0:31:07](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e8d4b8643700098bc2ea))
- > 一些國家已經將其經濟產出與能源使用脫鉤，有一種東西叫做GDP的能源強度，即我們需要多少能源來產生一美元的GDP，美國和英國都是以服務為基礎的經濟體，因此，我們實際上已經通過使用更少的能源來更有效地創造GDP，但從超級生物體的角度來看，重要的是我們未來的可持續性，我們的生態圈，我們的氣候，我們的海洋是整個人類系統的作用，整個人類系統是非常緊密地聯繫在一起，超過99%，因為美國和英國在美國，平均每個美國人消耗57桶石油價值的化石燃料，但我們從中國再進口17桶左右，我們不從中國進口石油，而是進口電視和塑料沙拉碗，以及類似的東西，這些能源是在中國燃燒的，我們為它支付美元，它來到這裡，所以它是我們的，它是我們消費的一部分。 我想說的是，在過去的五到八年裡，全球範圍內的能源和GDP似乎有了一些脫鉤，這是金融市場的一個偽命題，因為中央銀行在GDP計算中對養老基金的處理方式，導致了金融市場的大規模關閉，如果我想說如果或者我想說當股票市場重新調整的時候，這種關係將在99%以上收緊。
  some countries have decoupled their economic output from their energy use there's something called the energy intensity of gdp which is how much energy we need to generate a dollar of gdp the united states the united kingdom are service-based economies 36:00so we actually have gotten much more efficient generating gdp by using less energy but the the important thing from the super organism vantage point which is our future sustainability our ecosphere our climate our oceans is what the whole human system does and the whole human system is is extremely tightly tethered over 99 percent because the united states and the united kingdom 36:30um in in america the average american consumes 57 barrels of oil worth of fossil fuels per but we import another 17 or so from china in we don't import the oil from china we import the televisions and the plastic salad bowls and and things like that the energy was burned in china we paid dollars for it and it comes here so it's our it's part of our consumptive 37:00footprint but the bottom line is that um globally energy and gdp are tightly linked one other caveat i would say there the last five to eight years it seems to be globally a little bit more decoupling and this is an artifact of this massive uh off in the financial markets due to central banks because of the way that pension funds are treated in the gdp calculations and when and if 37:30i would say if or i would say when stock markets recalibrate that relationship will tighten back up around the the 99 plus percent ([Time 0:35:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2e9a58f53400009227daf))
- > 這種富裕的國家不做自己的製造、生產和廢物管理，主要出口科技服務，這讓它看起來有38%。 相對於國內的能源使用，它有更高的GDP，但這是因為它只是把所有的高能耗的東西出口到其他地方的製造業，然後再進口產品，我發現這一點，我發現很多東西都是這樣。你可以拿一個國家來說，它有一個很好的精靈係數，但這只是因為它把所有的廉價勞動力出口到其他地方，它依靠這些勞動力來獲得它的東西，所以你就像你沒有一個好的精靈係數，你的經濟不平等是需要使你的文明run仍然很高，因為你只是從其他地方的廉價勞動力中購買你的。
  this kind of wealthy nation that doesn't do its own manufacturing and production and waste management and largely exports kind of tech services can make it seem 38:30like it has higher gdp relative to its own domestic energy use but it's because it's just exporting all of its like really high energy intensive stuff to the manufacturing that's happening somewhere else it then imports the products of and i find this like i find this for so many things you can take a country that has a good genie coefficient but it's just because it exported all the cheap labor to somewhere else that it depends upon to get its stuff so you're like you don't really have a good genie coefficient your economic inequality that's needed to make your civilization 39:00run is still very high because you just buy your from cheap labor from somewhere else ([Time 0:38:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea1d8f53400009227db3))
- > 威廉-斯特凡-斯坦利-傑文斯是19世紀的經濟學家，他自相矛盾地預言，蒸汽機的巨大發明使事物比馬匹或之前的東西更有效率，但自相矛盾的是，即使它更有效率，人類最終會使用更多的能源，因為大多數人可以買得起東西，事情會做得更快，他們會建造更多的蒸汽機，這當然是事實。
  william stavan stanley jevins was a 19th century economist who paradoxically predicted that the massive 41:00beneficial invention of the steam engine which made things way more efficient than horses uh or what came before paradoxically would end up having humans use a lot more energy even though it was more efficient that's because most more people could afford things uh things would be done faster they would build more of these steam engines and that is of course what happened ([Time 0:40:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea6e8f53400009227db4))
- > 首先，技術是通貨緊縮的，因為市場體系和創新以及人們被激勵去做更好的發明，所以隨著時間的推移，像平板電視這樣的技術含量高的東西會越來越便宜，直到漸進式的你無法得到更便宜的東西，所以技術是通貨緊縮的。 與此相對應的是耗竭，即我們已經獲得了最好的化石碳氫化合物，這是我們經濟的主要投入，然後我們必須獲得下一個更難的部分，等等，最終什麼都沒有了，但我們還沒有到那一步，所以技術通縮和資源投入通脹這兩種力量正在進行鬥爭
  first of all technology is deflationary because the market system and innovation and people are incentivized to make better inventions so over time things that are tech heavy like flat screen tvs will get cheaper and cheaper until they asymptotically you just can't get them any cheaper but so tech is deflationary 42:00counter to that is depletion which is that we've accessed the best fossil hydrocarbons that are the main input to our economies and then we have to access the next harder tranche etc eventually there's nothing left but we're not there yet so these two forces between technological deflation and resource input inflation are are battling ([Time 0:41:38](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ea8fa5d5070009ec4098))
- > 第一類技術，第一類是使我們的能源使用，我們的能源捕獲更有效的方法，例如，我們可以開發新的太陽能電池，更有效率，或者我們可以採取一個發電廠，我們輸入的能源量，我們得到更多的電力，第二類技術是發明呃新的方法呃或方法人類使用能源的方式，我們過去是手工操作，現在我們有機器來做，或者像facebook這樣的新方式，我們以前從來沒有過，現在它是一個新的能源使用載體，所以這是第二類技術，主導著我們的全球技術組合，最終建立越來越多的東西，成為明年更多能源使用的載體，傑文悖論意味著如果某樣東西變得更有效率，人們就會購買更多的東西，或者他們在那件東西上省下的錢會在沃爾瑪買一些從中國買來的東西，所以最終發生的情況是，效率在很大程度上是為超級有機體服務的，所以只要我們把GDP作為我們的文化目標，市場系統和個人以及公司和企業通過GDP優化44:00的利潤，效率只是在一個正反饋循環中為這個系統提供更多資金，我們在未來會使用更多能源
  there's really two categories of technology the first tech the first 42:30category is ways to make our energy use our energy capture more efficient for example we can develop new solar voltaic cells that are more efficient or we could take a power plant and the amount of energy that we input we get more electricity out of that the second type of technology is inventing uh new ways uh or or ways 43:00that humans use energy that we used to do manually and now we have machines do it or new ways like facebook that we never had before and now it's a new vector for energy use so it's that second category of technology that dominates our our global technology portfolio which ends up building more and more things that are a vector for more energy use next year now jevin's paradox means 43:30that if something gets more efficient the people will buy more of it or the savings that they have from saving money on that thing will be spent at walmart on some things that they bought from china so what ends up happening is efficiency is in service of the super organism to a large extent so efficiency as long as we have gdp as our cultural goal where the market system and individual and and uh corporations and and businesses optimize 44:00profits via gdp efficiency will just feed more money into that system in a positive feedback loop and we'll use more energy in the future ([Time 0:42:28](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eac8c83dd60009380ff3))
- > 只要你的效率提高了，你就會得到一個全新的盈利潛力，而這些潛力是不存在的，我們最終會進入這些潛力，所以只要有一個內嵌的增長義務或圍繞淨增長的激勵措施，效率是能夠成為可持續發展的一種方式的想法是不可行的。
  anytime you get an increase in 45:30efficiency you get a whole new uh profitability potentials that weren't there and we end up going into those so the idea that efficiency is a way of being able to become sustainable doesn't work as long as there is an ins either an embedded growth obligation or an incentive around net growth ([Time 0:45:27](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eb09a5d5070009ec409a))
- > 所以我們在這個地方，在GDP和能源之間存在著這種聯繫，我們在能源上得到的回報越來越少，對資本的要求是指數級的，僅僅是因為利息，我們明年必須有比今年更多的資本，因為我們的金融系統的性質是這樣的，所以開始變得越來越大，需要繼續擁有更多的資本，這意味著需要繼續擁有更多的能源，越來越不容易獲得能源。 所以必須對海上石油鑽探和壓裂等進行技術創新，但最終你會用完這些，然後會有一個偉大的清算，所以這就是你所說的，還沒有一個偉大的清算，因為中間的步驟是你用中央銀行的擔保和救助之類的東西來掩蓋這個問題，但是是的，最終會有一個偉大的清算，我指的是偉大的簡化，是的，最終根據定義我們將不得不有一個後增長經濟
  so we're at this place where there's this this pegging between gdp and energy we're getting a diminishing return on our energy source and there's an exponential requirement on capital simply because of interest right we have to have more capital next year than we have the capital this year for the nature of the how we set up the financial system so then there starts to become this larger delta of need to keep having more capital which means need to keep having more energy have less and less easy to access energy 48:00so have to technologically innovate offshore oil drilling and fracking and things but eventually you kind of run out of that and then there's a great reckoning so this is what you call it there's not yet a great reckoning because the intermediate step is you paper over that with central bank guarantees and and bailouts and and things like that but yes eventually there's a great reckoning which i'm referring to as the great simplification and yes eventually by definition we will have to have a post-growth 48:30economy ([Time 0:47:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2eb64a5d5070009ec409b))
- > 我認為當我們沒有能力用債務和中央銀行的擔保來掩蓋這些生物物理現象時，我們最終會萎縮，而且這也是你最初的前提，我認為我們必須預測可能發生的事情，並嘗試讓我們的系統彎曲而不是斷裂，因為斷裂涉及到許多X-的類別。 彎曲意味著它為人類提供了另一種途徑，使其走向更理智、更持久、更有意義的文化，我們可以做到這一點的方法之一是對我們經濟的主要投入進行適當的定價，如果我們能夠不僅對碳，而且對所有不可再生的投入徵稅，那麼在人類的時間尺度上，任何不可 在人類的時間尺度上，這將是天然氣或銅或化石水的含水層或沙子或任何類似的東西 嗯，然後同時取消對人類的稅收 我們現在95％的稅收是對人類的勞動，所以如果我們刪除所有這些 你一年賺5萬，你保持你的5萬，你不必支付任何稅 但如果你買一個蘋果手機，有各種呃複雜昂貴的機器 呃，金屬和礦物在裡面，它可能需要兩三千美元，而現在是五百美元，所以如果我們有正確的價格，我們將能夠更好地以一種與我們的未來相一致的方式進行創新，我們可能會節約，我們不會只是嗯，飛到巴哈馬的旅行團或拉斯維加斯，或只是每天從亞馬遜購買，讓我們多一點多巴胺。
  i think we will eventually shrink when we run out of the ability to paper over these biophysical phenomenon with debt and central bank guarantees and too big to fail and artificially low interest rates and things like that and so this gets to your original premise i think we have to anticipate what might happen and try to have our system bend and not break because break gets into many of the categories of the x-risk that you're so fluent in bend means it gives humans another pathway forward towards a saner longer lasting more meaningful culture and one of the ways we could do that is get the prices right on the main input to our economies if we were able to not only carbon but all non-renewable inputs have a tax on anything that's non-renewable on human time scale so that would be natural gas or copper or fossil water aquifers or sand or anything like that um and then simultaneously remove tax on humans 95 of our taxes right now are on human labor so if we removed all those you make 50 000 a year you keep your 50 000 you don't have to pay any taxes but if you bought an iphone which has all kinds of uh complicated expensive machinery uh metals and and minerals in there it might cost two or three thousand dollars relative to five hundred dollars today so if we had the prices right we would be better able to innovate in a way that is um aligned with our future and we would probably conserve we wouldn't just um fly to the bahamas on a junket or vegas or or just buyfrom amazon every day to give us a little bit more dopamine ([Time 1:06:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2ee208f53400009227db6))
- > 你的意思是，整個市場被自然界補貼在一個即將用完的儲蓄賬戶上，整個市場大部分都是無利可圖的，因為總的成本被外部化了，一旦我們用完了儲存的免費廉價的東西，不再能夠處理污染的後果，就會迫使市場重組。一旦我們用完了儲存的免費便宜的東西，不再有能力處理污染的後果，一切的成本就會大幅上升，這就迫使我們對市場進行重組，而我們認為有利可圖的東西，可能會有數倍到數十個數量級，但目前是這樣的，這就是斷裂方案。 破裂的情況是，這一切都在沒有計劃、沒有藍圖、沒有安全氣囊、沒有全球供應鏈、沒有地緣政治的情況下發生，而動能戰爭是對這些危機的反應。
  what you're basically saying is the market as a whole is being subsidized by nature on a savings account that's about to run out and the entire market for the most part is mostly not profitable in a way that would be sustainable because of the total amount of costs that are being externalized and as soon as we run out of the stored free cheap stuff and stop being able to handle the consequences of the pollution the cost of everything goes up so much that it forces a restructure of the market and what we think is profitable and possible by multiples to orders of magnitude but it currently is and that's the break scenario well the break scenario is that the bend scenario is that we have a smaller economy and we change our cultural objectives away from gdb towards well-being and social capital and community and other things rather than gadgets the break scenario is that this all happens without planning without blueprints and airbags and the global supply chains and or the geopolitical uh kinetic warfare is the response to these sorts of crises ([Time 1:18:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b2e447c83dd6000937ea42?annotationId=62b2f03dc83dd60009380ff7))
