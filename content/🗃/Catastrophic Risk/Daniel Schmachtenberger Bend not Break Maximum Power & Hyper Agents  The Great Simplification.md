- > 我們以家庭、小企業、公司、民族國家的形式自我組織起來，優化剩余，但這并不是真正的剩余，而是剩余的金融代表，它與能源相聯系，與碳相聯系，這個系統作為一個超級生物體，已經失去控制，它并不是一個真正的物理實體，只是我們80億人的行為動態，只是追求這些文化目標，它不再由任何人控制，沒有政治家或億萬富翁09: 沒有任何政客或億萬富翁在引導它，所以這就是我想出的一種動力 我們已經把我們系統的規劃外包給了金融市場 而這種在全世界范圍內做出決定以保持優化的勢頭抑制了任何其他可能完全可行的、有意義的智慧或約束的途徑
  we self-organize as families small businesses corporations nation states to optimize surplus but it's not really surplus it's 09:00financial representations of surplus and that's tethered to energy tethered to carbon and that this system is out of control as a super organism um a super organism it's not really a physical entity it's just the behavioral dynamic of eight billion of us roughly um just pursuing these cultural objectives uh and it's no longer in anyone's control there's no politician or billionaire 09:30that is actually steering it so that that's kind of the dynamic that i've come up with is that we have outsourced the planning of our system to the financial market and that momentum worldwide of making decisions to keep that optimized suppresses any other paths of wisdom or constraint that might be totally viable and makes sense ([Time 0:08:49](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71b88bde7e400095752ac))
- > 金融系統有一個內嵌的增長義務，它必須持續增長，否則這個特定的系統就會崩潰，它必須以前一年的百分比持續增長，所以你有一個復利的東西，這意味著你有一個指數曲線，所以金融有一個指數的內嵌增長義務，但金融受現實世界的約束，你不能在現實世界的開采中指數增長，特別是你不能一直在可持續地開采東西，變成污染和垃圾，你不能一直擁有的能量，它需要將所有這些原子或位子無限制地移動。
  the financial system has an embedded growth obligation it has to keep growing or this particular system breaks and it has to keep growing at a percentage of the previous year so you have a compounding interest thing which means you have an exponential curve so there is an exponential embedded growth obligation on finance but finance is bound to the real world and you can't exponentially grow the extraction in the real world specifically you can't keep mining stuff on renewably and turning into pollution and trash and you can't keep having the 11:00energy that it takes to move all those atoms or the bits around um indefinitely ([Time 0:10:30](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71bc9bde7e400095752ad))
- > 計算仍然需要能源，所以即使我們在談論與數字產品和服務相關的資本時，它仍然依賴于能源，顯然需要能源來移動原子以制造計算基質，你必須進行大量的采礦，你必須進行大量的制造以制造計算機芯片、服務器和衛星等，然后計算系統需要能源。computation still takes energy and so even when we're talking about 12:00uh capital associated with digital goods and services it's still energy dependent it obviously takes energy moving atoms around to make the computational substrate you got to do a lot of mining and you got to do a lot of fabrication to make the computer chips and the servers and the satellites and whatever and then the computational systems require energy so the movement to digital doesn't get us off the need for energy ([Time 0:11:55](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71be9508ef70009ebc6fe))
- > 這就是為什么杰弗斯悖論是如此重要的原因 歸根結底，美元是在尋求任何地方的回報 他們會尋求盡可能高的回報，但他們也會尋求任何回報 在回報上會有一個冪律分布 所以我可以得到1000倍的回報，當然我會得到它 但如果我能得到3%的回報 百分之百的回報，我就會你知道大量的資本，我們就會這樣做，所以當你的效率提高時，你就會得到更便宜的工業投入，你知道更便宜的市場投入，這意味著很多原本無利可圖的東西現在變得有利可圖，所以盈利的表面積擴大了，這個杰文悖論就像每個關注環境問題的人都需要認真對待這個問題，就是你提高了效率，比如說能源生產，現在你有了更便宜的能源，能源是每個行業的關鍵投入之一，更便宜的投入意味著一大堆無利可圖的領域變得有利可圖，市場擴大了。
  this is why the jeffers paradox is so fundamental is ultimately the dollars are seeking returns anywhere and they'll seek the highest returns possible but they'll seek any returns too there will be a power law distribution on return so i can get 1000x return of course i'll get it but if i can get a three percent return i'll you know a large amount of capital we'll do that so when you get increases in efficiency you just get a cheaper industrial input you know a cheaper market input which means that a lot of things that weren't profitable now become profitable so the surface area of profitability expands 13:30and this jevon's paradox just like everybody who's focused on environmental issues needs to kind of take this very seriously which is you increase efficiency of say here energy production now you have cheaper energy energy is one of the key inputs to every industry cheaper input means a whole bunch of non-profitable areas become profitable and the market expands ([Time 0:13:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71c50508ef70009ebc6ff))
- > 因為這樣，我們仍然得到了美元和能源之間的耦合，美元處於指數增長曲線上，這意味著能源必須處於指數增長曲線上，你不可能永遠以指數方式提取能源，我們已經處於碳氫化合物的收益遞減階段，也就是說，碳氫化合物進入碳氫化合物，能源投資的收益遞減，但它必須跟上一個非常垂直化的指數曲線，呃，14。 有一個問題，你只能定量地緩解和補貼這個東西這麼久，有一個根本性的問題，所以答案當然是可再生能源，很好，我們會用可再生能源滿足所有的能源，但現在可再生能源的能源投資回報率意味著你必須使用更多的石油來獲得非 曲線仍然不符合我們目前的觀點，所以有一些非常深刻的考慮，以及內嵌的增長義務和金融與真正的15世紀的物理限制之間的關係。 00世界的原子和能量的關係，以及這些之間的關係，有一堆複雜的東西，但這個簡單的總結給了你超級生物體的新陳代謝的指數增長。
  because of that we still get this coupling between dollars and energy dollars are on an exponential growth curve up that means energy has to be on an exponential growth curve up you can't do exponential extraction of energy forever and we're already on a diminishing return on hydrocarbons meaning uh hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons out the energy return on energy investments and diminishing return and yet it has to keep up with a very verticalizing uh part of the exponential curve on um 14:30finances there's a problem there right like and you can only quantitative ease and subsidize that thing for so long there's like a fundamental problem there and so of course the answer is just renewables well great we'll meet all of that energy with renewables except right now the energy return on energy of investment of the renewables means you got to use way more oil to get the non-oil producings off and the curves still just don't work in the current way we're looking at it so there's just some very deep reckoning and the relationship between the embedded growth obligation and finance and the physical limits of the real 15:00world atomically and energetically and the relationship between those there's a heap of complexity from there but that simple summary kind of gives you the exponential growth of the metabolism of the super organism ([Time 0:14:03](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71c9cbde7e400095752ae))

  there is no recognition that all the financial claims in the world be they stocks or bonds or pensions or retirement fund when they are cashed in they have to be cashed in on something that will require energy and materials to qua to convert 19:00and and that is just a fundamental disconnect in macroeconomics ([Time 0:18:44](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b718b6bde7e400095752ab?annotationId=62b71d4dbde7e400095752b0))
