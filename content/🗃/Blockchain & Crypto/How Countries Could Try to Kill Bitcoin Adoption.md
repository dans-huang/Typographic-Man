## Highlights
- Bitcoin is [an idea](https://medium.com/@interstellarbitcoin/bitcoin-has-already-won-bf2388d191bd). It is technology that provides property rights, rule of law, economic freedom, free markets and, ultimately, sound money to the individual.
  Bitcoin is a fixed supply ledger, defining who owns what and enabling people to transact peer-to-peer. Its ledger is enforced by proof-of-work, a consensus mechanism that utilizes energy in a way that [removes inefficiencies and creates abundance.](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-is-not-wasteful)
  Fundamentally, Bitcoin is information and math, thus [banning it would have wide implications](https://dergigi.com/2021/08/02/implications-of-outlawing-bitcoin/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttn4k3jg42twgz3d82q6e1))
- So why ban it?
  Control.
  Control over the ability to print money and the resulting [Cantillon effect](https://river.com/learn/terms/c/cantillon-effect/). Control over what energy usage is ‚Äúmorally acceptable‚Äù and what is not, such as via ‚ÄúESG‚Äù (environmental, social and governance) mandates. Control over a populace. Total authoritarianism.

- Stage One
  Unfavorable tax status for bitcoin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttq5mmw63qwjjen9age794))
- Stage Two
  Unfavorable regulation, ban the use of Bitcoin technology (aka make [math and information illegal](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-eu-attacks-bitcoin-due-to-a-comprehension-problem)), internet censorship. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttqdmgzp1f8dr99cs9ydq1))
- Stage Three
  Energy shortages, internet outages, food shortages.
  Stage Four
  Mass genocide of Bitcoiners. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmttrwr3cqvysh2hvxraj07y))
- It is important to remember that Bitcoiners have deeply held beliefs, generally summarized as: Bitcoin is good for humanity and money should be outside the control of the state. Bitcoin‚Äôs idea of a fixed-cap supply goes against orthodox economics, political structures and the status quo.
  Bitcoiners are [burning the ships, and there is no going back](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-must-burn-the-ships). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtttyrm5khwagxdg71y0v6r))
- However, game theory is on Bitcoin‚Äôs side. Eventually, state actors will face increasing problems to subsidize censorship and spam the network. Assuming attackers must print money to fund the attack, this devalues their currency against bitcoin. It‚Äôs a short-term attack that could only be effective if paired with a ban, propaganda and other measures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtv1fnpryhwzzee2vpc04g3))
- Luckily, bitcoin is information, with no physical location. Everywhere and nowhere.
  This poses a unique challenge for banning bitcoin: geographic arbitrage.
  As countries crack down on bitcoin, the incentive for other countries to adopt bitcoin as legal tender grows. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtv4zrjrt41wxywa5eyfa37))
- Bitcoiners ‚Äî and all people ‚Äî have an obligation to resist immoral and unjust laws. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtv731566wss4a7pzdsgm3r))
- So, how do we defend against these attacks?
  1. Shill to as many people as possible; the more people that hold bitcoin, the better.
  2. Teach the importance of self-custody and running your own full node. There are great resources by [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides) and many others.
  3. Support bitcoin-only individuals, businesses and countries.
  4. Improve the underlying network and scaling technologies. For example, [BIP324 (a bitcoin improvement proposal for P2P encryption)](https://twitter.com/orionwl/status/1541320693073285121) and Layer 2s such as the Lightning Network.
  5. Build resilient communities and circular bitcoin economies.
  6. Become a Bitcoiner who is a beacon of hope in an abyss of darkness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gmtv85a9s80h9pw5g05xf87m))
