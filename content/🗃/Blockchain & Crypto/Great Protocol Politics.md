## Highlights
- Not only has technology already changed the global order, but it is also changing the nature of both companies and states themselves. The 21st century belongs not to China or the United States‚Äînor to tech companies as traditionally understood. It belongs to the internet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp967tyeex9d8pqfpwzfxchk))
- This is true for many reasons, of which perhaps the most important is the rise of decentralized protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum that are controlled by neither states nor companies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp968c91tzg3062zmez3tx83))
- Many of the global technology firms‚Äô weaknesses ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96dyj0ps59gerx5atrtw0z))
- are addressed by the introduction of crypto protocols, which can safeguard property and execute contracts beyond the boundaries of traditional nation states. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96e3p7fv6ab2y9mpvz5t1v))
- But technology‚Äôs challenge to traditional geopolitics goes beyond crypto protocols, tech companies, and even digital space itself, as it has begun reshaping the physical world. Here are 10 ways in which we are transitioning from an age of geopolitics to one of techno-politics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96fyrra9e0p56m6y5bcmnm))
- 1. Network proximity is now on par with physical geography ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96g29xvnk17ne8vhkqs04w))
- Think of it as a digital Atlantis‚Äîa new continent floating in the cloud where old powers compete and new powers arise. Within this cloud continent, the unit of distance between two people is not the travel time between their positions on the globe but rather the degrees of separation in their social networks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96j1ngcmbyrpyhnv1dgde6))
- Encryption serves as the digital equivalent of physical fortifications in the cloud, allowing any user to defend their digital property without resorting to traditional munitions‚Äîno physical force required. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96nzz4rk10degry542c0ym))
- 2. National currencies will face digital monetary competition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96pfy4mntytf3hhyapeage))
- But so long as people can afford to or are allowed to leave, they have more options than ever for a more hospitable host state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96ykwx9qhtaabzc0ej0grr))
- 4. Bits are finally reshaping atoms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96z3t5ahqshgverqvqacw7))
- We are about to enter an age of global monetary competition, where national currencies must earn their place in someone‚Äôs wallet portfolio every hour of every day, even among citizens of their own countries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96s46qdcc78ejbfm7hpnc1))
- Once something works online, it can be printed out anywhere and scaled faster than ever before. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9709j9tbk6a54d8a7fq6t1))
- A government that doesn‚Äôt understand the digital may not be able to control the physical. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp972ywt4az2n0sk6ktdwmjk))
- 3. The remote economy has created a talent market for citizens ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96t9ez4bjdec5y3e440d5c))
- In other words, it‚Äôs short-sighted to think technology will remain indefinitely confined to the digital realm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp972aq27padmm8rxr9dvdqv))
- States will need to reinvent themselves as masters of new technologies, both digital and physical‚Äîor fall behind and witness their best citizens leave for jurisdictions that do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp973rpk0whm1hn18x6j90hc))
- 5. Cloud-based regulators are outcompeting state-based regulators ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp973v951rv0wbs1kmyenhgz))
- Government is what economist Mancur Olson famously termed a ‚Äú[stationary bandit](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938736),‚Äù extracting rents in exchange for providing benefits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp96xf1x4g6zjtmkjrzhr76v))
- In a real sense, these tech companies are more modern regulators than the paper-based models of the 20th century. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp977xk0q9nbfq03w8z74sny))
- First, these companies are, in important instances, already achieving state ends faster than the state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp978at48zqk0czwp42r75cf))
- Second, these companies won‚Äôt remain companies forever‚Äîthey‚Äôll be phased out by protocols that split the upside with their users. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9790mrvqpjgazy0q6dfceg))
## New highlights added January 11, 2023 at 11:20 PM
- Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was set up to regulate Merck and Pfizer, not 1 million biohackers; the Federal Aviation Administration was built for Boeing and Airbus, not 1 million drone hobbyists; and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was created to go after Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, not 1 million Web3 developers. The people running these institutions typically have career tenure; they were not democratically elected and are [not easily fired](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/employee-relations/reference-materials/douglas-factors.pdf). They are thus not obviously accountable to the public they claim to serve. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe3b70t3a0m80maht860fec))
- Crypto protocols, by contrast, allow millions of active participants‚Äîboth customers and producers‚Äîin a market to develop decentralized regulatory [mechanisms](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/decentralized-finance/) that avoid both the perils of [captured](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/nobel-economist-george-stigler-on-capture-theory-and-the-inevitability-of-businesses-seeking-regulation-and-tariffs/) state regulators and corporate self-regulators. It is only a matter of time before cloud-based entities emerge for decentralized regulation of industries beyond cryptocurrencies. Importantly, these bodies will be truly global and boundary-spanning, unlike today‚Äôs geographically constrained national regulators. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4gb5zsjtjp1gc100qsg9e))
- 6. Property rights have become encryption ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4gdfarb7d9wq7mf4gxhd9))
- The state‚Äôs conception as the legitimate guardian of private property extends back to at least philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. But cryptocurrencies challenge this view as they establish a full-fledged theory of digital property rights outside the state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4k04gpw46xevq98n094yg))
- [Jacob Appelbaum](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-ekVVZgGOThtG6fXb/page/n69/mode/2up?q=math), ‚ÄúNo amount of violence will ever solve a math problem,‚Äù particularly those devised for secure encryption. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4k8zepdxh46bxb7bwcw59))
- 7. International rule of law is becoming rule of code ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4kcfc0a1awjbwwmspxpbv))
- small countries would prefer some kind of order rather than being at the mercy of one power (the United States) that gives international rule of law only lip service and another power (China) that doesn‚Äôt even do that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4qvre301v2gc3c66mvg0m))
- For this, at least in the commercial realm, we believe they will increasingly turn to what we call ‚Äúrule of code.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4r5z8q4zgk4wwaj5z1fca))
- Property rights themselves can be digitized through geographic information system (GIS) mapping and land cadastration (surveying and parceling of property), eroding the bureaucratic opacity that favors predatory governments. And rather than subject themselves to expropriation risks, investors could demand governments put up collateral codified in smart contracts that would be forfeited in default. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4tk73c9t6x4stnfvqhzf6))
- We are still in the early days, but enforceable international law may become synonymous with decentralized smart contracts, at least in the context of international trade. And beyond trade, crypto protocols provide [transnational protection](https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/is-bitcoin-anarchy-or-civilization) for civil liberties like freedom of speech and privacy. This is not yet the entirety of what the rules-based order purports to protect, but the ability to guarantee free speech and free markets to anyone with an internet connection is a major step forward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4wvn5fzvn8fasdh1dbe4k))
- 8. Web3 is addressing global inequality by sharing the reward‚Äîand the risk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe4wxqq2cdy2mcvfyzgm56a))
- From a political standpoint, anti-technology activists have only been able to muster [slim and contentious](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-battle-continues-prop-22-struck-5046989/) margins of support for new regulations because [app workers](https://rein.pk/replacing-middle-management-with-apis) did not profit as much from the rise of the sharing economy as app developers‚Äîgiving a wedge for class actions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe38788t72fcmbqv5dxbn6r))
- However, the next step is the full Web3-based decentralization of online marketplaces and sharing economy services, which is already well underway via peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies (so-called [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)). These new forms of transnational regulation, where app users have a stake‚Äîand a say‚Äîin how their platforms are run, will expand beyond cryptocurrencies to the peer-to-peer exchange of other goods and services over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe38nmhwq4qf5ahnwnfywk3))
- The most promising way to resolve this may be via Web3 protocols, which can be thought of as a variant of universal basic income that splits the reward‚Äîand the risk‚Äîof building a giant tech service across millions of volunteer asset holders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe547p8qz7z8nfpxxc5mah0))
- with the rise of [decentralized finance](https://defipulse.com/), there is now an incredible variety of financing mechanisms to allow smart people with no money to find smart people with money to build tools that allow all people to make money. And that is how Web3 may accomplish what no antitrust action or arbitrary seizure could. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe55gxgztd7xb5kbv0rn4g4))
- 9. Companies, cities, currencies, communities, and countries are all becoming networks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe55jg1jj671ekfkx8759vb))
- We should start thinking of collections of people‚Äîwhether communities, cities, companies, or countries‚Äîas cohesive agents unto themselves, less constrained by territoriality and with different layers aligned with one another in shifting combinations. Physical governments can, for example, integrate with digital networks, and companies can run as apps on a city state‚Äôs dedicated blockchain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe580k10qscfwzsr8fb76bd))
- 10. Power is decentralizing away from the United States and China ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5dswzfbb0a8d7pdt7v47w))
- About [75 percent](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) of the world‚Äôs population, more than [60 percent](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/gdp_share/) of global GDP, and around [50 percent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-26/the-geography-of-the-world-s-billionaires?sref=wAVxlDts) of all billionaires are neither Chinese nor American. Those two superpowers may well fight, but it‚Äôs not obvious if the rest of the world will want to align with either party. Indeed, with the rise of decentralized protocols, we anticipate that many states in the middle may decide to use Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains for China- and U.S.-resistant communication and financial transaction channels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5fmzcnvs9ryqq5919w3hj))
- That is, in addition to building national stacks (data and app ecosystems) for domestic transactions and communications, countries may use neutral protocols for international transactions and communications. This gives every country a choice: Rather than being forced to take sides in a new Cold War, they can update the ‚ÄúNon-Aligned Movement‚Äù to form an ‚Äú[Aligned Movement](https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/#the-decentralized-movement),‚Äù where they rally around their joint sovereign stakes in Web3 protocols to facilitate cross-border trade. Early signs of this are already visible with [Latin American](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1402279912623464458) countries adopting Bitcoin. Not incidentally, such protocols will also command the respect (and investment) of many millions of Chinese and American citizens. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5h0znsedr6m7pngynpqst))
- the future will be a decentralized race to the top as countries, cities, companies, and communities‚Äîphysical and virtual‚Äîcompete to attract talent and capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5hnw4w251em9t1rsbhaat))
- We do not argue that states are irrelevant; rather, they will be more relevant if they embrace the arrow of history and work with the network and less relevant if they attempt rearguard actions against it. Such is the nature of great protocol politics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5j5vtt9nds1s5s562qwez))
- Web3 protocols could also reduce polarization and inequality by giving citizens more of a stake in the system‚Äîas is already underway with experiments in New York City, Miami, and Wyoming. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpe5m3mwej5d9500jrdx40ra))
