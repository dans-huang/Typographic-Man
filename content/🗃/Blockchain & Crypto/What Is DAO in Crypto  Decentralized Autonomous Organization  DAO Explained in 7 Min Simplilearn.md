- blockchain is a system of storing data that makes it difficult or impossible to change hack or manipulate the data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9xpf1m2erq54wx5sd2ftp))
- it's basically a digital log of transactions that are duplicated and spread across the blockchain's whole network of computers and the dow is something that makes use of its rules and policies for its proper functioning ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9yw09z7qa0tv78h2sk0r2))
- a DAO or decentralized autonomous organization is a blockchain
  based organization that is collectively owned and controlled by its members they have built in resources that no one can access without the group's permission ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9z6k5pe3ycr98tmbqvem1))
- all proposals are implemented using voting processes to make decisions upon its rules and policies ensuring that everyone in the organization gets a say ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9zd590qyx1q4q60vw7q1s))
- this whole system majorly runs on ethereum blockchain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqp9zgpp3hjhf2rdszwyqp4v))
- smart contracts are the backbone of DOA ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa2w7z15aa00v1a9a4n3jd))
- smart contracts are programs that run when certain conditions are met and are stored on a blockchain ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa3783jybfjc19drkfxaxa))
- step one is when the documentation of the idea takes place in the similar way in DAO ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa5s77bffrgrx05cgj9056))
- a group of people write these smart contracts to administer the organization once the contract goes live on the ethereum network changes to its rules can be proposed only by voting the contract automatically fails if the rules are violated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpa63epb1eq3yjvqghf2kct))
- step two which is a funding period in which pitching of ideas takes place in front of the selected member sand investors of the organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpak2a2h4xbha5xchdqaces))
- similarly people in the DAO organization contribute money to the dow by purchasing tokens that signify their membership in the organization ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpakfn8hyzaw851fh55n823))
- when the funding period ends it proceeds to step three that is when the approval and implementation process of the idea takesplace or say the DAO starts to operate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpamdsmbtg51hs08ngd0aqk))


 DAOs can continually improve and grow just like people because their shareholders can submit and then even vote on changes to them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpazrhr4emwjr10hf9x6ywp))
- in the world of crypto a DAO may launch with a few million tokens every token is a vote and whoever holds the most tokens can have the largest votes this gives the tokens a price and it also gives them ause it also allows the dao to improve make changes and evolve as the world evolves now this includes actually hiring voting on a salary and then technically even employing certain developers within the autonomous organization it would then just pay them with cryptocurrency ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb0rqnd724ffpxx33qpqyc))
- benefit number one is that it's trustless and this is probably the biggest benefit of a dao ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb33wazcdabgkr9sxjwkdj))
- in fact you do not need to trust any ceo or manager or leader with your decision making skills the programor the whole organization will continue no matter if a major developer stops working on the projector even if the funding goes away ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb3rjdb9s8ey5cf5rnp5y7))
- another benefit is that they cannot be shut down ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb417dm2czc9m031nz8gme))
- the last benefit of a DAO is that it is open sourcedaos are also open source which means
  that their code is out there for anyone to look atand even improve upon open source projects are usually much more reliable simply because other programmers can help the main developers find some bugs in their code and then even propose ways to fix them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb50fazknxqsvcn3xbd8pb))
- the first downside is that they are vulnerable to attacks since anyone can look at the code it also means attackers can look at it if these attackers know intimately how the code works they can then reverse engineer the attacks
  and even test the code before deploying it to make sure that their code works if it does the DAO could be attacked ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb5gc51m49nzavv2p8asa7))
- the second downside that we have found is that there's no business secrets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb6avhabdzhbemvtepayd6))
- in a dow though business secrets are difficult to keep secret since the code
  is all open source and really anyone can look at how the dao is set up ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqpb6x1zyjbqf2fefnmaabg1))
