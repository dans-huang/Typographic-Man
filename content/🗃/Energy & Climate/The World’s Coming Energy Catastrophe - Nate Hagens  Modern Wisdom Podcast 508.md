## Personal Note
- 經濟現況：能源盲、債務驅動著消費導向的經濟型態、政府以貨幣政策等諸多措施干預自由市場、實以預支未來能源創造當下的帳面經濟成長（GDP）和短期的表象穩定、鼓勵奢侈/享樂生活型態、以稅收懲罰生產力與創新、通貨膨脹侵蝕貨幣的實際購買力
  
- 導正後的經濟遠景：支付正確的能源價碼（以供給、需求、及投入能源計價）、以儲蓄和創新為核心美德、以去中心化的絕對有限貨幣（BTC）為所有價格進行正確的能源標價（有限貨幣將與有限能源重新建立正確的掛勾）、人透過犧牲當下酬賞或為他人創造價值來獲得「真正的」經濟成長（累積真正的購買力或透過創新來提升購買力）、缺乏短期的「穩定」經濟成長但將出現無預期（但不意外）的科技革新以提升人類生活和購買力、人的購買力將因貨幣與能源掛勾而波動、進而引發人們思考並僅為真正迫切的需求買單、降低人們不必要的奢侈/享樂生活型態、使人們再次重視生命中有價值且免費的事物（人際關係、意義等）、移除懲罰生產力與創新的稅收（事物的價格已經與能源綁定故正確定價）、通貨膨脹將僅受限於供給（能源的投入）並刺激人們的生活型態選擇和科技革新
  
  >In a truly Bitcoinized world, money can no longer be leveraged as a source of power, because the network is weakened by those seeking to exploit it for riches and strengthened by those seeking mutuality and self-sovereign communitarianism. And in time, as this norm becomes ingrained in the psyches of people and communities the world over, those seeking power and gain will be viewed as a puzzling anachronism, zombies of a bygone age that no longer holds any meaning in the collective memory of the species. - Dan Weintraub ["FIAT MONEY AS A DIALECTICAL MONOLITH, BITCOIN AS A BENEVOLENT SOLUTION"](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/fiat-money-monolith-bitcoin-solution)

This is why I believe that it will take generations, centuries, for Bitcoin to be fully realized. Not until the dialectic triad is broken with regard to fiat money will Bitcoin become the absolute idea, that internalized reality, that will save humanity from its own worst self.

- 待思考：
  1. 債務是否仍將存在？以什麼形式？具備什麼意義？
     Jeff Booth已回答此問題
  2. 世界經濟將被NGU「誘騙」到BTC上？如何導正新世界經濟的核心目標？

- > i think uh we live in a culture that focuses on technology and human ingenuity and money 01:00as the things that describe our wealth and our future trajectory and i think culturally educationally we misunderstand or fail to recognize the importance of ecology and energy to our lives ([Time 0:00:51](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecf94b504ebb000900cd42))
- > everything we do requires energy every single thing that ends up in a good or service that contributes to gdp or gross domestic product are the size of our economy 02:30requires energy to invent to mine the materials for it to create to distribute to operate to maintain to fix and to dispose of without energy all of our technology would just be sculptures and so without energy our cities would be museums and this makes sense right except we assume that we will have the energy 03:00we have now uh indefinitely and that's where the risk comes in ([Time 0:02:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecf97d95a485000984aacc))
- > let's talk a little bit about energy properties and energy quality so there are lots of different forms of energy and we use predominantly fossil energy which we are pulling out of the ground 10 million times faster than it was trickle charged by daily photosynthesis of the sun so the master 04:30resource in the global economy now is is crude oil and from that come diesel fuel and gasoline and kerosene and jet fuel and bunker fuel and six thousand other plastic precursors oil is the master resource oil is found where there were ancient oceans and it so happens that you and i live in a country where a lot of ancient oceans were and so america has used more oil in the last 20 years in the 05:00last 50 years since the dawn of time than any other country ([Time 0:04:01](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecf9c5504ebb000900cd43))
- > we are using as a global culture 100 billion barrel of oil equivalents of coal oil and natural gas every year so if each of those is worth four and a half years of human labor we're adding roughly the equivalent of 500 billion human worker equivalents to the real 07:00five billion human worker equivalents we're paying pennies on the dollar for this because what we're doing is all our economic system is doing is paying for the cost of extraction how much does it cost us to go into the permian basin and pull that ancient sunlight out and add it to our economies that's what the economists look at we're not paying for the tens of millions of years of creation nor of the pollution like climate change and ocean acidification 07:30so why is this a problem because this stuff we're treating it culturally as if it were interest but the reality is we're drawing down the principle ([Time 0:06:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfa02504ebb000900cd44))
- > if we were to stop drilling for environmental reasons for lack of capital for political reasons for any reason at all our oil production in the united states which is around 12 million barrels a day right now and we consume 20 million by the way so we're still importing a good deal of what we consume if we stop drilling our oil production would drop by 40 the first year and by like 25 the second year and 20 percent the third year and 09:30that's because all the oil wells that we've drilled in the past are depleting rapidly and a higher and higher percentage of our oil production is this tight oil the shale oil that depletes rapidly so we're like this red queen alice in wonderland scenario where we have to run faster and faster just to stay in place and so the reason this is a problem is oil is the master resource and it underpins everything in globalization 10:00our transportation global supply chains the complexity of our system ([Time 0:09:02](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfa5b4ee3cd0009969fc6))
- > the other aspect of energy that we don't quite understand is people say oh well if oil is running out we'll just go to solar and wind and solar and wind are viable they're robust they're mature they're not terribly expensive but first of all they are electricity okay so solar wind geothermal all those 10:30things produce electricity and electricity is only around 21 percent of global energy use the rest is heat and liquid fuels and other things like and transportation things like that the other challenge with with renewables is is that they're they're intermittent so we have to either couple them with something like natural gas which we can turn on right away when when there's a power demand you live in texas you know what's happening right now this week 11:00people are you can't have everything running and everything growing there are limits uh and if you have a heat wave like you do right now and it's really still and the wind isn't blowing you could have five times as much wind installed as you do today and it's still not going to give you power so you have to have natural gas or something like that as a complement or batteries or or use less and the used last part is not in our 11:30political conversation but it's coming uh in my opinion and the sooner that individual people start changing their perception of energy services and what does it really mean to live a good life do i need all this energy and stuff the more pilots and examples will have of of different cultural paths ([Time 0:10:06](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfa919533640009871077))
- > here's a quick review of nuclear like solar and wind it is electricity so only 20 percent of our our global 17:00current situation is electric now we could change more things to electric and we probably should but if all of a sudden we miraculously had 10 times as much nuclear power today it still wouldn't solve some of these problems because oil is a declining liquid fuel that's step number one or point number one point number two is just like solar and wind have different uh production profiles 17:30um that are different than the human demand if you look at texas when the most energy is used in the late afternoons because people are coming home and they have air conditioning on and then the middle of the night there's a there's a trough because people are sleeping so what the perfect energy source is like natural gas because you can turn it on when you need it and you can turn it off when you don't need it nuclear you can't really turn off it's just always on and it's flat 18:00so nuclear plus natural gas good combination solar and wind plus natural gas good combination nuclear alone can't meet the the variability of human energy use so far point number two point number three is it takes a lot of capital and a lot of time and a lot of complexity to build out nuclear and some of the issues that i'm talking about are coming this decade uh we 18:30haven't talked about money yet i don't know if you want to but that's a central part of this story so there's there's a long time lag on nuclear point number four we don't have the uranium for nuclear to extend probably beyond six or seven decades um i mean there uranium is much more abundant than high quality oil at this point but it's also not infinite point number five would be 19:00the cost of nuclear um the negative environmental costs are always at the tail end and it's true that i think people have overreacted to chernobyl and fukushima and the cancer risks there but it's because we've had this cohesive world system that's held together and we have 450 odd nuclear plants in the world what if there was some event that caused a breakdown in social complexity and an 19:30inability to maintain these nuclear plants the environmental cost would then be discovered so we have to kind of maintain these things in perpetuity for there not to be some meltdown things so those are the few things but i do personally feel probably we're going to need nuclear a lot more nuclear as part of the mix going forward this century but it's not a direct one for one solution to these problems ([Time 0:16:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfb527c39e60009d8ad1c))
- > the issue really isn't that we're running out of oil we were running out of oil from when the first well was drilled in 1859. 24:30the issue is that we're running out of enough oil at an affordable price to maintain economic growth and once we can't continue to grow our economies and the economic growth now is at a 50-year low economic growth for for our country peaked in the early 1970s and we've grown the whole time since then but we've grown at lower amounts every year once we aren't able to grow 25:00we face this metaphorical or not so metaphorical musical chair situation because of the amount of monetary claims on real resources so money is created by commercial banks making loans without any reference to how much oil or environmental services or natural resources or materials exist and so we keep growing our monetary claims on our underlying physical reality and 25:30every time you spend a dollar from your wallet or from your bank you spend it on something that requires energy so we keep growing the amount of monetary claims we have when our energy is actually slowly inexorably declining ([Time 0:24:21](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfc2a953364000987107d))
- > money is is a claim on energy and debt is a claim on future energy so when a country when a person or a country runs into financial difficulties and they can't afford what they want or need they will borrow money 27:30to do that and that borrowing is an increase in the world's future claims on energy and so we have the the challenge we're going to have in coming decades is we have all these financial claims on a dwindling pool of of energy and resources and the ultimate answer and we won't choose this answer until we have to is we're gonna have to use less ([Time 0:27:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfc7d7c39e60009d8ad1d))
- > gdp is really just a measure for how much stuff we burn in the world because how do you mean that every single product that ends up in the world economic system that's counted as 29:00a good or service started somewhere on the planet with a small fire in some factory there was energy underpinning it all ([Time 0:28:46](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfcb27c39e60009d8ad1e))
- > 95 of our money is created at commercial banks when they make a loan they are not loaning out existing capital they are creating money um as long as there is a credit worthy borrower but what they're not creating is the interest on the loan 31:30so right there there's an embedded growth obligation in our system ([Time 0:31:13](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfd240d1fdf0009443eb3))
- > i can break this down in a short example say that you go into the bank of austin and you have a cool business idea and they like you and you have a credit worthy personality and history and they are in good standing with the federal reserve chris here's a million dollars at that point they put a million dollars into your account at the bank 32:00and simul that that's your asset and simultaneously they put chris owes us a million dollars on their asset li ledger so in the world nothing has happened you both have a million and you owe a million and they both gave a million and they are owed a million but two other things happened that people don't often talk about number one is there's a million dollars more of purchasing power in our 32:30world in our economic system that is a claim on future energy and resources you could invest that in a business or you could just take a cruise or buy a yacht to go tool around lake austin or whatever you want but it's all a potential future claim on energy and resources the second thing is they did not create the interest for you so during your job or whatever you do you have to eventually pay them back the million dollars and every year in the 33:00meantime you have to pay the interest uh 50 grand or whatever the percentage rate on that is so if you add that up globally there is an imperative that we have to grow to maintain prior financial claims simultaneously that growth it draws down our natural capital and creates environmental externalities that you pointed out before pretty much are not included in our prices ([Time 0:31:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfdb94ee3cd0009969fc8))
- > countries in europe in order to maintain their standing with the european central bank where the european central bank still allows them to borrow they can only borrow if their debt to 34:00gdp is under a certain threshold and so as they have more and more debt their gdp isn't growing enough to stay under that threshold so they're adding new things into the definition of gdp like prostitution and drugs what were previously illicit drug sales now uh that that's a tiny example but it also gives us a glimpse of 34:30what are the things that we really care about because there's a lot of things that you and i do in our lives possibly are our most favorite things that aren't included in gdp making love with your partner going for a walk in the woods playing with your dogs none of those things are included in gdp so this this question of how can we get our evolutionary emotional states of our ancestors with using less energy and materials 35:00in other words what is an economy for this is like front and center going to start to be a real question ([Time 0:33:49](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecfddf0d1fdf0009443fd6))
- > the fundamental problem here isn't climate change and it isn't energy depletion it's a social animal that is a population now of eight billion of us that are self-organizing as families as small businesses as 50:30corporations as nation states to optimize profits the profits are directly linked to energy the energy is directly linked 85 to fossil energy which is finite and the whole thing is creating waste so until we change that system i don't think i'll be wrong about the general direction of the story i've told you ([Time 0:50:13](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ecffc640f01100095ea8b5))
- > the larger issue that more people are not talking about is how we are going to economically transition to a lower energy and material throughput society in the coming decades because all of our cultural plans our institution our government plans are expecting more in the future and not only are they expecting more but the emotional clues that we're getting from the stimulus package and from the stipends and the artificial management of the financial system all give us this complacency that these things can't happen ([Time 1:02:14](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ed01cff6b1e20009d96de0))
- > humans are status seeking creatures biology you know a peacock has that ornate feathers at three fitness hits one they're more uh energy materials have to go to create the tail number two is it's more conspicuous to predators and number three if a predator sees you it's less likely that you'll get away all three of those negative fitness hits are evolutionarily natural selection sexually selected for by the female p hen preferring that so humans before the agricultural revolution we are biological creatures too we're midway between a tournament and a pair bonding species which is why men are on average six inches taller than women world over there are plenty of women that are taller than plenty of men but physiologically we have this history and status was always very important consumption was egalitarian for most of our history but how we competed back in the day meaning 50 000 years ago was by kindness or hunting ability or storytelling ability yams it was yams well yams would be one example but the point is that we do compete and the potlatch indians in northwest washington they would compete by throwing the most lavish ceremony and party to give away the wealth of the chief to the neighbors and however much they could give away was the signal of how much status they would have so the key is you're absolutely right right now we're competing for bank accounts and shopping centers and pecuniary wealth and expensive watches and night plumbing or whatever but if our society suddenly the women preferred the best gardeners that grew the largest tomatoes the rodal books at amazon and barnes nobody will be sold out in a weekend so yes how we get our status and right now a lot of us get it on facebook and instagram likes and it's even a fake status it's it's a super normal stimuli version of the status but we're not going to stop comparing ourselves to others full stop we are not going to do that we can change how we compare ourselves to others in ways that end up using less energy and materials and i think there's zillions of ways for pilots and examples of young people and young people already my students a lot of them don't even have driver's licenses because they they don't want to buy a car not because they're doing the right thing for the planet but the economic circumstances are they can't afford it and so i think this is going to evolve and what do we what will be the things that are really cool culturally i want to be like them well in your in my lifetime that's the ferrari and the fancy house and the corporate jet or whatever that's going to change because it's going to have to change and i think we can all play a role in what that might look ([Time 1:09:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62ecf903504ebb000900cd41?annotationId=62ed030c7c39e60009d8ad21))
