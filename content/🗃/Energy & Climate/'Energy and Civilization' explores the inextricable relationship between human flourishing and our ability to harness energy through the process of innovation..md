- 'Energy and Civilization' explores the inextricable relationship between human flourishing and our ability to harness energy through the process of innovation. 
  A thread on the role of energy in agriculture, transportation, communication, and urbanization.

- "While the transition from foraging to farming cannot be explained solely by energetic imperatives, the evolution of agriculture can be seen as a continuing effort to raise land productivity in order to accommodate larger populations."

- "all traditional agricultures shared the same energetic foundation. They were powered by photosynthetic conversion of solar radiation, producing food for people, feed for animals, recycled wastes for replenishing soil fertility, and fuels for smelting metals [for] simple tools"

- "farming sustained higher pop. densities, but it also demanded higher energy expenditures..for critical supportive measures as the digging of wells, the building of irrigation canals, roads, and food storage structures, and the terracing of fields."

- "higher yields [required] three essential advances."
  1. partial replacement of human labor by animal labor
  2. irrigation and fertilization
  3. crop variety (multi-cropping or rotations) for resiliency ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1557120264457969664))
- "Horses are the most powerful draft animals."
  [they] have better endurance (8-10hrs/day vs. cattle 4-6hrs/day) and live longer (15-20yrs vs. oxen 8-10yrs)

- "Continued cropping without fertilization would create nitrogen deficits.
  The organic fertilizer with the highest content is 'guano', droppings of seabirds preserved along the Peruvian coast. 
  Imports to the U.S. began in 1824 and to England in 1840."

- "Modern farming is dominated by monocultures. They need fertilizers to replace the removed nutrients, as well as chemicals to control pests, which thrive on vast uniform plantings.
  Long experience taught many ancient cultivators the perils of monocultures."

- "The limits to population density in societies undergoing agricultural involution were reached by the ability to subsist on gradually diminishing per capita returns of human labor.
  These gains became eventually limited by the maximum possibilities of nitrogen recycling."

- "Only the input of fossil energiesâ€”directly as fuels and electricity, and indirectly as in agricultural chemicals and machineryâ€”could sustain both an expanding population and a higher per capita supply of food.
  There would be no complex cultures without high pop. densities." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/anilsaidso/status/1557120274666926080))
- "The transition to fossil fuels has entailed two fundamental qualitative improvements:

- "But seam engines became victims of their own success [and] they began to encounter their inherent limitations. 
  Even after more than a century of improvements the most commonly used steam engines..wasted 92% of coal fed into its boiler.
