The sovereignty of individual is the deepest truth I can currently conceive of and can't reason any deeper. I almost have to take a leap of faith and believe that each one of use is made in the image of God, as it sets the very fundamental for our sovereign existence.

To be valued both by ourselves and by others, is an undeniable instinct we all share and the basis of how we conduct our lives. We like to live as if we're something of value and we like it when others validate that ideas, and others will find us respectful only when we treat them the same way.

Free will or not, we as humans like to live as if we're conscious agency of our being. We certainly don't like to be devalued as if we're merely objects or means to an end, that's when we'll feel used, taken advantage of, lied to, and betrayed.

Almost universally, the ideal life we can possibly imagine for ourselves consists of something involving appreciation and care from our family, validation and recognition for our work, cherishment and love from our partners, and affirmation and respect for ourselves. This is the very instinct we live of, and the ideal we live towards.

So it's undeniable that one of, if not the very thing we want in our life, is to be valued as a human being, in whatever way we individually desire. Being valued as an individual can give us tremendous meaning and help us get through significant amount of hardships, which is why the voluntarily adoption of responsibility is one of the quickest way to cultivate drive and meaning for your life.

This is why in our daily life, we should not only view ourselves as individuals as values and not accept ourselves to be used (to be enslaved by other's emotions or actions), but should also be wary not to reduce any person's individuality down to his/her look, race, gender, opinion, action, and belief. As tempting as it is to do so, by fighting this lazy and irresponsible attempt to reduce people into less than who they are and dehumanize them, we form a much stronger basis for public discussion, social affair, mutual understanding, genuine and trustful interaction on all levels. This is a moral pillar for a strong and stable society.

So this leads us to why watching porn is wrong - and I'm mainly talking about the act of watching people have sex for one's own pleasure - is because this act is equivalent to exploiting the performers for one's own usage and reduces them to merely objects for certain means. Watching porn is not wrong because sex and body are sinful, but this the very act we should avoid as it's wrong in and of itself, whether or not the performer likes it or if it's hurting anyone.

And so there's no more dangerous idea than what some people might think 'humans as parasites on earth'. Such view might come from the care for the environment as well as the pessimistic view for humanity, but it's nonetheless a catastrophic idea. Such idea is not only not helpful (should we just line people up and shoot them? tell people to quit having children?), but itself degrades the value of the person promoting it, which is why it's catastrophic - it's an idea that can bring demise to the very person withholding it. And that's precisely what many mass shooter did - when one REALLY believes there to be no value in humanity and its existence, the most logical act would be to kill as many people as possible before one commit suicide.

That leads us to suicide. Imagine the ideal life we talked about where your value is appreciated, now consider the opposite direction, where a person is totally not valued. Despite there're many other complex reasons why people lead to suicidal thoughts,

...The very suicide attempt is the doing (direct result) of the circumstances in which the person is not valued, so the only real self-conscious decision in the midst of it would be to stand up and live as if you're a valuable individual. Do not let the whole self destructing circumstance consume you into nothingness, which is what the darkness of this world can sometimes do to people.

Key foundation that pro-life arguments are based on: Value of a living being (human) is based on the potential (human-ness) that one possesses, not on whether one can express that fully at a given moment.

The same can be said to those with brain damage (or even brain dead) or seriously ill. People will do what they can to hold on to these loved ones in the hope of them being well again - to realize the potential of being a human in this world again. It seems somewhat illogical or cruel to disregard that part of a embryo just because it hasnâ€™t have the chance to prove its capacity of human-ness and establish a relationship with anyone, yet.

However, how do we determine which potential is greater? The motherâ€™s potential without carrying this unwanted child, or the potential of both of them living, or even the potential of the child at the expense of sacrificing the motherâ€™s life if needed? In different period of the human history we seemed to have different answers, and Iâ€™m not so sure how to answer this one at this moment, and Iâ€™m quite certain this answer is unanswerable.

For the most part Iâ€™d still suppot a society with minimal interference of peopleâ€˜s live from the government and I do not trust governments for achieving greater goods for most citizens (as I do believe in the sovereignty of individualâ€˜s choices) and I do want to stay away from authoritarian regime of most kinds. Iâ€™d still propose a free, libertarianism socieity with minimal interference from the governments but with high moral standards of the people - having the shared sense of responsibility of the people goes hand-in-hand with the optimized freedom.
## Highlights
- > On Pro-choice position: 
	- it comes down to autonomy. we are a culture obsessed with autonomy, obsessed with choice and control. so people in support of abortion would argue that it's about my bodily autonomy, my right to control my body, and therefore if I want to have an abortion which is something that involves my body being laid down on the abortionist table then I should be allowed to access that ([TimeÂ 0:13:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8173439485f00095eff85))

- > It's not only the woman's body: 
	- we know that it is not just the woman's body that's involved when she has an abortion. when a woman takes a pregnancy test and she's not yet seen the results and but she doesn't want to be pregnant, if the test comes negative, will she go to an abortion clinic?  obviously not. But if the test comes up positive and she doesn't want to be pregnant, will she then consider going to the abortion clinic? yes. 
	- what is it that the positive test is telling her versus what the negative test is telling? the negative test is basically saying: it's just your body, don't worry it's just you, but the moment she has a positive pregnancy test, that's telling her it's no longer just her body, there's another body there, that's why she's thinking about going to the abortion clinic, an action she would never take if she had the negative test. 
	- so the very fact that she's now going to the abortion clinic is an admission there's another body present so what about that body's bodily autonomy? what about that individuals choice? the choice I could make to lay my body down on the abortionist table is a choice that if I'm pregnant is going to impact another body and if I believe in bodily rights and I need to protect the bodily rights of that pre born human being ([TimeÂ 0:15:19](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8178639485f00095eff86))
	- so all of the physiological reactions a woman has when she's pregnant, is because of the presence of another body, therefore if there's another body then how do we treat that other body, how ought we treat that other body, and that's actually an important distinction. it's not what can I do, the question is what **should** I do. I can do almost anything yes, the question is should I do that in a civil society, in a society that believes all humans are equal, in a society that believes in the fundamental human right to life? ([TimeÂ 0:17:50](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b817c739485f00095eff87))


- > On the cases of sexual assault:
	-  there's two approaches that we need to take: there's the approach of the heart and the approach of the head. we need to start with the former, we need to acknowledge that anyone who's been victimized by sexual assault has been victimized, that they've been traumatized, that is a brutal assault for which there really aren't words to capture how vile it is. while I can't say I've personally experienced it I have observed through friendship the impact that has had on people who have personally experienced that, and I can acknowledge that is a terrible thing, and those people who have been hurt need our support, they need our love, our compassion, and counseling, and so on and so forth. 
	- the question we then need to ask moving from the heart to the head, so there's an expression of sympathy and then this introduction of logic: will abortion un-raped a rape victim? will it undo the trauma? will it take away the evil that is happening ([TimeÂ 0:19:06](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b818075007ba0009a41dba))
	- (It won't but you can remove the brutal reminder by not giving birth to the baby) 
	  so we acknowledge that there's some reminder, but we can't acknowledge that to the point to think that if we took that particular reminder away, that we'd be eliminating all other reminders, that there wouldn't be things there. 
	- the next point I would make is that I would ask the question is it fair to give the death penalty to the innocent child that's a consequence we don't even give to the rapist in America ([TimeÂ 0:20:52](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8186e39485f00095eff88))
	- generally, abortion supporters I find are not supporters of the death penalty, so these are individuals that wouldn't give the death penalty to a rapist, they wouldn't give the death penalty to a murderer. so then we ask if you won't give the death penalty to guilty people, why would you ever consider giving the death penalty to an innocent person? that in the circumstance of rape, the guilty party is not the preborn child, the guilty party is not the woman, the guilty party is the rapist. so we're now talking with the act of abortion about giving a consequence a punishment to the innocent party that we're not even giving to the guilty party, and even if we were giving that to the guilty party, I think we should all agree that no innocent person should ever paid the price of a crime that they themselves have not committed. 
	  so I would make the point that abortion is not gonna un-rape a rape victim, it is not going to take away the memories that she's been traumatized, and then most fundamentally, a society that supports human rights may not give punishment for a crime that the individual being punished has actually not committed, that they're not guilty of. ([TimeÂ 0:21:59](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b8189839485f00095eff89))
	- if you could have two women in the same country who have both committed crimes, that according to that country's law, are worthy of the death penalty. one woman is pregnant one woman is not, both of them are guilty. if only one of the two under that law is going to be killed because she's not pregnant, that's an admission that within the body of the pregnant woman is an innocent party, and we don't kill innocent people for crimes that they haven't committed. so interestingly, not only is it the existence of a preborn child that saves some mothers from being killed by the death penalty, but the point is it's an acknowledgment that in her body is an innocent party, and so we don't kill innocent people for crimes they haven't committed. ([TimeÂ 0:30:22](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81986ddbfc10009dda902))

- > On when life begins (the embryo can't feel argument):
	- Peter singer, who is a professor at Princeton University, would argue that a person is someone who's rational, conscious, or self-aware. and so the abortion supporter will say even if biologically you're human - the embryo in the first few weeks of pregnancy, even the fetus in the first trimester and so forth - they will say well that entity is not rational, conscious, or self-aware in that moment. therefore even if it's biologically a human, it is not a person. 
	- well if our definition of a person, which is what gives you the right to life and what stops me from being able to kill you, is being rational, conscious, or self aware, what about when you're having surgery and you're under anaesthetic in that moment? you're not rational, conscious, or self-aware, if surgery is happening and I look at you and I say can I kill you, you're not going to respond back and say "no please don't", because you're under anaesthetic. if you're sleeping and I whisper while you're sleeping "may I kill you" you're not gonna say "no please don't kill me", because you're not rational, conscious, and self aware at that moment. 
	- So the reason we still acknowledge you're a person, is because we would say by virtue of being human, you have the inherent capacity built into your human nature, to be rational, conscious, or self-aware, even though you can't currently express that due to your circumstances of sleeping or being under anaesthetic. 
	- in the same way, by virtue of being human, the embryo or fetus of human parents has within his or her nature, the capacity to be rational, conscious, or self-aware, but cannot currently express that because of her age. when you're sleeping, you can't express it, because of your circumstances, and that can change quickly. in the embryos case, the embryo may not express it because of the embryos age, which will change as the embryo gets older but our right to life ought to be grounded in our existence, not in how old we are.  the embryo cannot act on certain abilities because of the embryos age, yet human rights aren't based on age, they're based on existence as a member of the human family ([TimeÂ 0:24:07](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b818e2ddbfc10009dda900))
	- (But as a person, I've expressed my capacity to be rational, conscious, and self-aware before, that's not the case for an embryo as it hasn't shown any of that. )
	  so the fact that you have experienced being rational conscious and self-aware right now and then you might lose that ability to currently act on that if you're under anesthetic if you're sleeping and then you're going to come out of those situations and act again the fact that you've previously had this experience why does that matter in contrast to the embryo who has not yet had that experience why is that relevant I would ask the abortion supporter to articulate why ([TimeÂ 0:26:40](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81904548ef0000979697f))
	- so I would say the point is that, it is wrong to kill a human, not because the human feels pain at the time of killing, not because the human is aware at the time of killing, but because the individual being killed is a human. and so whether the preborn child feels pain or not, is aware or not, can respond or not, isn't relevant. what's relevant is this child is a member of the human family. 
	- that's why with abortion supporters, I like to use a reference from the United Nations, which is often perceived as being a pro-abortion institution, but if you look at their foundational documents, they are profoundly pro-life. the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says: all members of the human family have the right to life. and then they say in article 6: everyone ought to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law. well, who's everyone? well the preamble talks about "all members of the human family", so since the preborn child is a member of the human family by virtue of having human parents, than article 6 applies to them as much as it applies to you and me, that by being members of the human family they ought to be recognized as persons everywhere before the law ([TimeÂ 0:28:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81957ddbfc10009dda901))


- > Answering the "Violinist Argument", 
	- ("A Defense of Abortion" is a moral philosophy essay by Judith Jarvis Thomson first published in Philosophy & Public Affairs in 1971.) 
	- On the subject of consent (majority of cases)
		- first of all, there is a difference between the pregnancy in which a woman, in the vast majority of cases, has consented to the act of sex that brought about to the pregnancy, and the minority of cases where it's not. 
		- so in the case of the violinist, you were kidnapped and plugged into this person without your consent. but for the vast majority of circumstances where women are pregnant, they've consented to the act of sex. and since pregnancy is a possible consequence, they have to accept that.
		- Like if you play baseball with your child in the street, and your son hits the ball and it goes through your neighbor's window, you can't say to your neighbor: I only consent to play baseball but I didn't consent to the ball going through your window, so I'm not going to pay for your window to be fixed. if your neighbor took you to small claims court, he would be able to argue that by virtue of playing baseball in an area where there was glass, there was an inherent risk associated with that of breaking someone's window, and by entering into the game you have to embrace the consequence and therefore pay to fix the window. ([TimeÂ 0:35:37](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81a38ebdd6f000afe490a))
		- Or when you have to pay child support: so imagine a couple have sex and sometimes later they break up, the woman finds out she's pregnant and ask the man to pay child support. If the woman wants to carry through with the pregnancy when the baby's born and then later realizes she needs some financial help, she goes to do paternity tests he finds out he is indeed the biological father, and she says you owe me child support. now imagine if he came back and said "hey I consented to the sex, but I sure didn't consent to this pregnancy, so I'm not paying for child support." if she takes him to court over this matter, the court will rule in her favor that, by virtue of engaging in the act of sex and creating this human being that he has to accept the consequences, which is the existence of a human being who's vulnerable and needy and requires financial provision and therefore he has a duty to pay child support, so if we expect that of the men shouldn't we expect that of the women. ([TimeÂ 0:38:08](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81a86776a6b0009c73429))
		- parents have a responsibility to their offspring that we don't have to strangers. so the nature of me being in bed with the violinist, is I don't know this person, so it's nice of me to use my body to help them but there's no obligation, there's no moral duty to do that, and that is the difference: when it comes to pregnancies, it's a parent-child relationship. 
	- On cases where it wasn't consented (sexual assault and such)
		- this is then where we can deal with those exceptions, where someone hasn't consented in the case of sexual assault and nonetheless gets pregnant. while they haven't consented to the act that brought about the pregnancy, by virtue of being the parent of the child biologically - the rape victim is the mother of the offspring parents - have a responsibility to care for their offspring in a way they don't have a responsibility for strangers. so if a child is starving in your city it's nice of you to go to a homeless shelter and work to provide food, but if you don't volunteer at a homeless shelter to help starving children or adults, you're not going to be found guilty of breaking a law. but if your child in your home is starving and you're refusing to feed your child, you will be found legally and morally responsible for neglection. ([TimeÂ 0:39:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81aaf776a6b0009c7342a))
		- I think it's to say that we have a duty to help the vulnerable. what makes rape wrong is that you have a vulnerable party who is attacked by a stronger party; what makes abortion wrong, is that you have a vulnerable party that is attacked by a stronger party - that is in no way intended to minimize the gravity or the trauma of a sexual assault, it's to simply make the point that when injustice happens, when terrible things happen, it doesn't give the victims license to do just anything in response. 
		- I would argue that a victim of sexual assault who becomes pregnant doesn't have to raise the child. the question is in a certain window of time, where no one else can care for the child, is there a responsibility to meet the basic needs of the child? 
		- so again, by way of analogy, we could imagine that you're kidnapped alongside a newborn baby. you were knocked out and then you wake up in a cabin which is locked, there's no way of getting out and you're in the middle of nowhere. and you discovered that you're kidnapped with a child who's of no relation to you and in this cabin. interestingly, there is formula, there's water, and there are bottles. in such case, it's not really a great kind of heroic virtue for me to support this child right there. even though you've been a victim of kidnapping, it's "unfortunately" also your duty to meet the basic needs of this child, who's incapable of meeting those needs, and who's unrelated to you, just because it's a the right thing to do. Then when you're freed hopefully from this situation, you don't have to go on and raise the child.
		- now the abortion supporter might then say well then if you have to help the child in the cabin in the woods where you're both kidnapped, shouldn't you have to help the violinist? because you're not related to the child and you're not related to the violinist. so then it comes down to our basic or ordinary needs, versus extraordinary needs - in the case of the violinist needing to be plugged into my body. ([TimeÂ 0:41:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81b12776a6b0009c7342b))
	- More on the topic of basic vs extraordinary needs (a twist on the violinist argument)
		- imagine that you are a parent and you have a born child. you love your child, who suddenly gets very sick because of kidney disease and is going to die, unless your child gets a kidney transplant, from whom you're the only person in the world with the right body type. So would it be nice of you - the parent - to give one of your kidneys to your child? yes, it would be nice. would it save your child's life? yes. would it kill you knowing that you've got two? no. but then should the law force a pyramid to give their kidney to their child?
		- So apparently when it comes to organ donation that there isn't a moral obligation to donate ones organs. it can be an act of generosity and the right circumstances, but it's not a moral duty. and so just as a parent should not have a legal duty to give their born child their kidney, a parent in the case of the mother, should not have a legal duty to give her preborn child her uterus. ([TimeÂ 0:44:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81b5335745d0009a46310))
		- (Response) the question we have to ask ourselves is, what is the nature and purpose of the kidney, versus the nature and purpose of the uterus? because when we ask and answer that question, we come to see why a parent should not be legally obligated to give one but actually should be legally obligated to give the other. I'd say the kidney exists in my body, for my body, but the uterus is very different. the uterus exists in my body, every single month getting ready for someone else's body, every single month my uterine lining is thickening in great expectation for the implantation of the next generation. therefore, you could say the uterus is unique from all the other body parts, in that it exists more for my offspring then for me, and they can therefore claim a right to that in contrary to the born child who can't claim a right to get your kidney. ([TimeÂ 0:47:00](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81b8a548ef00009796980))
		- there is a parental responsibility for you - the parent - to meet the basic needs of your offspring. for a child to be taken to Disneyland, that's an extraordinary need, it's not an ordinary thing. but food, clothing, shelter, that's ordinary care. and so in the case of pregnancy, maintaining a pregnancy, allowing the uterus to be used - for the very nature of the uterus exists for is the food, clothing, and shelter - so to speak - for the preborn child - that's needed at that stage of one's offspring.
		- so I would argue that because the parent-child relationship, because the nature of the uterus, because it's basic care, you have to care for the child. when it comes to the violinist, that's above and beyond the call of duty, here's of course extraordinary, versus the child in the cabin that's feeding a child who's not related to you, that's ordinary care, and then the added element is if you're the parent, even more so. ([TimeÂ 0:48:39](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81bd4ebdd6f000afe490b))

- What if the mother's life is in danger?
	- > what distinguishes women in general from mothers specifically - they have offspring. therefore we know now to be a mother, involves the presence of another, and it involves a very special relationship - one of nurture and care for the more vulnerable party. 
	- starting with that, then I would say okay, in this scenario you've described, this is cause for concern. in terms of figuring out how to tackle this concern, the beginning place has to be two lives are involved - the mother and the child - and we have two valuable lives equally, we recognize both are unrepeatable and irreplaceable ( both are willed and loved in the eyes of God). the mother isn't more important than the child,  the child is not more important than the mother, they're both equal. 
	- but we also recognize that one party is more vulnerable: the younger preborn child that that child is actually dependent on the mother - equal to but dependent on the mother. so if we want to preserve the child's life for a good portion of the pregnancy, we actually need to preserve the mother's life. so that would be the general information I would propose at the beginning.
	- Then I would say, in order to determine how we ought to respond, we can acknowledge that there are some paths we could take that are immoral and although those aren't open to us, it doesn't mean that there aren't other paths we could take that would be moral. 
	- for example imagine you're driving home and there's a big orange sign up that says road closed, detour ahead. you'd be like ok, then you follow these arrows that take you all around a neighborhood you normally don't go through to ultimately get home. do you still get home? yes but not the way you normally take, that option wasn't open to you. you still reached your final destination, but you went around or a longer path. so in the same way I would say, when the woman's life is in danger, we want to reach that end goal of saving her life, but "road close, detour ahead" - the one path that is not open to us is the path that would involve directly and intentionally coding the child's life, because it's wrong to directly and intentionally end the life of an innocent. ([TimeÂ 0:53:47](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b8163e8e6255000a01f95a?annotationId=62b81c82548ef00009796981))


- More on when life begins (we don't know when)
	- when people say they don't know when life begins, I then ask question back: "out of curiosity, when do you ban abortion?" and wherever they ban abortion, I would say "well isn't that when you think life begins". if they ban abortion at six months of pregnancy, or at birth, then they must be acknowledging life begins there,  otherwise they wouldn't ban abortion there. so then you show them they're claiming they don't know when life begins, but they are asserting they do know by drawing the line for banning abortion. 
	- So then the question is on what basis do you have for life's beginning? at six months? or does life begin at birth? even if you look at the number six months, that label for us to get there "six months" implies that we think something significant happened six months ago that cause us to count passage of time, that caused us to look at the clock ticking "oh we got to six months". well if fertilization is what happened six months ago, isn't that when life begins? if fertilization happened three months ago instead of drawing the line at three months, wouldn't it be three months ago that life begins at the moment of sperm egg fusion? if someone were to say well I don't know when to ban abortion because I truly don't know when life begins, then I would say two things: one I would give them the science for life beginning at fertilization, but two I would say if we don't know, shouldn't we err on the side of caution?
	- if you're going to blow up an old building, you've got your dynamite all around, you're about to do an implosion, but someone says "I don't know if everyone's out of the building there, could be someone still inside here" do you just say "but let's blow it up anyways" or do you err on the side of caution and say "we're not gonna blow this building up until we're sure so to say".
	- "I don't know when life begins" is different than saying there is no life here. if someone cannot declaratively say there is no life here, but instead they're like I just don't know then they actually might need to err on the side of caution, and say well if we don't know if there's a chance then we need to err on that side.

	- There is a scientific paper, written by a physician and scientific researcher dr. Maureen Kondik, who wrote a paper called "when does human life begin". in that paper, she makes an amazing case for life beginning at fertilization.
	- she makes the case this way: she says when scientists have a bunch of cells and they want to know are these cells all the same type or are they different, she said scientist two criteria: they look at cell composition, and cell behavior. so in other words what does it make up of, and what does it do. 
	- and so she said when you look at a sperm cell, what's its composition? the genetic material of the father. when you look at an egg, what's its composition? the genetic material of the mother. so already with sperm and egg we know they're different cells, because of composition.
	- she said now let's look at behavior: when a sperm is in existence and alive, it swims to find an egg and fertilize it. that's the behavior of a sperm - seek out an egg and penetrate it an egg. what is the behavior of an egg? it's to sit around and allow for penetration to occur. so by behavior, we can see the sperm cell in the egg cell are different from each other. by composition they're different from each other -> therefore different cells. 
	- let's look at that criteria in light of the one celled embryo or zygote is that embryo or zygote same thing? the one-celled embryo, is that individual cell different from the sperm and the egg by composition and behavior? yes, here's how we know. 
	- when you have the embryo even before the chromosomes have intermingled because that takes time, and so at the moment of sperm egg fusion, when you have the sperms head which has gone into the egg you now in that entity have the composition of the mother and the father, the genetic material of both the chromosomes haven't intermingled, but they're all contained in that one cell, so by composition we know we're dealing with something different.
	- then let's look at behavior. if you look at one embryo, the moment a sperm has penetrated an egg, and you have the embryo. if another sperm comes along what happens is it allowed to penetrate, no it can't because this zone is created around the embryo that prevents penetration from happening. now if that was the egg cell it would allow penetration, if it was a sperm it would be swimming around. so by virtue of looking at composition and behavior of the embryo, we see it's different from the sperm cell or the egg cell. 
	- so we know that something substantively new has come into existence that we didn't have prior to sperm egg fusion, and that new thing is the offspring, the next generation of the parents. therefore if we believe parents have responsibility to their children since we have a new child genetically distinct from mum and dad, then we ought to protect that child from that point forward.

On why'd we save the one baby instead of 20 embryos in the midst of fire
	two reasons: one we might feel more affection - just natural affection - for the child, that we've perhaps even held or comforted or played with. but two, there's a part of it is an analysis of success. 
	almost like a triage situation, where it's like if I grab this child and I get the child out of the building, I've not only saved this child in this instant, but this child is gonna keep living, so I have the likelihood of success in removing this child from the building. I don't have that likelihood of success when I run out of the building with with 20 frozen embryos, because first of all I don't want them to thaw or they're gonna die, but if I'm taking the the canister out of the building, does it need to be plugged into something so are they gonna die in the process of removing? even if I can somehow use a generator - or whatever is needed to keep them in their frozen state, when they're out of the building then what do I have a likely to success? will they be implanted, should they be implanted that's a whole other ethical dilemma? is it ethical to implant embryos in other human beings who are not they're their biological parents? and so part of it could be, beyond the emotional connection, the likelihood of success of actually saving lives. 
	so once you start to break down the scenario, you realize this isn't a case for abortion. Inability to save is not the same as direct killing, and it's certainly not saying that if I don't save you that you're not equal to the one I saved.
