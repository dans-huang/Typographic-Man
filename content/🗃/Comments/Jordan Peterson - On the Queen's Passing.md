- > the thing about the monarchy that's so cool you know in the united states there's the judiciary and the legislative branch and the executive that separation of powers and the checks and balances that are part and parcel of that and that's a bright system and then you also have the states and they have their power against the federal government and that stops anything from becoming too tyrannical in principle ([TimeÂ 0:05:25](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c02a07d903800093afdb9))
- > but here and in canada although less so in canada because we're you know modern and trying to dispense with the monarchy modern confused dim-witted and untraditional um and casual and careless and then we have the french english problem which makes things more complicated on the monarchical front you have four divisions you have executive legislative judicial and symbolic and the monarch holds the symbolic weight and that's really smart because it separates it to some degree from the political weight you know you see what happens in the united states is well first of all is the president tends to turn into this to the czar you know because they have this idea in the united states now like first lady it's like what the hell is that we don't have that in canada nobody knows anything about about justin trudeau's wife and that's been the history of of canadian politicians it's like just because you're justin trudeau's wife doesn't mean you're queen but in the united states it's like well you know hillary clinton maybe she's queen and that's and that's partly because there is that demand for the symbolic weight that the leader should manifest and you also see that to some degree in the united states which is a star worshiping culture obviously with the glitterati and the royalty of hollywood and it's better put there it's better put there in the entertainment section even though that's also somewhat dangerous because it tends to elevate actors into pronouncements of ethical ver pronouncers of ethical virtues say but better there than in the political realm trump he's like king and president all rolled up into one and that's just too much and so and so i really admire the monarchical system and i think that for whatever reason the uk has done a wonderful job of maintaining that and ([TimeÂ 0:05:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c02fb0d030d0009c3c528))
- > i know the economic analysis indicate that the royal family generates way more income than they spend you know because they're a major and everything they're associated with here's a major tourist attraction it's this tradition that you have here this monarchical tradition is something that's tremendously attractive to people who don't have that canadians for example americans and because it's it's just it's so theatrical and so unique and then you had queen elizabeth who man i mean that's quite the woman there what how many 13 prime ministers and so you had someone around to intimidate all your prime ministers that's a really good idea and i'm sure she did a fine job of that you know ([TimeÂ 0:07:43](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c03240d030d0009c3c529))
- > you can imagine how useful it was psychologically in some sense for the prime minister who has monarchical temptations in some sense like trump did to have to go on a regular basis to this remarkable person who'd seen this immense span of political history and confess in some real sense right and to be subject to her cautious and wise judgment because i think she was a woman who was traditional and cautious and wise in the highest degree and there were scandals in her family but like you have a family if people knew what your family was doing don't you think there'd be scandals and so but she was remarkably free of scandals over that entire period and that's that's a hell of a thing to manage for 70 years ([TimeÂ 0:08:34](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c03470d030d0009c3c52a))
- > maybe you'll get lucky and maybe your monarch and maybe with your support will rise to the occasion and your country and the rest of the british commonwealth will recognize that what they have in the shared bonds that unite them based on english common law and the great democratic tradition that's so much a function of this country and this country really in particular i mean you're the birthplace of both canada the us australia new zealand india these amazing countries these free democratic productive generous societies it's quite the accomplishment and i see in england and europe but in england too in great britain such a such apprehension about that such refusal to note the greatness of your country and its contributions i mean you know no one in the united states ever talks about the fact that the uk was the country that er that eradicated slavery like that's that only happened once in the whole history of the of the human race you know when your country did it it took 175 years and a huge economic yeah you know it was it was your country and the great people who were were spearheading that movement at the time that established once and for all on the political and economic front that that was not to be tolerated and then you know it took a while for that idea to spread everywhere it still hasn't because there's there's plenty of slaves in the world the estimate's 30 million at the moment by the way but there are very few people who will come out forthrightly and say that it's that it's right that it's okay that you know might makes right and your country was definitely one of the moral forces in the world the primary moral force on the political front who established once and for all that that was no longer acceptable and so and and and and yet mostly what characterizes a fair bit of self-image in great britain is shame and you know every country has things to be ashamed of but not every country also has things to be proud of ([TimeÂ 0:10:05](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c03cc7d903800093afdba))
- > maybe we'll wise up and recognize that we have something absolutely precious to guard and uh and then maybe we'll guard it but to do that we're going to have to defend ourselves against unwarranted accusations of of guilt not that there's not something to be guilty about you know because we're all the beneficiaries of the atrocities of history and we have to atone for that in our personal behavior but by the same token man you're supposed to separate the wheat from the chaff and not just call it all chaff and when you look at your own history you think we stumbled plenty you know but we still walked up hill and you in your country you can say that more than most you  ([TimeÂ 0:12:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/631c02540d030d0009c3c3a6?annotationId=631c04057d903800093afdbb))
