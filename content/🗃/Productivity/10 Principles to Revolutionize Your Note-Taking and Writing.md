# Zettelkasten
- turning one‚Äôs thoughts into writing isn‚Äôt just useful for writers but for anyone who wants to improve their thinking and learning in general. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq9f0zzy5mrbs4vaykz1syr))
- ![](https://i0.wp.com/fortelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unnamed-1-1.png?resize=512%2C233&ssl=1) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq9mj47q44h1vy5tqrtjaxr))
- Not only did this create a system that could extend infinitely in any direction, but it also gave each index card a permanent ID number. This number could be referenced from any other card, because it would never change. The branches created ‚Äústrands‚Äù of thought that one could enter at any point, following it downstream to be elaborated upon or upstream to its source. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa4bxf0pf0ee3c22gbje5m))
- Topics that had been extensively explored had long reference numbers, making their length informative on its own. There is no hierarchy in the zettelkasten, which means it can grow internally without any preconceived scheme. By creating notes as a decentralized network instead of a hierarchical tree, Luhmann anticipated hypertext and URLs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa74epyjtfj78shj7ks7xb))
- Luhmann often remarked that he never forced himself to do anything he didn‚Äôt feel like doing: ‚ÄúI only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else‚Äù (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa93pb78g1d31ssapbhm2j))
  
# Principle #1: **Writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in which thinking takes place** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqa9qtzk635ta2cbjgr5y3s))
- Writing is not only for proclaiming fully formed opinions, but for developing opinions worth sharing in the first place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaankbbry0kqc6shetygwb))
- **Writing works well in improving one‚Äôs thinking because it forces you to engage with what you‚Äôre reading on a deeper level.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqab7pgn488s8fmnqrkf7k0))
  
# Principle #2: **Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqac48cmwsca1k141d5t21d))
- ‚Äúthere is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. **An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.**‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqactqcr87kjgk24b1mn47a))
- **The purpose of research is to produce *public* knowledge that can be scrutinized and tested. For that to happen, it has to be written down. And once it is, what the author meant doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äì only the actual words written on the page matter.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqadasr986zh7bhcypfbk0b))
- This principle requires us to expand our definition of ‚Äúpublication‚Äù beyond the usual narrow sense. Few people will ever publish their work in an academic journal or even on a blog. But everything that we write down and share with someone else counts: notes we share with a friend, homework we submit to a professor, emails we write to our colleagues, and presentations we deliver to clients all count as knowledge made public. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaevaxegd7gcy4r8wyhyj8))
- Having a clear, tangible purpose when you consume information completely changes the way you engage with it. You‚Äôll be more focused, more curious, more rigorous, and more demanding. You won‚Äôt waste time writing down every detail, trying to make a perfect record of everything that was said. Instead, you‚Äôll try to learn the basics as efficiently as possible so you can get to the point where open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqafaghrrp1n15x8bk9ty0g))
- **Almost every aspect of your life will change when you live as if you are working toward publication.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqafq00t6b9a99e8q3wb0h9))
  
# Principle #3: **Nobody ever starts from scratch** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqagwv2k6etbs5qt4qd1zqv))
- No one ever really starts from scratch. Anything they come up with has to come from prior experience, research, or other understanding. But because they haven‚Äôt acted on this fact, they can‚Äôt track ideas back to their origins. They have neither supporting material nor accurate sources. Since they haven‚Äôt been taking notes from the start, they either have to start with something completely new (which is risky) or retrace their steps (which is boring). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqangmv60kzmpc64dth2yqy))
  
# Principle #4: **Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqaqttfpmw69hrdqk9rf6ee))
- It is only when all the work becomes part of an integrated process that it becomes more than the sum of its parts. Even the best techniques won‚Äôt make a difference if they are used in conflicting ways. This is why the slip-box isn‚Äôt yet another technique. It is the system in which all the techniques are linked together. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqarvqzvb9ra4p4c5yxnrtq))
- Good systems don‚Äôt add options and features; they strip away complexity and distractions from the main work, which is thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqas8ezgww0f6zxbg402prn))
  
# Principle #5: Standardization enables creativity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqas9kfa0bybhepzh02y656))
  
# Principle #6: Our work only gets better when exposed to high-quality feedback ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqavzdahgzsn4b5cya1xxnm))
  
# Principle #7: Work on multiple, simultaneous projects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqb152btdnc9v5rtqxp44mt))
  
# Principle #8: Organize your notes by context, not by topic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqbtcby6kr33gy74j5w2wer))
- The classic mistake is to organize them into ever more specific topics and subtopics. This makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes overwhelming. The more notes pile up, the smaller and narrower the subtopics become, limiting your ability to see meaningful connections between them. With this approach, the greater one‚Äôs collection of notes, the less accessible and useful they become. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc219hmj40j3ppwwq6w04g))
- Instead of organizing by topic and subtopic, it is much more effective to organize by *context*. Specifically, the *context in which it will be used*. The primary question when deciding where to put something becomes ‚ÄúIn which context will I want to stumble upon this again?‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc26zqdwdd5cfd2qv3w4rj))
- In other words, instead of filing things away according to where they came from, **you file them according to where they‚Äôre going**. This is the essential difference between organizing *like a librarian* and organizing *like a writer*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc2acfkdgmj6n85jz3nscr))
- A writer asks ‚Äú**In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note?**‚Äù They will file it under a paper they are writing, a conference they are speaking at, or an ongoing collaboration with a colleague. These are concrete, near-term deliverables and not abstract categories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc50nncgnbpnd7s6hf8zch))
- Writers don‚Äôt think about a single, ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù location for a piece of information. They deal in ‚Äúscraps‚Äù which can often be repurposed and reused elsewhere. The discarded byproducts from one piece of writing may become the essential pillars of the next one. **The slip-box is a thinking tool, not an encyclopedia, so completeness is not important. The only gaps we do need to be concerned about are the gaps in the final manuscript we are working toward.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc8deegk55cb15njwc5zph))
  
# Principle #9: Always follow the most interesting path ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc98ptm5gnv1avs74cv7q5))
- ‚ÄúWhen even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it‚Äôs most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan 2006; Reeve 2009).‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqc9zzw2kvr9vx61zestkey))
- **This is why we must spend as much time as possible working on things we find interesting. It is not an indulgence. It is an essential part of making our work sustainable and thus successful.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqca9fgm057w0xsh0vy4rwk))
- This advice runs counter to the typical approach to planning we are taught. We are told to ‚Äúmake a plan‚Äù upfront and in detail. Success is then measured by how closely we stick to this plan. Our changing interests and motivations are to be ignored or suppressed if they interfere with the plan. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcax3j087cgmw15pp2p7q6))
- **Plans are meant to help us feel in control. But it is much more important to actually *be* in control, which means being able to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcbev2hf3eehwtdcaccc8g))
- According to a 2006 study by psychology professor Arlen Moller, ‚ÄúWhen people experienced a sense of autonomy with regard to the choice [of what to work on], their energy for subsequent tasks was not diminished‚Äù (Moller 2006, 1034). In other words, when we have a choice about what to work on and when, it doesn‚Äôt take as much willpower to do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcc1f6755j68aa9qpwvhqj))
- Our sense of motivation depends on making consistent forward progress. But **in creative work, questions change and new directions emerge. That is the nature of insight.** So we don‚Äôt want to work according to a rigid workflow that is threatened by the unexpected. We need to be able to make small, constant adjustments to keep our interest, motivation, and work aligned. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcdz95xdxxn9277mz4cy7s))
- By breaking down the work of writing into discrete steps, getting quick feedback on each one, and always following the path that promises the most insight, unexpected insights can become the driving force of our work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqce7rdvejq13sped0ttxmz))
  
# Principle #10: Save contradictory ideas ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqceg4zwej1xfayh7rwqfz3))
- The real enemy of independent thinking is not any external authority, but our own inertia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqck7dn584m58f0m45nm069))
- By taking notes on a wide variety of sources and in objective formats that exist outside our heads, we practice the skill of seeing what is really there and describing it plainfully and factually. By saving ideas that aren‚Äôt compatible with each other and don‚Äôt necessarily support what we already think, we train ourselves to develop subtle theories over time instead of immediately jumping to conclusions.

# The 8 Steps of Taking Smart Notes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcnpn7vy7z9xpfrad458rz))
- ‚Ä¢ Make fleeting notes
  ‚Ä¢ Make literature notes
  ‚Ä¢ Make permanent notes
  ‚Ä¢ Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box
  ‚Ä¢ Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box
  ‚Ä¢ Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box
  ‚Ä¢ Turn your notes into a rough draft
  ‚Ä¢ Edit and proofread your manuscript ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcnqzj4aze793vh8dh31hn))

- Luhmann actually had *two* slip-boxes: the first was the ‚Äúbibliographical‚Äù slip-box, which contained brief notes on the content of the literature he read along with a citation of the source; the second ‚Äúmain‚Äù slip-box contained the ideas and theories he developed based on those sources. Both were wooden boxes containing paper index cards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqf1xdqm8dzfqfb66xvt3qj))

- four guidelines in creating literature notes:
	  1. Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep
	  2. Keep the overall note as short as possible
	  3. Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim
	  4. Write down the bibliographic details on the source ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcv6r6zpha7e1wscf8sadt))
- a few questions to ask yourself as you turn fleeting and literature notes into permanent notes:
	  ‚Ä¢ How does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what I already know?
	  ‚Ä¢ How can I combine ideas to generate something new?
	  ‚Ä¢ What questions are triggered by these new ideas? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqcvacgzs8rrcrfgv5h6tpy))
- Write these permanent notes as if you are writing for someone else. That is, use full sentences, disclose your sources, make explicit references, and try to be as precise and brief as possible.¬†
  Once this step is done, throw away (or delete) the fleeting notes from step one and file the literature notes from step two into your bibliographic slip-box. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpqd0fxvqkce9rbfqkt38169))
