- Imagine for a moment the perfect organizational system. One that supported and enhanced the work you do, telling you exactly where to put a piece of information, and exactly where to find it when you needed it.
  This system would have to be:
  ‚Ä¢ **universal**, encompassing any conceivable kind of information from any source
  ‚Ä¢ **flexible**, able to work with any project or activity you take on, now and in the future
  ‚Ä¢ **simple**, not requiring any time-consuming maintenance, cataloguing, tagging, or reorganizing beyond a bare minimum
  ‚Ä¢ **actionable**, integrating seamlessly with task management and project management methods
  ‚Ä¢ **cross-platform**, able to be used with any application, now existing or yet to be developed
  ‚Ä¢ **outcome-oriented**, structuring information in a way that supports the delivery of valuable work
  ‚Ä¢ **modular**, allowing different levels of detail to be hidden or revealed, depending on the needs of the current task
  ‚Ä¢ **opportunistic**, in the good sense, taking advantage of work already being performed, instead of requiring dedicated overhead time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq5vkdwptezy3gnsvfpmhxe))
- P.A.R.A. stands for **Projects‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAreas‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäResources‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäArchives**, the four top-level categories that encompass every type of information you might encounter in your work and life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq5wa0m31q4v7r7stvt4bv1))

- A **project** is ‚Äúa series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq5wvfw294dwhcrberpp8ke))
- An **area of responsibility** is ‚Äúa sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq5x19k33hjtzf4v5heywwn))
- A **resource** is ‚Äúa topic or theme of ongoing interest.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq5z1vynd1jhykf6akv3nbx))
- **Archives** include ‚Äúinactive items from the other three categories.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6167bxq7nqws4dzn6066a))

- A project has a **goal** to be achieved‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa discrete event that will happen, allowing this item to be completely checked off and struck from the list. And this goal is supposed to take place by a **specific moment in time**. It has a deadline or timeframe, whether externally or self-imposed.
  An area of responsibility, by contrast, has a **standard** to be maintained. And there is no end date or final outcome. Your performance in this area may wax and wane over time, but the standard **continues indefinitely** and requires a certain level of attention at all times.

- Projects always fall into Areas. A few examples:
  ‚Ä¢ Running a marathon is a project, whereas Health is an area
  ‚Ä¢ Publishing a book is a project, whereas Writing is an area
  ‚Ä¢ Saving 3 months‚Äô worth of expenses is a project, whereas Finances is an area
  ‚Ä¢ A vacation to Thailand is a project, whereas Travel is an area
  ‚Ä¢ Planning an anniversary dinner is a project, whereas Spouse is an area ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq63yn8mfggpst9kc20wr61))
- There are three absolutely critical things you *cannot* do unless you break out your areas of responsibility into clearly articulated projects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq65w07pg94en11nwqfmyxb))
- The first is that **you can‚Äôt truly know the extent of your commitments:** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq65xbwkswdb4zsb0nkf2j9))
- Second, **you can‚Äôt connect your current efforts to your long-term goals:** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq66pz4ypgtf5j9yvspk31e))
- Third, **you can‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre making progress toward your goals:** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6aa8wh1yzpxpmrqffhmcg))
- There is a very illuminating exercise you can perform once you‚Äôve taken the time to formulate a clear Project List. Put it side by side with your Goal List, and draw lines matching each project with its corresponding goal: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6f175yd3a22bvtkfzwq83))
- What most people find is that they don‚Äôt completely match. This is problematic because a project without a corresponding goal is known as a ‚Äúhobby.‚Äù If you‚Äôre not committed to or haven‚Äôt fully articulated the outcome you want, you must be doing it just for fun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6f65s7swzz34sd27vksdp))
- And if you have a goal without a corresponding project, that‚Äôs called a ‚Äúdream.‚Äù You may desire it with all your heart and soul, but without an active project, you are not in fact currently making any progress. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6fdjeveasw53sms75fkj3))
- The bottom line here is, **define your projects, or they will define you**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6gdyherzw1cyp5p7vp0ac))
- P.A.R.A. gives you the best of both worlds: the **consistency** of centralization, with the **adaptability** of decentralization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6j6k08zqypnm2a00kk6c2))

- The first principle is that it **uses the number 4 as a guidepost**. The entire hierarchy is **four categories wide** (projects, areas, resources, archives), and no more than **four levels deep** (using Evernote as an example, the levels would be: application > stacks > notebooks > notes). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6kbpv92fm32hb2m04fg57))
- The number four has been called ‚Äúmagic‚Äù due to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515286) indicating it seems to be the natural limit of all sorts of cognitive processes, from working memory to object-tracking to rapid enumeration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6mmnrj3tq6m12ep1f9sma))
- The second principle is that P.A.R.A. **perfectly mirrors your task management and project management systems**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq6ngy1w3t576wx3ea12r2m))
- The third principle is that P.A.R.A. preserves and actually enhances the most important distinction that any productivity system must make: **between actionable and non-actionable information**. Making this distinction allows you to set aside 95% of the information coming your way, to focus on the 5% necessary for the task at hand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq8ppe3zaxpr7pfqmsby0fb))
- By recognizing that actionability is not black or white. It is instead a gradient, a spectrum that should be hidden or revealed depending on the context. This follows a well-known design technique called *progressive disclosure*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly show the user as much information as they need in the moment. This helps minimize the cognitive load that knowledge workers must always contend with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpq8qmz090z8yyvm5vysd3t0))
