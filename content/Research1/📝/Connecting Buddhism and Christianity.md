**Space and time is an "user interface" in which humans operate. Christianity tells the story about how to live a purposeful and virtuous (creating/sustaining the wellbeing of the human community) life within this human UI, i.e. the truth WITHIN human existence. Buddhism tells the story about piercing through the limitation and illusion of this human UI to understand (not experience) the true nature of reality, i.e. the truth BEYOND human existence.**

All there is, is consciousness. Consciousness creates the brain (and the illusion of the self), not the other way around.
The capital C "Consciousness" is all there is, that is God, like in Hindu, everything in the universe is an extension of god. 
Our consciousness is essentially God playing hide and seek with itself, pretending we're not IT and not understanding who he is.
Human is created in the image of God. "Image" means we're a lesser version of whatever God - the Consciousness - is. 
We lost touch to God in our pursuit of pleasure and knowledge and power, and that's our original sin.
To redeem from our sin, we need to know the highest form of human ideal which is Jesus. Only through Jesus can we know God.
It means that, by living our lives of fractured consciousness and aiming at the highest ideal of human existence, can we get in touch again with the Self, the Consciousness, God.
Therefore, aiming to live out the most virtuous version of oneself is the way to transcend from this consciousness to THE Consciousness. 
The is the truth that Buddhism and Christianity both discovered, just from the opposite angles.

Buddhism: Impermanence & No self. Nonduality. Nothing to realize, nothing to hold on to. Self(non-self)-acceptance

Christianity: The original sins, men made in the image of god, atonement for sins and betterment of oneself, faith in god. Self-improvement.

Common ground: Sovereign individual = men made in the image of god = you're already a buddha, the brilliant light

You are (part of ) God, the progressing force of the whole universe, you're A center of the cosmos -> To act THAT out, is to atone for your sin/to honor God/to let go of yourself and live out the love and compassion (which is how God is acting through you if you let go of your ego)

A real Buddhist acts out Buddha's teaching with no judgement, no resentment, and with love and compassion. It's not passive, it's not reactive, it's a power of itself to live courageously without an ego. There's this real power behind it when you let go of the ego.

Buddha recognizes the original sins/ignorance of people, thus we need to bear the burden of suffering. To stop the suffering, you need to be actively acting out the correct ways of being in order to cease to suffer. This is just like hoe Jesus taught us to act according to god's will so we can transcend from our original sins.

Christianity provides a clear framework with powerful story to show case how an individual needs to carry his own cross and transcend his sins. Buddhism provides the day-to-day methodologies to help us find the God-ness in our hearts through the eightfold path. Christianity focuses more on the stories and the teaching in them, and provide less concrete method/training to the masses for them to practice their mind. Buddhism is less illustrative with their stories but very detailed in the methodologies and practices, but it can be easily overwhelming as there're simply too many classics in Buddhism that provides infinite amount of information for a normal practitioner to digest.
