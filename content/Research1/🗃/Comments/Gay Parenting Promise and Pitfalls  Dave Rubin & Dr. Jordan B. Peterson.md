- > 在某些方面，婚姻是兩個人的結合，但在更根本的方面，它是兩個人的結合，為孩子們提供基礎，我想說，這實際上是最重要的，我們的社會傾向於把它顛倒過來，我們傾向於認為婚姻是這樣的，當你找到適合你的伴侶時，你從此幸福地生活，不完全是，但也許是，如果你也明白，從此幸福地生活意味著在許多方面為其他人生活，特別是你的孩子。
  in some ways marriage is the union of two people but in a possibly more fundamental way it's the union of two people to provide the foundation for children right and i would say that's actually paramount i mean our society tends to flip that around and we tend to think of marriage as something that while you find the partner right for you 11:30and you live happily ever after no not exactly, or maybe exactly if you also understand that living happily ever after means living for other people in many ways particularly your children ([Time 0:11:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d564ec6bf43000092aa42d))
- > 每個人都有自己的特質，有些特質會把他們引向可怕的地方，但如果你和別人在一起，你必須不斷地與他們協商，那麼這就打開了的可能性，你們相互修改對方的個性，使你們都變得更健康，你們的共同存在是一種可以成為某種典範的存在，然後這就是孩子與之互動的東西，是父母雙方的統一戰線，所以你得到了這種長期的觀點，我認為這有助於使你成熟，但你也得到機會，成為更全面的心理存在
  each person has their own idiosyncrasies and some of those lead them down the garden path to terrible places but if you're with someone else and you have to negotiate with them constantly then that opens up the 14:00possibility of you mutually modifying each other's personalities so that you both become healthier and that your joint existence is a kind of can be a paragon of sorts and then that's what the child interacts with is that united front of the two parents right and so you get that longevity of view which i think helps to mature you but you also get the opportunity to become more fully fledged as a psychological being ([Time 0:13:48](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d5656a198ccb000977985a))
- > 在你有孩子之前，要想成熟是非常非常困難的，還有其他成熟的方法，但這很難，之所以難，我想是因為**在別人比你更重要之前，你還不成熟**。
  it's very very difficult to mature until you have children and there are other ways of maturing but it's hard and the reason it's hard i think is because **you're not mature until someone else is more important than you** ([Time 0:14:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d5657f198ccb000977985b))
- > 我們的文化中充斥著這樣的觀念，比方說，我們堅持認為所有的家庭都是平等的，我理解從寬容的角度來強調這一點，但我認為它有一個嚴重的缺陷 我認為這可能是我們最難討論的問題 就是你不能在沒有巨大損失的情況下抹平區別 我認為現在不可能放棄異性戀一夫一妻制的理想 是的，如果我們認為有一個理想的人是負責任的，成熟的，有遠見的，誠實的商人，好的球員 ，一個可敬的人 可敬的decent person，然後有一個理想的家庭的最低要求，那就是近似於異性戀的長期異性戀的一夫一妻制，也許你有兩個體面的人結合在一起，然後有一個堅定的平台，為孩子們提供服務，現在的問題是，作為一個理想，我們都沒有達到這個理想，所以右半的人要離婚，在沒有離婚的人中，有相當一部分是的婚姻是非常悲慘的，這並不意味著譴責婚姻，但它確實表明實現這一理想是多麼困難，然後會有一些人失去他們的伴侶，獨自撫養孩子，他們會因為偶然或選擇而獨自撫養孩子，他們似乎沒有理由說什麼，嗯，把他們放在文明社會的界限之外，讓我們說，同樣的道理，取消理想也是不合理的 是的，所以也許我們需要這樣的東西 我們知道理想是什麼，在某種意義上是一個神聖的理想，我們沒有人能夠達到它 但是在這個理想周圍必須有一個空間，人們的個體差異、缺陷、特殊性和特異性不會被如此嚴厲地對待，這本身就會產生反作用，這是對微弱的讚美的損害
  we have this notion that's rife in our culture let's say that's insisted upon that all families are equally are equal and i understand the emphasis on that from the let's call it the tolerance perspective 33:00but i think that it's badly flawed in one manner and i think this will be the hardest thing probably for us to discuss is that you can't flatten out distinctions without a tremendous loss and i don't think it's possible to dispense with the ideal of heterosexual monogamy now as the ideal yes that's so if we think well there's an ideal individual who's responsible and mature and far-seeing and honest an honest trader a good player uh an honorable person honorable 33:30decent person and then there's the minimal requirement for a family that's ideal and that's something approximating heterosexual long-term heterosexual monogamy and maybe you have two decent people united together and then there's a firm platform for children now the problem with that as an ideal is that we all fall short of the ideal and so right half 40 of people are going to get divorced and of the people who don't get divorced a good percentage of them are 34:00in pretty damn miserable marriages now that doesn't condemn marriage but it does show how difficult attaining that ideal is and then there's going to be people who lose their partners and raise children alone and they're going to be people who raise children alone by happenstance or or choice and they it doesn't seem reasonable to what would you say um put them outside the bounds of civilized society let's say that 34:30by the same token it doesn't seem reasonable to dispense with the ideal yeah so maybe we need something like well we know what the ideal is it's a divine ideal in some sense in that none of us can live up to it but then there has to be a space around that ideal where the individual differences and flaws and peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of people aren't treated so harshly that that becomes counterproductive in and of itself it's damning with faint praise ([Time 0:32:43](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56877fb5c230009e09872))
- > 大約有85%的孩子表現出極端的性別障礙，所以他們對自己的身體感到不舒服，渴望成為異性，其中80%到85%的孩子會在18或19歲時自行停止。所以他的假設是讓他們單獨呆著，因為這樣做傷害最小，而且他們中的大多數會在成熟後適應自己的身體，因為他們知道青春期特別是對孩子來說，你可以想象一個男性有更多的女性氣質，也可能有更高的開放性，所以他的身份更容易改變，更有創造力的人，尤其是神經質較高的人，在青春期會感到不舒服，每個人在青春期都會感到不舒服，我們應該把它說清楚，所以你就別管那些人了，別管那些孩子了，但他還表明，就我而言，這是一個致命的事實，即很大一部分有性別障礙的孩子長大後是同性戀者，所以這意味著什麼？ 意味著絕大多數可能高達80的孩子被說服他們居住在錯誤的身體裡，並被以永久和可怕的方式進行手術殘害，他們中絕大多數是同性戀。
  about 85 of kids who manifest extreme gender dysphoria so the sense of discomfort in their own body and a desire to be 52:30the opposite sex 80 to 85 percent of them would desist on their own by the age of 18 or 19. and so his hypothesis was leave them the hell alone because you do the least harm that way and most of them will settle into their bodies as they mature knowing that puberty in particular especially for kids you could imagine a male who has a more feminine temperament and who's also perhaps higher in openness so has a more mutable identity more creative 53:00is going to be and and is going to be especially if higher neuroticism as well is going to be uncomfortable around puberty everyone's uncomfortable around puberty we should we should make that straight and so you just leave those you leave the kids alone but what he also showed and this is the killer fact as far as i'm concerned is that a very large proportion of kids with gender dysphoria grow up and are homosexual yes and so what that means what that certainly 53:30means is that the vast majority it might be as high as 80 of the kids who are being convinced now that they inhabit the wrong bodies and are being surgically mutilated on a in a permanent and terrible manner the overwhelming majority of them are gay ([Time 0:52:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56b1cfb5c230009e09873))
- > 如果你粗心大意，特別是在你的概念和行動中，那麼對這種粗心大意最好的掩飾就是宣稱自己是寬容的，哦，所有的事情都是如此，這是因為你沒有紀律，你對世界沒有任何有序的概念，因為你缺乏紀律，現在你要把這一切當作一種道德美德，我們肯定會看到這種後果，特別是在變性問題上。between tolerance and carelessness is a very difficult one to establish and if you are careless especially in your conceptualization and perhaps in your actions the best mask for that carelessness is to proclaim yourself to be tolerant oh everything goes it's like well that's because you have zero discipline and you have no ordered conceptualization of the world whatsoever because of your lack of discipline. now you're going to pass on all off as a moral virtue and well we're definitely seeing the consequences of that especially in the trans issue ([Time 1:04:23](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56ce1fb5c230009e09874))
- > 每個人都有自己的特質，感謝上帝，我們絕對需要有創造力的人，我們甚至需要一些有創造力的怪人，因為只有上帝知道他們什麼時候會派上用場，但經驗法則仍然應該是在你能夠維護集體社會的規範和理想的程度上，你有道德義務這樣做。
  everyone's got their idiosyncrasies and thank god for that and we definitely need creative people and we even need some creative weirdos you know because god only knows when they'll come in handy but the rule of thumb should still be to the degree that you're able to uphold the norms and ideals of the collective society you have a moral obligation to do that ([Time 1:06:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56d3fda39510009ce735b))
- > 一些傾向於同性戀的因素有生殖方面的好處，它們是如此強大，以至於抵消了無法繁殖的負面後果，可能是，可能是，相當一部分表現在創造力方面。
  there are reproductive benefits to some of the factors that tilt towards homosexuality that are so powerful that they counterbalance the negative consequence of being able to unable to reproduce and it might be it might be that a fair bit of that manifests itself on the creativity side ([Time 1:08:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62d5634450894e0009b21041?annotationId=62d56d8cfb5c230009e0987a))
