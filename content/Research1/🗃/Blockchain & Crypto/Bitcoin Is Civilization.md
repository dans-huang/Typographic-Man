- 4. Crypto Protects Free Speech ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp65m7x76k99skf2b97x7byn))
- The spirit of the First Amendment is under attack from giant technology companies and media corporations, with institutional diktat treated as truth and speech restrictions imposed in the name of content moderation.
