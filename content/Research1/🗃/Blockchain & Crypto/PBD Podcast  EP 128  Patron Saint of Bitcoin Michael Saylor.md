- > 貨幣是能量 貨幣是經濟能量 社會政治能量 貨幣是能量流動的媒介 如果你想 嗯 如果你想持有能量和運輸能量 你需要一種技術 
  money is energy money is economic energy social political energy currency is a medium through which the energy moves um if if you wish to um if you wish to hold energy and transport energy you need a technology ([Time 0:17:17](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b31449760f030009277b8b))
- > 如果我可以用借來的比索在阿根廷買一棟虛擬建築，那不是很好嗎？ 如果我可以把這棟建築帶出國門，租給倫敦或紐約的人 那就是比特幣是數字財產，你可以瞬間傳送到空間的任何地方，而且它也是完美的財產，維護成本最低
  wouldn't it be great if i could buy a virtual building in Argentina using borrowed pesos and then what if i could spirit the building out of the country and rent it to people in London or New York City that's what bitcoin is digital property that you can teleport anywhere in space instantly, and it's also perfected property with 23:00with the lowest maintenance cost ([Time 0:22:31](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b314e2760f030009277b8d))
- > 這個系統的美妙之處在於它本質上是網絡空間的連鎖反應 而連鎖反應的唯一目的是保護網絡的完整性 27:30 永遠不會有超過2100萬的比特幣 所以你得到的是真相和完整性，就像網絡病毒一樣被釋放出來，如果你選擇加入這個網絡 你就能利用這個網絡的所有好處
  the beauty of the system is it's in essence this chain reaction in cyberspace and the only purpose of the chain reaction is to protect the integrity of the network 27:30there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin so what you've got is truth and integrity released as a cyber virus, and you can if you choose to join that network you avail yourself of all of the benefits of that network ([Time 0:27:20](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b3157c760f030009277b8e))
- > 比特幣是一個經過核加固的協議 它是人類迄今為止發明的最強大的彈性的東西 比如說它在成千上萬的節點上運行 你甚至無法識別這些節點 而且每一個節點上都有一個相同的比特幣賬本 所以如果地球上所有的電都被切斷了 地球上所有的電腦都故障了10年 這個協議就會休眠10年 只要有一個人重新打開一個節點 整個協議就會重新復活 31: 沒有什麼比這更好的了 你在銀行和美國銀行的所有錢都可能被抹掉 你知道的，一個按鍵就能抹掉幾台服務器 你知道的，你的大樓可以被炸彈抹掉 對，很多東西都可以被抹掉 但是，嗯，比特幣是網絡空間裡最有彈性的東西 因為它是非常分散的
  bitcoin is a nuclear-hardened protocol it's pretty much the most robust resilient thing that human race has yet to invent for example it's running uh on tens of thousands of nodes you can't even identify the nodes and there's an identical copy of the bitcoin ledger on every one of them so if all the electricity got shut off everywhere on earth and every computer failed everywhere on earth for 10 years the protocol just goes dormant for 10 years and as soon as one person turns one node back on the entire protocol comes back to life again 31:00there's nothing like that right all your money in a bank and bank of america could be wiped out with you know a keystroke you go and you wipe out a few servers you know your building can be wiped out with a bomb right lots of things can be wiped out but but um bitcoin is the most resilient thing in cyberspace because it is so incredibly decentralized ([Time 0:30:17](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b315fbd0c4790009fc1394))
- > 比特幣是一種數字能源，這是一個偉大的想法 我們把錢加密了，這是一個偉大的想法 因為大多數人不知道錢是什麼，所以不知道錢是能源 因為他們不知道錢是什麼，所以不知道錢是有缺陷的，能量正在從他們的貨幣中流失 順便說一下，如果錢是能源，能量會進入貨幣，也會進入股票、債券和財產，它們都在隨著時間或空間的推移而流失能量
  bitcoin is it's digital energy right this is a big idea we've encrypted money right it's such a huge idea since most people don't know what money is it doesn't occur then that money is energy 35:30since they don't understand what money is they don't really understand that money is defective that the energy is bleeding out of their currency and by the way if if money is energy the energy finds its way into a currency it also finds its way into into stocks and into bonds and into property they're all bleeding energy over time or over space ([Time 0:35:18](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b316d1760f030009277b8f))
- > 比特幣真的很聰明，因為他們所做的是創造了一個熱力學上合理的貨幣網絡，允許你在任何時間段內儲存任何數量的能量 並在基本上沒有成本的情況下將其在空間的任何地方頻繁移動，只要你想。
  bitcoin is truly brilliant because what they've done is they've created a thermodynamically sound monetary network that allows you to store any amount of energy for any period of time 37:00and move it at essentially no cost anywhere in space as frequently as you want ([Time 0:36:45](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b316ea760f030009277b90))
- > 通貨膨脹不是百分之二，通貨膨脹不是CPI，也不是百分之七點五，通貨膨脹正確的理解是任何東西的價格在作為參考框架的貨幣中升值的速度。
  inflation is not two percent inflation is not the cpi it's not seven and a half percent inflation uh properly understood is simply the rate at which the price of anything appreciates in the currency which is the frame of reference ([Time 0:39:42](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b3176bb995060008e9d27d))
- > 那麼什麼是真正的通貨膨脹率呢？ 這是一個矢量，而不是一個標量，標量就是百分之二，不是的，它是一個N維的矢量，每個地方每個時間段都有不同的通貨膨脹率，動態地變化著。
  so what's the real inflation rate it's a vector right it's not a scalar a scalar is like two percent no it's not it's like an n-dimensional vector and there's a different inflation rate for everything in every place for every time period dynamically evolving ([Time 0:40:15](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b31777760f030009277b91))
- > 首先，分散投資的問題是，分散投資是賣出贏家，買入輸家，分散投資的第二個問題是，你根本沒有真正分散投資，因為你擁有的一切可能都與一種正在崩潰的貨幣相關。
  first of all the problem with diversification is diversification is selling the winner to buy the losers and the second problem with diversification is you're not really diversified at all because everything you own is probably correlated to one currency which is collapsing ([Time 0:46:33](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b31884b995060008e9d27e))
- > 當你有一個占主導地位的數字壟斷時，數字壟斷會吃掉其他一切，蘋果電腦是世界上最有價值的公司，因為蘋果電腦是世界上最有價值的公司，他們可以在週末以五分錢的價格向10億人運送產品，而他們的競爭對手卻不能，所以賣掉贏家去買輸家是一個可怕的策略。
  when you have a dominant digital monopoly the digital monopoly eats everything else and apple computer is the most valuable company in the world because apple computer is literally the most valuable company in the world they can ship a product to a billion people over the weekend for a nickel and their competitors can't so selling the winner 48:30to buy the loser is an awful strategy ([Time 0:48:09](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b318c8b995060008e9d27f))
- > 大多數時候，這些模型的通貨膨脹率是2%或CPI，你知道我們應該保持多樣化，它們是基於這種非常傳統的智慧，即我生活在這個安全的世界裡，什麼都沒有改變，就像沒有當哥斯拉出現在遊樂場的時候，遊戲規則會改變，對吧，如果有外部因素，對吧，你有這個模型，就像它一直是這樣，在過去30年裡一直是這樣交易的，以及美國。 美元在過去30年裡從來沒有崩潰過，美元在30年裡損失了7%的價值，所以你的模型說買入房產和買入S P指數，當美元損失了21%的價值時會發生什麼呢？
  most of the time these models inflation is two percent or cpi and you know we should stay diversified they're based upon this very conventional wisdom that i live in this safe world and nothing has changed 53:30like there is no when godzilla shows up to the playground the rules of the game change right if there's an external factor right you have this model it's like it's always been like this it's always traded like this in the last 30 years well the u.s dollar never collapsed in the past 30 years the u.s dollar is losing 7 percent of its value for 30 years so your model says buy property and buy the s p index 54:00what happens when the us dollar is losing 21 percent of its value right it's like that's a different thing ([Time 0:53:16](https://annotate.tv/watch/62b082ebdb59c50009d75e0d?annotationId=62b31988b995060008e9d306))
