- the mathematical description of reality is where we're
  always led and these equations are it's fantastically accurate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grxb51ma7z84krbseq14dhfp))
- our picture of physical reality depends on something in the sense which is more precise at least in our understanding of it than then then how we think about the world and this precision really dates back to the ancient Greeks the time of Pythagoras and later where they developed the mathematical ideas as afield of study stimulated to some degree by physical reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0myyjcrpkwn45s26prtk9q))
- the mathematical reality is something different it's it's sometimes referred to as a platonic world platonic reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n4eht7d06nap7712jknph))
- there being different ways of looking at reality there's the reality of our mental experience which okay interrelates with the reality physical reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n24c5djyfvq3b5cwqvcjb))
- and so then there's the mathematical reality of this platonic world which gives reality to these notions so if you like mathematical facts like there is no largest prime number is if it's something independent of ourselves it's always been true ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n2x38bs7gdzr5t3t0s02r))
- in a sense that had to be so because if the physical world depended so precisely on these mathematical laws I couldn't have known what to do in a certain sense if the mathematics hadn't already been there I mean it's not us that imposes this on the world that's it's out there ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n5q1yhsrax4vypgec3v8j))
- people think that you know maybe reason we have good mathematical laws of physics is that's the best way we can come to understand the world but it's something more than that it really is out there in the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n684gpgvxkw697vnrc0j9))
- Einstein produced his theory mostly out of his head with that appealing to know things that were known to Galileo and so on but apart from that it was not much more empirical evidence but he produced his theory which extended far beyond anything that the observations at that time told us about and they keep on agreeing with the observation so that theory which is if you like a a platonic absolute thing and it's a mathematical thing seems to be inbuilt into the way the world operates ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n8hyzvtk7cqckekqnb0zz))
- these really good physical theories are not like that you're revealing something in the way the world operates which is there all the time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0n923fxm5g228kwv08gjs3))
- I think there two aspects to mathematics please how I look at it some people are just exploring the mathematics and that's their real interest and it's the beauty and the subject often and that's why they're doing it because they find it exhilarating something they find really wonderful to do but there's the other side of it which is how it relates to the physical world and there is this extraordinary precision that we find when you get the mathematics right it really mirrors the behavior of the physical world to an unbelievable degree and so there's these two sides to mathematics it has this reality which you can study quite independently of its role in physics and the other side which is how it really does seem to reveal how the real world operates in a certain sense what the world is as far as we can understand it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs0ndngyrqsehb9gnjdpzwf3))
