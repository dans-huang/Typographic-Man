title: "健全貨幣、能源、創新、馬克思"

貨幣是能源被人類開發後作為儲存的媒介。
貨幣應是有限的，相應於地球上有限的能源。
貨幣總數的限制致使，唯一能提升人們購買力的方式，即是創新。

但在擁有健全貨幣的社會裡，創新的動機為何？
資本主義自由市場中，唯有能替人們帶來比單純囤積貨幣更高報酬的創新，才可能使人願意投資。無謂的創業點子，和亂槍打鳥的投資將不復存在；為成長和消費而出現的產品及服務將不再有意義——同金本位時代。

因貨幣與有限能源相應，獲取利潤的方式，唯有提供人們想要的產品和服務、或發明更有效率獲取能源的方式，即科技的創新。
參考中世紀梅地奇家族之銀行業興旺，或可證明銀行未必需要創造更多貨幣以進行投資、刺激創新；
相反地，資本社會中的創業家或許根本不需要、也不應該太多，而僅有部份才能出眾者應創業。大眾或可能樂見遍地開花的創業家，但那或許更多是貨幣量增加（以追求經濟成長）的副作用。
因此，貨幣是人類對能源的開價，而並非總是銀行與民眾的承諾維繫。

馬克思認為：資本主義的利潤，來自勞工（但其實也是用機器）的生產價值和生產成本間的差距所產生。他推論資本主義社會必將面臨邊際利潤的降低，導致資本家勢必得壓榨勞工以獲取利潤，因此資本主義社會必將走向社會主義。
馬克思最大的錯誤，在於低估了創新所帶來的價值，這也體現於後來奉行馬克思主義的國家為什麼都極為欠缺創新、創業、創意。馬克思形塑的理論，正如其實踐的案例，均不見創新在其中扮演的角色。
是故，資本主義的單一產品/服務的邊際效益會降低，但只要人有自由，就會企圖解決問題、進行改良和創新（無論是產品、服務、或提取能源的方式），進而再一次提高效益，或該說，是提高貨幣的購買力。
就目前而言，若假想這樣的經濟模式在人類殖民的火星上運作，似乎仍是合理而可行的。

# Price of Energy
- We never pay the price for energy, since our adoption of the classical/neo-classical economy theory (in which we price everything somewhere between its use value and manufacturing value).
- In our current capitalist economic system, we are taxed according to our income, which has to do with our labor and skill. That, in turn, puts the emphasis on each person's ability, skill, and 'marketable' traits.
- A better system that encourage and make easy people's virtue, which by definition will need to lower people's time preference, will be taxing people not by their income, but their consumption. The consumption of the goods that take more energy to produce, will be taxed more heavily to reflect the diminishing natural resource. 
- By taxing according to energy consumption, essentially encourages lower energy consumption and more moderate way of living. Human desires will not be eliminated because we will always have desires, but people will be encouraged to put their emphasis on things that come free in life, such as family, friendship, love.
- Combining this with the fixed-quantity sound money, we'll have a much smaller economy that does not enslave people for infinite consumption and economic growth, but one that is driven by human passion, virtue, and innovation.

- **However, I'll still have to ponder on whether this 'resource-constrained' economy (unlike the current 'demand-driven' model) will end up being just like the soviet union, where no actual innovation happens, or will it become a better world for people where we're no longer enslaved by the capitalist hamster wheel and instead focus on the real worth-while things in life and see innovations that actually make people's lives better (not just pure entertainment).**
  

# Fossil Fuel

- **Fossil fuel is the ultimate 'free lunch'** human will likely ever get.
  **Fossil fuel** is the most '**pro-human**' energy - it's cheap, reliable, and uniquely superior at raising billions of people out of poverty.
- Environmental activists are essentially supporting the policy to save the future generation by leaving billions of people today suffer. Many are not even willing to pay the real price of their vision, but wants others to suffer or voluntarily self-sterile to sustain their own quality of live.
  Ref: [[Alex Epstein - The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels]]
  
# Nuclear

- **Nuclear power** has the most potential, and should be considered the '**fairest**' energy - its waste is the ONLY kind that's responsibly contained and internalized, instead of emitting into the environment as pollution and material waste. 
- However it's probably the most misunderstood and stigmatized energy. People exaggerate its danger, and refuse to see why 'responsibly containing the waste of our own electricity production' is a fair and proper act. Most people don't notice the contradiction as to why they don't ever need to bother with the waste of any other types of electricity production.
