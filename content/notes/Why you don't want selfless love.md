Don't let your children do something you dislike

people think ideally love gotta be selfless, without asking for anything back, and that is the true essence of love. and thus people thing when we speak of anything in 'exchange' in love, it's not genuine and is manipulative and calculative.

that's simply not true. we love not only because we want to love, but we also want to be loved in return. Love IS an exchange when done right, and it can be a healthy one. on the contrary, when a love has nothing exchanging between 2 people, it can often times leads to suffering

imagine your spouse one day becomes 植物人, as much as you love her, you'll not be able to love her the way you used to when she's able to love you back, in the way that this love can manifest in the world as very tangible things and expressions.

the love you give someone when they're able to love you back, is simply different from the love you can give them when there'll be no response.

The definition of love goes both ways, even if it's only coming from one person.

so selfless love, in which the person giving the love lose/forget about himself in the loving, often leads to frustration or ever resentment when this love is not responded accordingly.

That's why in toxic and abusive relationships, one will suffer endlessly even if she loves the other person so selflessly and want nothing to him, while the other person continues to abuse and use her.

That's also why when you're dealing with your teenage child and giving him all the love you can but he's responding in coldness, you'll grow resentful even if it's your own child.

You do not want to love someone selfless, at least not for the most part in your life. Love goes both ways, and you definitely want to love (/treat) someone (properly) in a way that it's more or less possible for the other person to love (/treat) you back (properly).

In a selfless love, there's no self, no caring for oneself, and that's a big mistake, because you can be very likely loving in a way that is not caring for yourself, or even not honoring yourself as a sovereign individual.

So when you love someone, definitely beware whether you're loving and caring about yourself in this love you give. We live as social animals, and we want to love others in a way that it's likely that they'll love us back. This is a crucial part of our relationship with the community, and determine our wellbeing in each of our relationships tremendously.

In this life, we want to learn to love and to be loved, and we want both at the same time. You want to take care of yourself while caring for others, because as much as you love the next person, you should always start with loving yourself.

You need to see yourself as a valuable individual in order for your love to have value to others, instead of letting love rule over you and letting yourself become a slave to any relationship. It's not a proper way to treat yourself by letting yourself become a slave to any relationship, and it's not a proper way to love someone else by letting them become the tyrant who rules over you in the name of love, whether that person is doing this consciously or not.

We want to live in this cycle of love where we love and can be loved back. That's the healthy balance we should aim for, not the 'ideal' selfless love that only lives in fantasy but simply doesn't work in the real life.
